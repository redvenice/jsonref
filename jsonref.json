We piled onto the coach to take us to London at 5.30am.‘Catherine — who even then was fantastic at building a team and keeping up morale — led everyone in endless rounds of Ten Green Bottles.

The pair were known as Middleton C and Middleton P. James (right) was to start in 1991‘Many parents came. Carole was busy, but I remember her ringing regularly to check progress. When we got home all the parents were there to meet us with mounds of fish and chips and dozens of bottles of champagne.’Both Denise and Kevin are quick to point out that while Carole was an involved parent, she was far from pushy. ‘There were some parents whose voices you dreaded hearing on the phone,’ says Kevin. ‘And Carole was definitely not one of them. When she rang — which she rarely did — she would have a point.‘For example, Catherine had obviously told her she thought it was unfair the boys had a big common room with a pool table and the girls didn’t.‘Carole rang and asked why. We agreed it was unfair and, entirely as a result of her intervention, rules were changed. From then on it was a joint common room.’But while it was Carole who made the tricky phone calls, it was left to her husband Mike to be the school entertainer.‘Like in most marriages, the woman is in charge,’ says Denise. ‘Mike had the most gorgeous sense of humour. You could have a joke with him.‘At the end of every term, we always had a parents’ match — the girls’ netball team would play the parents and Mike would turn up and be the joker. He would be the one challenging the referee’s decisions and pretending to cheat. Everyone adored him.’Small wonder then that St Andrew’s holds such a very special place in the Duchess of Cambridge’s heart.‘We met her at one of the happiest periods of our lives,’ says Denise. ‘It’s lovely to know that Catherine feels the same.’Denise and Kevin have asked the Mail to make a donation to Wales Air Ambulance in return for this interview."},{"url":null,"title":"Caroline Flack pens self help book losing job presenting Love Island","story":"Share this article   A star of Belgravia, ITV’s forthcoming drama by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, Alice Eve is now an oil painting, too.The Duchess of Cornwall’s former nephew Sam Parker Bowles commissioned award-winning painter Jamie Coreth to immortalise Star Trek actress Alice for a new exhibition at the Fine Art Commissions gallery in Mayfair, where he’s manager.

The champion was 24 and preparing to fight Henry Cooper in London, but he had recently alienated many fans in the States by joining up with the Nation of Islam, speaking in favour of racial segregation and declaring that he would not fight for his country in Vietnam. “I don’t have no quarrel with those Viet Congs!”Parks was a significant figure in black American culture – he was not only a photographer but also a novelist, musician and film director (he went on to make the 1971 movie Shaft). He went to see Ali on something of a mission. He wanted to reclaim the fighter as a true American hero, show Ali’s humanity at a time when the press was calling him a brash and “shameless traitor”. Parks was encouraged as soon as he walked into Ali’s hotel room. “Sit down,” Ali said. “They tell me you’re the greatest.”In the weeks that the pair spent together, Parks gained the full trust of the boxer, watching him training, but also relaxing with his family and friends and in private moments of prayer and meditation. In return, in an extraordinary series of pictures and a long essay, Parks began to shape a new understanding of Ali, calling his story “The Redemption of the Champion”. This picture, not published with that original essay, but now included in a book of Parks’s photographs of Ali, shows the photographer finding a way to express what he saw as the fighter’s inner peace and strength. A surprising image of the “motormouth” at the time, it now looks an entirely natural portrait of the man Ali was to become.Gordon Parks: Muhammad Ali is out now (Steidl, £45).

Horta-Osório took home £6.3m in 2018 – 359 times more than staff on the bank’s minimum salary of £17,510.While such pay disparity isn’t unique to Lloyds, its chief executive remains one of the 20 highest-paid bosses of a FTSE 100 company in the UK and it has faced investor pressure over its approach to remuneration. In June, Lloyds executives were summoned by MPs who accused the bank’s bosses of “boundless greed”. The bank’s remuneration committee chair claimed staff viewed the boss as a “winner” and did not “resent the money” pocketed by the chief executive.The bank is now consulting with shareholders over plans to slash Horta-Osório’s pension by £220,000 and spend £20m to raise retirement benefits for the rest of staff. It was reported last week that Horta-Osório’s pay could be cut by more than £1m under a new bonus scheme that pays out a set number of shares.However, it is not clear whether that will make up for a cut to the annual staff bonus payout at Lloyds. The bonus is expected to fall for the first time in four years owing to numerous factors including a last-ditch surge in payment protection insurance (PPI) claims.Responding to the survey, a Lloyds spokesman said: “The welfare of our colleagues is of utmost importance to the group, and demonstrated by the further measures it has introduced recently such as on mental health support and also doubling paid maternity leave.“The group has also taken steps to offer fair and competitive pay for colleagues across the organisation, for example by having salary increases for colleagues that are both higher than that received by executive directors and also higher than inflation.

Houchen wants to decontaminate and redevelop the site into a low-CO2 manufacturing hub, creating 20,000 jobs in the next 20 years.The site has stood rusting on the North Sea coast for more than four years amid squabbles over how much it is worth. An independent valuation estimated the contested 352 hectares at just under £20m, but the banks – which lent SSI £800m in the year before it went into liquidation – claim it is worth “tens of millions of pounds more”, according to Houchen.It currently costs UK taxpayers £20m a year just to keep the mothballed site safe, by Houchen’s calculation. About 300 people still work there as engineers, technicians and security guards.Demolishing and decontaminating the site would cost about £190m, said Houchen. He leads a new body, the South Tees Development Corporation (STDC), that wants to redevelop the whole site, which is – as Houchen likes to point out – “three times the size of Gibraltar, six times the size of the City of London and 1.5 times the footprint of Heathrow.”STDC has already acquired 575 hectares of land on the site but a 12-day public inquiry begins on Tuesday to decide whether the government can grant the STDC a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on the SSI land.Redcar voted in its first Conservative MP in December, and in January the government committed £71m to pay for the CPO and future decontamination work.After his surprise election as mayor in May 2017, Houchen began negotiations to secure the former SSI land with the three banks in Thailand who hold a charge over the SSI UK’s assets – Tisco, the Siam Commercial Bank and the state-owned Krung Thai bank.In May 2018 Houchen flew to Thailand to try to persuade the banks to sell up. He returned home with what he thought was an agreement, only for the Thai bankers, led by Krung Thai, to change their minds over what the site was worth and play what he calls “a load of silly games”.He said: “It is an absolute travesty that the UK taxpayer has to pay a penny for any of this, all because there was a bad business deal done by SSI UK, which went bust, and three Thai banks who can’t get their money back.“There absolutely needs to be a review of what mechanism is in place for large industrial complexes and businesses if a company goes bust.” Houchen noted that Teesside was also home to the largest chemical works in western Europe. He said: “God forbid any of that goes bust because we will be in the same position.”The banks all object to the CPO, saying “a gross lack of transparency exists due to STDC’s near total failure to publish its relevant meeting agendas, reports and minutes”. They also accuse the Tees Valley combined authority, led by Houchen, of hiding behind confidentiality clauses to avoid handing over “key documentation”.Houchen said the Thai banks did not understand the importance of the site for Teesside, which produced steel for landmarks like the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Canary Wharf in London and the new World Trade Center in New York.He said: “I met the Thai ambassador to the UK in London to impress on him the importance of it, and he seemed completely disengaged. He said he would follow up with me on a number of points and I never heard from him again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18fb34a58ddafa6794eb39932267a353ca66eb28/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91b4eabd6509a59804f4b407741759c0","title":"misinformation coronavirus contagious infections","story":"And the best way to tackle these online rumours? Treat them like a real-life virus• Adam Kucharski is an epidemiologist and authorWhen reports of a new coronavirus emerged last month, I speculated with fellow epidemiologists about what the media might end up naming the infection. None of us would have guessed that within a week or so a theory would be circulating that coronavirus was a new kind of “snake flu”– mostly because it’s unlikely the virus originated in snakes, and it’s not flu.So where did the snakes come from? The culprit was a widely shared scientific paper, which speculated that the new virus had genetic characteristics and implicated snakes as the source. Leading geneticists were quick to point out that the results weren’t convincing, and that bats were still the likely suspects. However, that didn’t stop snake flu from going viral. Other misinformation about coronavirus has rippled across the internet in recent weeks. From claims the virus is part-HIV to conspiracy theories about bioweapons and reports suggesting the virus was linked to people eating bat soup, stories sparking fear seem to have overtaken the outbreak in real life. Is misinformation really more contagious than the virus itself?It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\u0026nbspThe virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, and a third person was diagnosed with it in Brighton, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can. Five new cases in France are British nationals, and British nationals are also among the 64 cases on a cruise liner off Japan.The number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsp(WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP’s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.We typically think of viral content as a chain reaction: you share something with friends, they share it with their friends, and so on. In disease outbreak analysis, we can measure the transmission of an infection by looking at how many additional cases each infected person creates on average during each of these steps. We call this the “reproduction number”, and for coronavirus, we estimate it’s about 2 for a typical infected case in China. What about the reproduction number for online content? A couple of years ago, Facebook researchers looked at the most shared content on the platform from 2014 to 2016, including viral trends such as the ice-bucket challenge and putting an equals sign over your profile picture to support marriage equality.Remarkably, there wasn’t much difference in the transmission. Researchers found the reproduction number was about 2 for all of them. Remember, these were the most shared ideas on Facebook the vast majority of online content is lucky to get even a single repost.To fully explain how viral content – and viruses – spread, we need to move away from the idea that outbreaks involve simple clockwork infections, passing along a chain from person to person to person until large numbers have been exposed. During the 2015 outbreak of the Mers coronavirus in South Korea, 82 out of 186 infections came from a single “superspreading event” in a hospital where an infected person was being treated. It’s not yet clear how common such superspreading is in the current outbreak, but we do know that these kinds of events are how information goes viral online most outbreaks on Twitter are dominated by a handful of iniduals or media outlets, which are responsible for a large proportion of transmission. If you heard about snake flu, you might have told a couple of friends meanwhile, newspaper headlines were telling millions.When tackling disease outbreaks, health agencies often work to identify potential superspreading events, isolating infected iniduals to prevent further transmission. However, this isn’t the only way to stop an outbreak. As well as tracking down people who are infectious, it’s possible to target broader social interactions that might amplify transmission. For example, many cities in China have recently closed schools, which can be hotspots for respiratory infections.Tech companies are now adopting similar approaches to tackle health misinformation. Last year, Pinterest announced it had rewired its search results to make it harder to find vaccine misinformation. It had struggled to remove the content completely – the equivalent of finding all the cases during a disease outbreak – so instead focused on reducing how many people might be exposed to harmful content. During the current outbreak, Google is attempting to reduce people’s susceptibility to misinformation by displaying links to reputable health sources when users search for information about the virus.These combined approaches, which target different aspects of transmission, have long been used in disease control. By introducing analogous strategies online, we should have a better chance of effectively curbing harmful viral content.Ensuring the public has the best possible health information is crucial during an outbreak. At best, misinformation can distract from important messages. At worst, it can lead to behaviour that amplifies disease transmission. The novelty of coronavirus makes the challenge even greater, because viral speculation can easily overwhelm the limited information we do have. The scientific community is already making huge progress in understanding the infection, but we’ve had to start at the bottom, without stacks of earlier research to stand on. When it comes to stopping the outbreak, we’ll need ladders, not snakes.• Adam Kucharski an epidemiologist and the author of The Rules of Contagion: Why Things Spread – and Why They Stop, published on 13 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8880bd6c24b85b23c9095ac8487416feb3c6a459/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c9e41a3526d54adce79855ba6cf0fdc","title":"bernie sanders campaign people tech obama big data","story":"In a break from Obama’s big-tech data-gathering era, Bernie Sanders’ team prizes trust and empowermentThe Iowa caucuses this week were a tale of two political technologies. There was Shadow Inc’s disastrous app for tallying votes, funded by a team drawn from Obama-era politics and technology, which failed due to impossible timelines, a lack of training and testing, and a likely measure of hubris. And then there was the political technology of Bernie Sanders’ campaign, which won the popular vote in Iowa.Each of these point to differing approaches to the interaction between politics and technology in Democrat election campaigns over the past decade or so. It is the key difference between an approach characterised by mobilising (top-down and centralised) and one characterised by organising (bottom-up and distributed).Partly by virtue of its sheer scale, US electoral politics has always been a proving ground for new deployments of political technology. The first time digital technology was adopted with real success was Barack Obama’s first campaign in 2008, which made effective use of social media that was in its infancy, putting effort into Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and, this being the 2000s, MySpace. The campaign threw $100m into technology, but it was not without its missteps: Obama’s team also created Project Houdini, a system designed to give almost real-time updates on the get-out-the-vote drive in high-priority precincts. On the day, however, the phone lines jammed and the system was a failure.By the 2012 presidential election, the situation had changed. The Obama campaign’s bespoke Narwhal software marked a step up in volunteer mobilisation and microtargeting of voters. Part of its functionality relied upon a huge data mining operation – drawing from Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Pinterest – to find voters, discover their interests and preferences, and monitor message effectiveness and targeting. Ironically, this was the precedent for Cambridge Analytica’s infamous work. Few at the time considered the ethical implications.Obama’s campaigns cast a long shadow over the state of technology used in the Democratic party. Especially after the defeat of the centre-left in 2016, those associated with the party in this era looked to Silicon Valley-style innovation to generate the next technical advantage: venture capital, incubators and startups. Founded by Shomik Dutta and Betsy Hoover, who had worked on both Obama’s campaigns, Higher Ground Labs emerged as an investor and incubator in new technologies to aid the Democratic party, investing $15m and funding dozens of political technology startups. And Acronym, the tech consultancy that launched Shadow Inc, was founded by Tara McGowan, a digital producer on Obama’s 2012 campaign.Innovation in campaigning techniques is important. But that’s not always the kind of innovation that Silicon Valley recognises. In 2016, it came from Sanders’ campaign. This reflected his democratic socialist politics: it was willing to trust regular people, while employing some of the oldest campaigning tricks in the book.Using a strategy named “distributed organising”, a small team of full-time staff was supplemented by thousands of technical volunteers, contributing to open source code repositories and creating tools that tied together commercial technologies such as Google Sheets with specialist political software. Downstream, many many more volunteers worked on the ground. The Sanders campaign did not junk data entirely, but supplemented it with face-to-face interaction. The “big data’’ of the Obama era had given way to big organising. Niche targeting of specific demographics gave way to a social democratic, universalist message regarding issues such as healthcare.The techniques that evolved out of these campaigns have increasingly emphasised “relational organising”: placing relations, conversations and existing human networks at the centre of efforts, rather than data-based targeting. In 2020, the Sanders campaign’s Bern app is encouraging people to “have open, honest, and thorough conversations with our friends, family, and neighbours” and record their information, persuading them over the course of the campaign. This simple technique is a hallmark of traditional campaigning, but the communication power of digital technology helps it take place on a massive scale.The key distinction between the Obama campaigns and the Sanders campaigns is the distinction between mobilising and organising. Obama’s campaign didn’t lack organising chops – Obama himself was a community organiser. But its tech functioned like a brand: it tried to mobilise people to do something. Sanders’ campaign, by contrast, is seeking to organise people, like a social movement, to do it themselves, and the tech follows this. The campaign relies heavily on supporters but, in distinction to the Obama era, makes them the centre of the campaign – they aren’t treated as volunteers who are less important than staffers, but as full participants and even experts, running whole chunks of the campaign.The lesson is that organising tactics work best when they are enabled and supplemented, rather than replaced, by digital technology. The focus for any progressive campaign should be on building relationships, trust and power and using these to deliver political change. Yet there is something about the timescale of elections that makes this difficult.Electoral campaigns create innovation in political technology, but they are finite and separate from most day-to-day political work. When they come to an end, the technology that enabled the campaign is quickly dropped, making it hard to develop it further, put it to other uses or build upon it.Sanders has said that Obama’s “biggest mistake” was, after the election, saying: “Thank you very much for electing me, I’ll take it from here.” If Sanders succeeds in becoming president, the challenge for his campaign is to ensure that the movement he is attempting to build continues to have power. Seeing elections as just a tactic in a wider strategy of building power in workplaces and communities is part of the answer. If Sanders’ campaign slogan “Not me, us” is to become a reality, new and different political technologies will need to emerge, not tied to electoral cycles.• Common Knowledge is a workers cooperative based in London.

As the exit polls showed, Ireland has three-party politics now. Yet, in an important sense, there is no new kid on the block. Sinn Féin’s roots in Irish history go back even further than those of its rivals. The other two parties have said they will not go into coalition with it because of the past. Yet the alternative is far from obvious. None of the three parties is ascendant. Fine Gael has held on a bit better than at one time seemed likely. Fianna Fáil’s vote share is down on the last election in 2016. Sinn Féin, which undoubtedly has the momentum, was as surprised by its campaign surge as its opponents. The result is unquestionably a vote for change. But the kind of change that the voters want is far from settled.The danger for Ireland is that this will all lead to a frustratingly familiar outcome and that there will be no decisive break after all. The exit polls log the voters’ first preferences – and these show a three-horse race stalemate. But under Ireland’s multi-member constituency proportional representation electoral system, this does not mean that there will be the same stalemate in the 160-seat Dáil. Counting got under way in earnest on Sunday, but when it is over – and this count could go down to the wire in several constituencies – Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael may stretch an advantage. That’s partly because Sinn Féin ran only 42 candidates across Ireland’s 39 constituencies and partly because many voters have in any case been traditionally unwilling to give second-preference votes to Sinn Féin.Ever since 1981, Ireland’s governments have either produced coalitions or minority administrations (and sometimes both at once). That is likely to remain the same after this inconclusive election. The talking between the parties will occupy the weeks to come. Yet everything points eventually to another coalition, possibly to another minority government and, quite possibly, to another general election, perhaps even this year. The 2020 Irish contest was unquestionably what the political class likes to call a “change election”. It cannot be good for Ireland that, for now, the outcome looks likely not to be change but may instead mean more of the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ca54f8bbbe058bf7d552da581d50115725ae78e/0_122_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c0e917c64bfdff56291cdf30711b5d0","title":"julian cope review brighton concorde 2 the teardrop explodes","story":"Concorde 2, BrightonWarmth, humour and real depth lie behind the dense beard and sunglasses of this eccentric artist, whose 40 years of baffling discography never fails to entertainBy anyone’s standards, Julian Cope has had a remarkable career. Plenty of artists went from the post-punk indie underground to the pages of Smash Hits and the stages of Top of the Pops, but only Cope attempted to do it while existing on a diet largely comprised of LSD – with inevitably chaotic results. Later in the 80s, he went from being dismissed as a hopeless acid casualty – his record company, he recalls tonight, baulked at the release of his 1985 single Sunspots, not least because the chorus largely consisted of Cope vocally impersonating the noise of a car driving past – to a brief period as a mainstream rock star.From there he ed into cult-dom of a particularly esoteric nature, where learned books on prehistoric archaeology and Krautrock rub shoulders with the kind of baffling discography you can only get away with if you release your own albums. Songs sit alongside spoken word, and then there’s the likes of 1999’s Odin, which, depending on your perspective, is either a meditational device designed to allow listeners to communicate with “the granite sub-basement of the underworld”, or 72 minutes of Julian Cope humming.It’s the stuff of which rabidly devoted followings are made – the venue is sold out – and the kind of serpentine path that’s almost impossible to make sense of in 90 minutes. Yet on stage Cope somehow manages it. Hidden behind a dense beard, sunglasses and what looks like a Luftwaffe cap, he’s nevertheless a warm and extremely funny performer. For all the weirdness, there’s a real depth to his work, informed by his eclectic passions. Between songs, the topics range from politics to the use of ephedra by ancient civilisations – “whenever cultures are achieving their pinnacle, it’s not the product of the smug and the cynical – it’s the ones on drugs,” offers the subsequent song – to the vacillations of Cope’s own career.Stripping the songs back to acoustic guitar, albeit an acoustic guitar that comes with a side order of distortion and wah effects, lays bare the melodies that occasionally get lost in the studio amid Cope’s penchant for lo-fi experimentation. He can hop neatly from the Teardrop Explodes’ punchy 1981 hit Passionate Friend, to the expansive Autogeddon Blues, to a consideration of social media in Your Facebook, My Laptop from his most recent album, Self Civil War.Indeed, you can occasionally see a clear musical link between what Cope did then and what he does now: he plays an as-yet unreleased song that harks back to what he calls the “ba-ba-ba” years – after the kind of vocals that regularly appeared on Teardrop Explodes songs – complete with pure pop tune, sparkling chorus and “ba-ba-ba” interjections. Alas, its commercial progress may be impeded by the fact that it’s called Cunts Can Fuck Off. “I’m making lists of all the people I love,” he sings, “and all the cunts who can fuck off”, a sentiment it’s very hard not to get behind in what the sleeve of Self Civil War calls “our troubled times”. In fact, 41 years on from the Teardrop Explodes’ debut single, it’s very hard not to get behind Julian Cope: uncompromising cult heroes come no more engaging."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230991959691554728c46278e8bbd4684402103e/0_0_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6729dd661e0866c9b392a9765d49696","title":"committees blind hiring and flexible work how to build a diverse workforce","story":"By limiting yourself in the recruitment process you may miss out on someone who’s right for the job. These simple steps will help to cultivate an inclusive organisationBut ersity isn’t limited to a candidate’s race, gender, or age – it includes their education, socioeconomic background, sexuality, religion, mental and physical health and many more facets. When we create environments that encourage different opinions and contain a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, we broaden our communities, which in turn benefits both the work and the culture of the organisation.Here’s how to get started with building an inclusive and erse business:Look outside of the obvious education channelsThis may come as a surprise, but where someone studied - for their qualifications – doesn’t necessarily correlate to their qualities as a candidate. It’s important to be intentional about recruitment, and if you are only accepting candidates who have a certain level of education, or attended a certain type of university, you may be missing out on someone just right for the job. Go further afield when you attend university job fairs and remember to think digitally. With an increasing number of courses being offered online, make sure you connect with those graduates as well. The Open University has been offering qualifications through distance learning for 50 years. It has an excellent resource – the OU’s OpportunityHub, which connects prospective employers with graduates and alumni around the country for work and internships. The OU also regularly runs OU Online TalentConnect, a digital careers fair where employers can chat and interact with its uniquely erse body of graduates and undergraduates all over the UK and internationally.“The OU provides a unique supply of candidates, as a majority study alongside full-time employment – it shows a true commitment and a willingness to go that extra mile,” says the HMRC’s Memunatu Bangura.Create a ersity, equity, and inclusion committeeHave a specific committee to oversee ersity, equity, and inclusion at your organisation, to ensure that not only the roles you are hiring, but the work that you do appeals to a broad group of people. Of course, ersity isn’t just about hiring – but it’s probably a good idea to ensure that the team responsible for hiring are erse themselves.Could the role be remote? Or part-time?For many candidates, especially those with disabilities, knowing that a job can be done remotely, or part-time, is deeply attractive. You can also sign up to be a part of the Disability Confident programme, which signals to jobseekers with disabilities that your organisation supports and encourages a talent pool that is inclusive. When pulling together your job description, think seriously about whether it would be possible to offer remote work, or a job share – many parents benefit from flexible schedules.Consider mature studentsNot everyone attends university. Many candidates from lower-income backgrounds, or BAME candidates, may not have been given the same access to opportunity as others, and many people choose to attend university later in life, if at all. Mature students are defined as being undergraduates over the age of 21, and they account for almost 300,000 people a year. According to Ucas, the majority of mature students are women who live at home, undertaking degrees in vocational subjects. These are candidates who will have learned to juggle work, or parenting, alongside their studies.“We want to work with OU students and graduates because we know they are highly motivated and talented iniduals who have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Mencap as either staff or volunteers. We work across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we know that OU students are spread across the whole of the UK too,” says Jen Stoneman, volunteer services coordinator at Mencap.Be realistic about your goalsWhile it would be amazing to cultivate a erse work environment, it won’t happen overnight. Be patient, and set metrics of success that ensure that you are appealing to erse groups, and growing your workforce. Identify one metric to improve upon, set a deadline, and keep track of the progress.Empower your business.

The nearest to a controversial film is Joker, which has collected flak for its portrayal of mental illness as well as its supposed apologia for incel violence.

So if you’re reading this before seeing the film, and you’ve managed to avoid the whirlwind of publicity it has attracted since winning the Palme d’Or last May, it may be simpler to just stop and head straight to the cinema. Because, at the risk of adding to the hype, Parasite really is the kind of remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going such a joy. I saw it for the fourth time last week and I’m now desperate to view the black-and-white version that Bong recently unveiled at the Rotterdam film festival.Described by its creator as “a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains”, Parasite is more Shakespearean than Hitchockian – a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, told with the trademark genre-fluidity that has seen Bong’s back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery, via monster movie, to dystopian future-fantasy and beyond. We first meet the Kim family, headed by father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), in their lowly semi-basement home, hunting for stray wifi coverage and leaving their windows open to benefit from bug-killing street fumigation. They have nothing but one another and a shared sense of hard-scrabble entrepreneurism. So when son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is faced with an unexpected opportunity to home-tutor a rich schoolgirl, he gets his gifted artist sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), to forge a college certificate, bluffing his way into the job and into the home of the Park family.An architectural wonder perched high above the slums of Seoul, with views not of urinating drunks but of luxurious lawns and starlit skies, this wealthy house is everything the Kims’ pokey dwelling is not: elegant, angular and weirdly isolated. While aloof businessman Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun) is at work, his anxious, uptight wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son. It’s a lifestyle that relies upon hired help: tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun), who stayed with the building after its original architect owner moved out. Spying an opening, Ki-woo (newly dubbed “Kevin”) realises that his own family could easily fill such roles, and hatches a plan that will inveigle the Kims into the privileged lives and home of the Parks.Beyond the deliberate ambiguity of the title (which, like Jordan Peele’s oddly comparable Us, cuts both ways), Bong once again foregrounds a distrust of wealth and authority that has been a recurrent feature of his work since his 2003 breakout Memories of Murder, continuing through films as erse as The Host, Mother, Okja and, of course, Snowpiercer, to which Parasite contains several knowing nods.The Kim family may live in sewage-flooded squalor, but they are clearly every bit as smart as, and a lot more united than, the Parks, who turn their noses up at the smell of “people who ride the subway”. Similarly, while the smug Mr Park is habitually depicted ascending the stairs of his ultra-modern home, and the Kims are pictured scampering down city steps to their own underworld apartment, it’s clear who holds the dramatic high ground.When it comes to deception, too, those on the upper rungs of the societal ladder are as practised as those upon whom they look down. In a world of vertical non-integration, Parasite finds gasp-inducing depths lurking beneath even the most apparently placid surfaces. Yet Bong is careful to keep his opposing forces keenly balanced, creating the cinematic equivalent of a Rorschach inkblot test in which the audience is invited to decide for themselves the precise meaning of these strangely symmetrical apparitions.Perfectly accompanying the film’s tonal shifts is Jung Jae-il’s magnificently modulated music, which moves from the sombre piano patterns of the curtain-raiser, through the mini symphony of The Belt of Faith to the cracked craziness of cues in which choric vocals do battle with a musical saw. Just as the action can segue from slapstick to horror and back – sometimes within the space of a single scene – so Jung plays things straight even as madness beckons, ensuring that the underlying elements of pathos are amplified rather than undercut by pastiche.For me, Parasite is best described as a melancholy ghost story, albeit one disguised beneath umpteen layers of superbly designed (and impeccably photographed) generic mutations. Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won’s multitonal script, it’s a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1bf7a082dffdeb897eea76628ea2323d1f76af3/1711_1483_2921_1752/master/2921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef902259bc64d107bfd18462bfdb6cfd","title":"forget wellness marmalade is the key to a long healthy life","story":"Since mid-January, readers have been writing in about their marmalade-making habits – and reflections on longevity.

There’s a little dish of butter on the side, as pale and soft as Mr Whippy, that will soon be speckled with the loaf’s blackened crust. A fine loaf is a good start to any dinner, but I have to admit to missing the wicker basket of rolls that used to accompany a meal in a restaurant. The plump little bubbles of dough that appeared, peeping at us from under their snow-white linen napkin. I loved digging in with my thumbs and tearing my chosen roll apart, buttering each ripped morsel in turn. And although it was rarely the best of bread, it was nevertheless all mine. A whole, fat little cherub of dough all to myself.I can’t remember the last time I was offered a bread roll in a restaurant, so this week I made my own. Two actually. One, a dark, oat-flecked rye-flour version. The other, soft and slightly oily to the touch, like focaccia, but with nuggets of sheep’s cheese.We ate the brown rolls with fillets of smoked trout and mayonnaise that was vivid green with chopped dill and parsley. The soft rolls were split and filled with crisp-fleshed winter tomatoes dressed with a mustardy olive oil and curly Turkish pickled chillies. Those we didn’t eat on the day we toasted, dipping each one into olive oil and then into a powder of crushed toasted hazelnuts, sesame, paprika and ground coriander seeds.These rolls prove more slowly than usual because of the cold kefir. Speed things up by using a warm bowl and by warming the flour in the oven for a few minutes before adding the yeast and liquid.You will also need a rectangular baking dish or bread tin, approximately 25 x 16cm. Makes 6 rollsTo finish:olive oil a littlethyme and rosemary a few sprigsPut the flour, yeast and salt in a large, warm mixing bowl. Put the kefir in a jug, add the olive oil and the warm water and stir well. Combine the kefir mixture and flour with a wooden spoon or your hands and mix until you have a soft and slightly sticky dough.Crumble the feta into a small bowl. Remove the leaves from the rosemary and thyme and finely chop them to give you 1½ tbsp, and add to the crumbled cheese.If you are making the dough by hand, tip on to a floured board and knead the cheese and herbs into it. If you prefer the easy way, use a food mixer fitted with a dough hook to knead the cheese and herbs into the dough. Continue kneading for a couple of minutes, adding a little more flour if necessary to stop it sticking, then put the dough back in its bowl, cover with a clean, warm cloth and put it in a warm place. Leave the dough in peace until it has risen to almost twice its original size.Line a deep-sided baking tin with a piece of baking parchment.Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces then shape each one into a round bun. Place the buns in the baking tin, three down each side, then return to the warm place, cover with the cloth and leave for about 30 minutes, until nicely risen and touching one another.Set the oven at 220Cgas mark 8. Toss the herbs in the olive oil and scatter them over the rolls then bake for about 20 minutes, until lightly golden brown.The dark and faintly liquorice note here makes these rolls a perfect match for smoked fish. For once, I suggest salted butter.Makes 8 rollsLine the baking or cake tin with a piece of baking parchment.Mix together the two flours, dried yeast and salt. Stir the hot water and black treacle together then combine with the flours, sunflower and pumpkin seeds and the rolled oats. When thoroughly combined, knead either by hand on a floured board or using an electric food mixer with a dough hook. The hand method will take about 6 minutes. Using a machine, just a couple of minutes on moderate speed.Transfer the bowl to a warm place, cover with a clean cloth and leave for an hour or so, until the dough has almost doubled in size.Remove the dough from the bowl and place on a lightly floured board. Add the chopped walnuts and lightly knead them into the dough. Cut the ball of dough into eight, then shape each into a ball. Place them, almost touching, in a round baking tin or cake tin about 22cm in diameter. Scatter the surface with a few oats and seeds and put in a warm place, covered by a clean cloth and leave until the rolls have risen and are touching one another.Preheat the oven to 220Cgas mark 8. Put the rolls in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes until the surface is crisp and they sound hollow when tapped. Turn out and leave to cool. (Though it has to be said they are delicious eaten warm.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91fc02d30dfcb36b0116ecf9e0c9fb657f39c9a9/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=759a3ddc40eff7a8d0584d5ba3396d96","title":"real sociedad women barcelona supercopa","story":"The coach of Real Sociedad’s women’s team has warned of the danger of Barcelona’s side getting ever more powerful after his team were hammered 10-1 by the Catalans in the first ever women’s Supercopa final on Sunday.Sociedad lifted the domestic cup last season and beat Levante 1-0 in the semi-final of the inaugural Supercopa, while Barça, last year’s league runners-up, defeated league champions Atlético Madrid.But there was an evident gulf in class in Sunday’s showpiece in front of 9,000 fans at the Helmántico stadium, as Marta Torrejón scored four goals while Alexia Putellas and Nigerian international Asisat Oshoala each scored two.“Every team feels that we cannot compete with this Barca side,” Sociedad coach Gonzalo Arconada told a news conference. “The federation must decide if this is what they wanted. Barca were always going to win the game and we had to suffer this humiliation.”Barça are on course to end a five-year wait to be crowned Spanish champions as they hold a nine-point lead over nearest challengers Atlético after 18 games, of which they have won 16 and drawn two while scoring 68 goals.They reached the final of the Champions League for the first time in May, losing to Olympique Lyonnais, but bolstered their squad in the close season by signing Norway international Caroline Graham Hansen, who was also on target in the Supercopa final.The double-figure victory over Sociedad followed other big wins for Barca this season, including 9-1 and 6-0 wins over CD Tacón, the club that will be absorbed by Real Madrid next season.“Their budget is much bigger than everyone else’s,” said Arconada, “and the federation must decide if they want them to humiliate the other teams like this.”Barcelona coach Lluís Cortés responded by saying: “Each club invests in women’s football as much as they want to and the percentage in relation to the spending on the men’s team is very small. I wish we could always win 10-1, but I am sure this won’t happen when we meet next in the league.

Here she talks about shattering stereotypes and using fashion as a force for changeHalima Aden, then aged 19, became the first contestant in the Miss USA 2016 beauty pageant to wear a hijab and burkini, attracting the attention of French fashion legend Carine Roitfeld. The following year she became the first hijab-wearing model to sign with a global modelling agency, IMG, and then the first to walk at New York fashion week, for Yeezy, the Kanye West brand. She later became the first hijab-wearing model to make the cover of Vogue – twice (first Vogue Arabia, then British Vogue) – and soon afterwards a Sports Illustrated swimsuit shoot followed. By that point she’d already become a Unicef ambassador, and a go-to voice on ersity in the fashion industry. In 2017 she gave the first TED talk at a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya. Teen Vogue went with her.When we meet, at a hotel near King’s Cross, I ask if it ever gets tiring, being the first in so many different ways, shouldering the burden of representation. “Somebody needs to,” Aden says. “I want my sister, my little nieces, even my nephews to see representations of somebody who wears a hijab in modern ways, in such a way that they can relate to.” We’re sitting side by side on a window seat, Aden holding court before a little audience of PRs, management and her best friend, Lizeth, who has travelled with her from the US. Though she looks very much the high-fashion figure, all in black – sequins and brocade lace, knee-high stiletto boots – she seems younger than her 22 years, gabbing away in the stream-of-conscious slang and asides of a teenager still starstruck by the turns her life has taken.But on the topics of ersity, representation and sustainability, she speaks with passion and conviction. She has said in the past that, growing up in the US: “The only times I saw somebody dressed like me was on CNN – and they weren’t doing anything I approve of.”“I feel like we all deserve representation and I didn’t have that,” Aden says now. “I never got to flip through a magazine and see somebody who looks like me.” Lizeth digs out the latest issue of Essence magazine, Aden proud in pink on the cover. Aden takes it from her, somewhat wonderingly. “Sometimes it’s so wild for me,” she says. “I still catch myself… When my friend went and got that from the newsstand, I was like: ‘Oh my God.’”The fact she has been able to have a global career in fashion at all is proof that the industry is increasingly open to ersity. Aden is 5ft 5in, petite for a model, and a resident of Minnesota, far from the industry capitals of New York, London, Paris or Milan. “And the fact that I’m able to do runway, the fact that I have graced these magazine covers and wear a hijab on top of that, be who I am, have my identity, wear it proudly… I think fashion is doing a beautiful job.”She does have certain requirements, such as a pop-up tent in which to change backstage at shows, but she says she’s never been uncomfortably set apart, or made to feel othered. She remembers her experience of walking for Yeezy at New York fashion week in 2017, her breakout year, as a watershed moment. The first outfit she was presented with “was just not going to work,” she says, gesturing above her knee – too short. “Even then I knew: walking away when something doesn’t fit is always better than feeling you need to force something.”She returned to her hotel, disappointed but resolute. “And then, without having to say anything, they called back: ‘We have a second option.’ I tried it on and it was perfect. I just knew it was a pivotal moment in my life. The people who you want to work with, they’re willing to work with you just the way you are.”That same year, Aden remembers walking for MaxMara at Milan fashion week in a look that had been designed with her in mind. When she posted it on Instagram, a woman commented: “He keeps you in mind, he keeps us in mind. Now this Muslim shopper will keep MaxMara in mind.” Aden shared it with the brand. “I was like – wink-wink-wink!”It led to an exclusive capsule collection in the Middle East, for which Aden was the face. “It’s a win for designers when they’re erse it’s a win for the brand, it’s a win for everybody – we all want to see a little piece of ourselves reflecting back.” And it makes a difference, she says. The year after Aden became the first contestant to wear a hijab in Miss USA, there were seven others. Last year she was one of two hijabi models on the MaxMara catwalk in Milan, and one of three for her second Vogue Arabia cover.When Aden was seven, she used to pray for rain – the kind of torrential rain that would wash away her new home in the American Midwest. “I remember thinking: ‘Then our neighbours could come out and play,’” she says. Even the structure of her apartment building felt alienating. “I was like, ‘God, everybody is so isolated.’”Aden was born a refugee in the United Nations Kakuma camp in northwestern Kenya, where her mother had fled the Somali civil war in 1994. There their house was made of mud, scraps, sticks – anything her mother could find. “It would be normal for me to go to nursery school, come back and find it had washed away,” she says. But then the community would come together to rebuild it, “and then it’s the kids’ time to play around.”The model remembers her childhood in the camp as being joyful and supportive. “There’s no walls keeping you apart from your neighbour,” she says. In her new home in Missouri, where she was relocated with her family in 2004, before moving to Minnesota, where they live today, the barriers stood strong.As a child, Aden remembers thriving under the collective care of the community, which was two thirds women and children. She was bright – she spoke Somali and Swahili, sometimes translating for the grown-ups – and popular, roaming the camp with up to 30 playmates of mixed ages and ethnicities. (“If you could keep up, you were in the group.”)Aden is well aware that her happy stories of childhood challenge the stereotype of the “tragic refugee”, though she credits her mother with working hard to shield her young family from hardship. Aden never knew her father. He was lost during the Somali civil war, and assumed dead by her mother he made contact after they had moved to the US, but died before Aden could develop a relationship. “It was both the scars and the smiles,” she says. “It was a happy childhood and also, we lived in uncertainty.”Symbolic of this limbo was a noticeboard that was updated with the names and destinations of those lucky few bound for resettlement. Aden remembers it as larger than life, “like something out of The Hunger Games”: “It would control your entire future – it was literally the difference between life and death. For parents it meant a brand new life: ‘We’re starting over, we won the lottery.’ But for the kids it is: ‘I’m never seeing my friends again’.”Another common misconception of being a refugee, Aden says, “is that you get a say where you go”. Her family were relocated to a poverty-stricken, crime-rife neighbourhood in St Louis, Missouri, which – compared to the “nurturing” community of Kakuma – came as a shock. That was when she felt most isolated, when she wished for her house to wash away. It was the first time she’d heard gunshots. “But nonetheless, did I have the fear of malaria? No – so, in a way, it was like trading one obstacle for another.”The biggest hurdle was learning English: Aden’s school in St Louis did not have an English language programme. After two weeks of presenteeism, Aden recalls her mother asking her to read some written English aloud. “I literally started mouthing the words to Dilemma” – rapper Nelly and Kelly Rowland’s syrupy duet, which she knew from the radio. Aden mimics a haltering recital: “‘No matt-er. Whatido. All I think about. Is you’ – I just couldn’t stand the idea of disappointing her.”Eventually Aden’s mother decided to relocate the family to St Cloud, Minnesota, where they found a community like the one that they had left at the camp. At first they were heavily reliant on it, living on food stamps and even, for six months, in a women’s shelter. Aden remembers the kindness of neighbours, taking the family to the grocery store during the punishing winters, giving her mother lifts when she couldn’t drive. “It’s why I’m so loyal,” she says. “I love my state.” She lives in St Paul now, closer to the airport, but only 40 minutes from her mother, who’s still in St Cloud. Minnesota is known for high taxes, but Aden says she is happy to pay them. “I relied on welfare when I was little... I think of it as my way of paying back.”Before we meet, Aden’s team is adamant that I don’t ask her about Trump or US politics, so instead I ask her how superficial ersity in fashion tallies with a more fractious, ided world.“I don’t even really avoid politics,” she says, “but it’s not something that I’ve needed in order to connect with people. Once I share my story, there’s always some common ground. It doesn’t have to be: ‘I grew up in a refugee camp.’ I get just as many messages, believe it or not, from parents who are not Muslim, who are not black, who say, ‘Thank you for making modesty look cool and young’.”When she entered the Miss Minnesota USA pageant in 2016, as a freshman at St Cloud State University, Aden told local media that she wanted to represent Muslim women and counter the image that they were oppressed. “The hijab is a symbol we wear on our heads,” she said. “But I want people to know that it is my choice.” Today she says her motivations for entering were less lofty. “College tuition is expensive in the States, muuuuuucho expensive!” And the top 15 at the pageant were offered scholarships. Did Aden think she’d win? “No, God, no.” She laughs. “But top 15? I was like, ‘I think I could do that’.”Aden’s mother was strongly against her entering the pageant, arguing it would distract from her studies, and that the two-piece burkini was too skimpy. Though they have since been able to find common ground through her advocacy and work with Unicef, it can feel like they are from two different cultures sometimes. She didn’t tell her mum about the Sports Illustrated shoot “until it hit newsstands”.She was also criticised by members of the Muslim community who saw modelling as haram – forbidden by Islamic law. “It was scary to put myself out there, because I didn’t know if I would get backlash, or how bad it was going to be,” she says. Two days before the pageant, Aden almost pulled out. But as she told the newspaper at the time: “You don’t let being the first to do it stop you.”She ended up making the semi-finals, “braces and all. And then IMG came calling – like, ‘Well, well, well… maybe I don’t need school.’” She leans back, for a second jokily triumphant – then seems to feel a chill coming in from across the Atlantic. “I’m kidding. Sorry, Mom!”The global spotlight on Aden caught the eye of Carine Roitfeld, who flew her to New York to shoot the cover of CR Fashion Book with Gigi Hadid, Paris Jackson and legendary photographer Mario Sorrenti. Aden agonised about asking for a selfie with Gigi (“So cringy,” she says now). As for Sorrenti, though, she had to Google her later.His direction to her was, “Give me sexy”, she seems a little abashed to say. “I didn’t know fashion lingo, I didn’t know photographers. I’m a Minnesota girl – very small town.” Even after signing with IMG, she watched all of Tyra Banks’s outlandish reality series America’s Next Top Model “to practise”. Seven months into her modelling career, she was still working part-time as a housekeeper in St Cloud.But rather than asking Aden to change, fashion’s royalty has made room for her as she is. Last week she was back in Kenya for a shoot and “I was just thinking, how crazy is it that, in one lifetime, I’ve gotten to experience both extremes.” Aden says she does not feel angry about the inequality she has seen – partly because she does not find it to be productive. “It’s like when I say: ‘We don’t want your pity.’ Let’s talk about solutions, invite refugees to the table. They’re part of the conversation – no policies should be enacted without their say.”Though she rules out a career in politics (“for now”), in the future she hopes to return to Kakuma with Unicef to inspire hope within the camp for a new life beyond it. “I couldn’t tell you what that would have meant to me as a six or seven-year-old – like, ‘Wait, there’s a life outside these walls?’ Hopefully, it’s not going to be so rare to see kids from the camps grow up and become teachers, lawmakers, presidents and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. There’s talent everywhere.”For now Aden is pursuing opportunities in “fashion activism”. This month she was announced as the new face of the British accessories brand Bottletop, which was ahead of its time in positioning itself as “sustainable luxury” in 2002. Its handbags and clutches, which are made from sustainable leather and upcycled metal ring pulls, help to alleviate poverty in Brazil, Nepal and Kenya. Aden is optimistic in general, but particularly about the potential for consumer choice to be a force for positive change: “I think we’re at a place where people want to support brands and organisations they know are giving back.” She is also an ambassador for Bottletop’s #Togetherband campaign, which is tasked with raising awareness of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Aden is probably one of the few celebrities who can “relate personally” to all 17 of them. She has been assigned the eighth goal: “Decent work and economic growth.” The fact that the Swiss multinational bank UBS is a founding partner seems to suggest which way the wind is blowing.“My career in fashion is not just, ‘I want to work with this brand, I want to get on that catwalk’ – we’re not sitting here talking about ‘Buy this heel, because this heel will make you feel sexy.’” She kicks up her stiletto boot, knee-high in black patent leather (admittedly very sexy). “I’m proud that I can say I combined fashion and activism. I can’t do one without the other.”Aden sees that her story, from refugee camp to the cover of Vogue, is an unusual one. But she has had to navigate it herself – down to mentioning, at her very first meeting with IMG as a teenager in New York, that she would like to work with Unicef. “I had to learn, in the beginning especially, that maybe I’d never find another model who I could relate to.

So,  Rebecca Nicholson decided to tryLike most people I know, my Weekly Screen Report is obscene. Every Sunday, when the notification pops up to tell me the hours I have wasted, mostly texting, I think about all the things I could have done. Finished Middlemarch. Started Middlemarch. But as I have my phone in my hand, I scroll through Instagram instead. I send an article or a joke to a friend, a picture of the dog to the family WhatsApp, catch up on someone else’s night out. Recently, I clocked up – and I’m ashamed as I write this – six hours and 29 minutes of phone usage in a single day. I have had days where I’ve barely been awake that long. Messages is my most used app. I am talking all the time.I know many will welcome this as a kind of freedom. The very idea of talking on the phone invokes horror among those who claim to loathe it. There are thousands of memes explaining the many ways that talking, not texting, is rude, basically criminal. Calling is not time-efficient, ill-suited to the attention economy, where all eyes must be on several screens at once. You can send messages when you’re doing something else – watching The Irishman, or having a bath, or even talking to another person in real life. My dad recently marvelled at me being able to text with two thumbs I marvel at teenagers being able to text while talking to you and not looking at the screen. Once technology gave us the ability to easily screen calls, we ran with it. We can ignore the relative who phones with a list of recent hometown tragedies, the work call we don’t feel like taking, our chattiest of friends who might not let us go for an hour. But what happens if you are that chatty friend?Smart phones are smart enough to tell you that you’re using them too much. The dumb phone is making a comeback. I wondered if it was possible to ride this wave of the digital detox and make a deliberate effort to call instead of text. I wanted to see if it would change my relationships, particularly the ones I had grown lazy about maintaining. The plan was to stay off text and DMs for a solid month. I was fed up of paddling in the shallows. I wanted to swim. If I needed to speak to someone, I’d have to call them.When the writer Elizabeth Wurtzel died in January, a piece she wrote in 2013, about her “one-night stand of a life”, began to circulate again, and it contained one paragraph that hit me particularly hard. “Look at how we live,” she wrote. “We communicate in text messages and emails even those of us old enough to have lived in a world where landline was not a word because it’s all there was have fallen into this lazy substitute for human contact. I have.”Who hasn’t? It should be easier than ever to talk. There are limitless outlets for publishing our thoughts, endless ways to begin a kind of conversation. Voice memos are popular, particularly among young people, but they’re a halfway house, still one-sided. We talk with one eye on efficiency, and it strangles what is so good about it – the spontaneity, the lack of ability to control what happens when two people are rambling on to each other.The psychologist Sherry Turkle has been studying the impact of computers on human psychology since the early 1980s, and in 2015 she published Reclaiming Conversation, in which she referred to “the edited life” that we live now. She spoke to teachers who observed that their students seemed to develop empathetic skills at a slower rate than they would be expected to. “Face-to-face conversation is the most human – and humanising – thing we do,” she wrote. “Fully present to one another, we learn to listen. It’s where we develop the capacity for empathy. It’s where we experience the joy of being heard, of being understood.”Are we losing that joy of being heard? Most offices are quieter places than they have ever been. The open-plan rooms I have worked in over the last decade or so are filled with people wearing headphones, silently tapping away on Gchat or Slack. Even workplaces that should invite conversation are making it easier to avoid talking at all. If you stay in a budget hotel, you can check yourself in and out. If you scan your onions on the supermarket’s self- service checkout, you don’t need to chat about what you’re planning to do with them. When it was common enough to be considered a problem, making a phone call on public transport used to be frowned upon. In the early 00s, Dom Joly built a TV career out of shouting “Hello!” into an oversized mobile in public places. Train carriages are now full of heads bowed, illuminated by blue light. A few years ago the Daily Mash ran a much-shared satirical news story: “A northern man has left a trail of terror across London by attempting to interact socially with everyone he meets.” And even in the north, screens have begun to dominate. Quiet carriages are becoming redundant. We are making ourselves quiet.In 2014, someone set up a family WhatsApp group. Before then, I spoke to my family on the phone all the time. Now, we spend more time in touch with each other than ever before, yet I miss them. It’s a noticeboard, more than a conversation. The person I still speak to most often, and for longest, is my nan, who is 83. She has a mobile, but doesn’t text. The other day I phoned to see how she was, and she told me a long story about how she was never supposed to have the name that she has, but there were 23 pubs in the village she was born in, and her father stopped in at most of them on the way to register her birth. By the time he got to the clerk, he’d forgotten what he’d been told to call her, so he named her after the clerk instead.Verbal conversations are unpredictable and unwieldy in a way that those written down are not, because when we type or tap, we are in control, of our side, at least. This ruthless chat efficiency has excised the flab but, I realise, I love the flab. It’s where the excitement happens. I wanted to revive those conversations with everyone. So in my month of no texts, the WhatsApp group would be the first thing to go. I went to delete the app, pressed my finger on the screen, let it wobble – and then I stopped. There was a video of my niece dancing in front of the TV that I wanted to show my partner and I thought, I can just look at the photos and videos, every now and then. Can’t I?Dr Scott Wark is a research associate at Warwick University who studies culture, technology and social media his PhD thesis was about memes. I called him to see if we are actually moving away from verbal communication. He was in Chile for work, and I couldn’t get through until I emailed to check he was there. But when we finally managed it, he was more optimistic than I had anticipated.He does believe that people are less willing to make calls. “It feels like more of an imposition. If I want to talk to my boss, we schedule a time to make a call. She doesn’t just call.” He points out that social media gives us far more control over a chat. “Even though there’s an idea that everyone’s addicted to social media and constantly checking updates, you can ignore a notification of a message. If I’m chatting to a friend in Australia, and I stop responding to her, I’ve probably just gone to sleep and I’ll pick it up the next day. It’s a continuous conversation that doesn’t interrupt anything and is parallel to whatever else we’re both doing.”Wark disputes the idea that we are becoming more disconnected he says it’s important to make a distinction between disconnection and distraction. If people are becoming more mindful about their phone usage, though, does he think calling might make a comeback?“What people are responding to, with the idea of a ‘digital detox’, is this overload of distractions. That is a huge problem, because there are all these demands on our cognitive capacity and that’s overwhelming, and exhausting. We’re spread thin.”It’s good to know we’re all at it. There is a running joke in my house that if the phone rings after 7pm, without a text to warn that a call is coming, one of us has to say, “Who’s dead now?” It’s not ha-ha funny, but it speaks volumes about what the once humble phone call has come to mean. I thought it was just us, that we’d developed gallows humour after a year of the kind of calls that drain the blood from the body, that in saying the worst out loud, it somehow would ward off more bad news.Wark said that he, too, thinks the worst if he has an unexpected missed call. When I talked to my friends about it, I realised that most people feel the same way. A phone call, out of the blue, is alarming. It’s a harbinger of doom, its ringtone a tiny scythe. The first thing I say when I answer the phone is usually, “What’s wrong?”On the first day of not texting for a month, a friend had some bad news about her health. I wanted to know how she was. But I thought calling would alarm her, because it has become alarming. So I texted, and we had a text chat, while the telly was on. Calling really would have felt like an imposition. I thought I’d call my girlfriend to see what she fancied for dinner, but she was on the tube, and the missed call made her worried that something had happened, so we ended up texting about that, too. My month of not texting was barely even a day old. I failed completely.I am wary of nostalgia. Nobody wants to hear another old person chirping that it was better in their day. When I spoke to Dr Wark, he sounded hopeful about the changing nature of communication. “I’m 31, and I’ve been chatting to people online since I was nine. Talking to people on text is totally naturalised,” he says. “Younger people are more willing to FaceTime one another now, and be watching TV, without really saying anything, just hanging out. There’s a different kind of presence involved.” There’s an argument that all this texting facilitates people meeting up in real life anyway, he says, and research to back that up. We may be more distracted than before, but we are more connected. I ask Wark if he’s a texter or a caller himself. It depends, he says, on the person, and his relationship to them. He calls his mum, he texts his partner. “But personally, I would prefer to meet my friends and just talk to them in a pub.”I could not stop texting, but in the search for a better connection, I did start to call more. I started to phone to cancel plans, and it proved a good litmus test: having to talk about it made me consider whether I genuinely wanted to cancel, or whether I was just being idle. I phoned a friend to say that, honestly, I couldn’t be bothered to travel for 45 minutes to see a film I wasn’t interested in and he said that, honestly, neither could he. We talked for half an hour. My girlfriend is often away for work and it’s become clear that talking on the phone once every couple of days is more substantial and infinitely nicer than constant texting about humdrum stuff.On the Failed Day of No Texts, it became horribly apparent just how compelled I was to share every little detail of what was happening to me. I dropped a plate, and went to tell someone about it, anyone. But to realise I might have to call someone to tell them I was clumsy, which they already knew, made it seem totally redundant. I felt free, somehow, from the obligation to transmit the boring bits of my life as rolling news. By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are almost always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face, they’re even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. It is much more difficult to be rude, and we could all use a bit of that.Talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned, scheduled, and to call is to really mean it. I still text, all the time. I feel inordinately proud of myself if my screen time drops below three hours a day. But I am calling more, too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two-sided and flexible and unpredictable. I just send a text to say I’m going to call first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70a24d09e4578593f4113997f6ad068af1a8f39e/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=722139c5cdcf82ac03b82d883419083b","title":"five ways to be a better partner","story":"Sarah Calvert, a relationship therapist in London, says: “Starting from a place of appreciation is always of benefit, and can help solve more difficult conversations. It’s easy to focus on what is lacking, so I invite people to think about what they appreciate about the other person on a daily basis. Find one thing each day and tell them.” This could be anything from something they do, or a quality that they have to the way they are looking. “Actively seeking out things to appreciate helps them feel valued,” says Calvert, and when your partner better understands what you appreciate about them, they’ll probably start doing those things a bit more.“This is the person you have chosen, and they are who they are. You can’t change somebody else,” says Dee Holmes, a senior practice consultant for Relate. This can even come down to not sweating the small stuff. “We all do things that irritate our partners,” says Holmes. “Does this really need addressing or should you accept that’s just what they do?” Respect and celebrate each other’s iniduality. While couple time is important, says Holmes, “you’ve got to allow someone that space to still see their friends and do their own things”. After all, if you stopped them from pursuing their interests and doing all those things that makes them them, she warns, “they’re not going to be the person you got together with”.“It can be quite easy to not say the obvious things, because you assume the other person knows,” says Holmes. It can be just as easy to erroneously assume you understand them. If your partner says they don’t want to go out tonight after all, says Holmes, you might feel cheated by their backtracking, without considering what caused their change of heart. Perhaps something is troubling them. Try some active listening, suggests Calvert. “Make an effort to be fully present, and really learn what is going on for that person, rather than just hearing the words.”“Some people feel loved through their partner’s actions, anything from bringing a cup of tea for them in bed to upgrading their technology,” says Calvert. Some need affirming words, to be told that they’re loved. For others, physical contact is more significant: intimacy, sex, holding hands. Maybe it’s quality time, with your full attention, or perhaps gifts hold greater meaning for your partner. “If they think that what really matters is holding hands in public,” says Calvert, “and you’re just saying to them, ‘I love you,’ but not giving them any physical contact, then they’re not going to feel so loved.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073a1a4ecc6bfc95b9bb3fc67b4cca20c3e0d6e4/0_343_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9110e099c4e263d91c8b9fc40ec95c72","title":"how to be a better kisser","story":"Kissing can be a way to confirm your attraction to someone, but don’t ever feel obliged to kiss someone.

Some people complain about those who stick their tongues in too soon. This could be seen as a kissing “don’t”, but there are no rules when it comes to style it’s horses for courses and more about exploring and reading the signs.Couples often complain that they don’t kiss any more. People are busy sometimes there’s a fear that a kiss has to lead to sex, but it doesn’t. Think about what you want to convey in a kiss. “I want to invite my partner in, I want some connection, I want some of the ‘love hormone’ oxytocin.” Or, “I’m looking at you and appreciating you and want to show you that.” Consider what you might be saying to your partner by not kissing them.I advocate investing in a 20-second kiss. It might feel clunky at first, but it can re-establish the connection, almost revisit that first date. Kissing is extremely sensual. There’s taste, touch, smell. Try opening your eyes for a moment, too. Again, it may feel awkward at first, but afterwards people often say: “Actually, it was really nice.

Take a lesson from a sleepy dormouse…I sometimes think that winter doesn’t truly start until February. Once the final sunny moments of autumn have gone, I’m bounced along by preparations for the festive season. Even after the final New Year corks have popped, my own reforming zeal gets me through. I may not be tempted by dry Januaries, diets and punishing exercise regimes, but I’m always a sucker for a fresh start, for plans drawn up on new stationery and commitments made to improve myself.But by early February, I’m sagging. Tired, hungry and sick of the dark, my motivation has run out, my bank account is empty and the world feels soggy underfoot. I start to skip my yoga class and social invitations feel like an imposition. The urge to pull the duvet over my head becomes very strong indeed.Humans cannot actually hibernate, but in the coldest months of the year, many of us are drawn to something similar. We want to batten down the hatches against the treacherous weather outside, preserve our energies, lay on fat. If only we could suspend the demands of life, just until the sun comes out again, all would be well.Is it such a bad thing, this desire to hibernate until spring? After all, it feels like a natural response: winter simply demands that we slow down rather than drop out altogether – why can’t we find a way to do this?I recently visited hibernating dormice at Wildwood Trust just outside Canterbury. Dormice are one of only three UK mammals to hibernate (alongside hedgehogs and bats) and they do so for half of each year, retreating to their nests with the first frosts in October or November, and only emerging when food is abundant again in April or May. In late summer they gorge on fruit, storing the energy as easily accessible liquid fat just beneath the skin. As I learned when I held one – a perfect ball of amber fur rolling in my palm like a marble – you can leave fingerprints in a sleeping dormouse.To get through this long period without food, a dormouse will slow down its metabolism to the extent that it consumes almost no energy at all, waking briefly every 10 days to keep its organs in working order. We humans, having a few more worldly commitments and physical limitations than your average dormouse, are unable to do the same, but we can allow winter to modify the rhythms of our lives.Everything about me changes in winter – and I let it happen. Winter is a time to enjoy the pleasures of solitude, to dream and contemplate. It opens up a space in which I can mass my energies, to restore and repair. I want to eat cooked food instead of raw, comforting carbs over fresh flavours. I want to revisit beloved old films and spend time pottering in the company of the radio. Gone are the splashy novels of summer winter urges me towards thoughtful, ambulatory reading, chewed over in lamplight. In winter, I can spend hours in silent pursuit of a half-understood concept, or a detail of history. Winter has patience. There is nowhere else to be, after all.While summer often wakes me at 4am with dawn, in winter I can sleep for hours, surrendering to my bed shortly after 9pm, and drowsing there until my morning alarm. Our recent ancestors would have known this pattern well after all, electric light has only been with us for just over a century. Before that the winter nights were very long indeed.Sleepy as I am in winter, I find that I rarely slumber right through. Instead, I often wake in the middle of the night and spend an hour or two mulling over my thoughts, sometimes getting up to read, write or meditate, before returning to my bed to sleep until morning. I used to worry over these moments, considering them to be insomnia, but A Roger Ekirch’s book, At Day’s Close: a History of Nighttime, convinced me otherwise. Waking in the midst of a long winter night is, he argues, a form of sleep that would have been entirely normal before light was at our command. Nights were ided into a first and second sleep, with a “watch” in between, during which people would pray, reflect, make love or indulge in quiet conversation with family. It was an intimate time, so private and mundane that it barely merited a mention.A 1996 study by Thomas Wehr and colleagues suggests that we could fall back into this pattern given the right conditions. Wehr deprived his subjects of artificial light for 14 hours at a time in an attempt to replicate the prehistoric night. After several weeks, the participants fell into a routine of lying awake in bed for two hours before falling asleep for around four hours. They would then wake up and enjoy two or three hours of time that was characterised as contemplative and restful, and then take another four hours of sleep until morning. Most interesting of all, Wehr observed that the midnight watch was far from an anxious time for his subjects. They felt calm and reflective in these moments, and Wehr found that they had elevated levels of prolactin in their blood, a hormone more usually found in nursing mothers. It usually stimulates milk production, but in this context it seems to produce feelings of contentment and calmness. Wehr suggested that the watch was a unique state of consciousness with an “endocrinology all of its own”. Waking during this natural break in sleep seems to release a cocktail of hormones that isn’t found at any other point in our existence.Is this, then, our human version of hibernation: a thoughtful mode of being that’s profoundly restorative, brought about by the conditions of winter? Perhaps, but I prefer to see hibernation as a useful analogy rather than a biological imperative – after all, winter only comes to populations who live far from the equator wintering is not a universal human experience.We also need to understand the healthy limits of our urge to hide away in winter. In regions where solitude is forced upon communities through impenetrable weather, careful preparations are made to ensure that life remains stimulating and joyful during the dark months. Hygge may have been a lifestyle trend in the UK, but closer to the Arctic Circle, those cosy candles and comfort foods are tools of self-preservation. In Nordic countries, it’s common to stock the freezer with cakes and pastries over winter, ready to offer hospitality to anyone who comes to the door. The sauna is one of the ways that Finnish people battle against the cold. It is a place of refuge and a place that brings a sense of conviviality during periods of isolation. Chosen or not, our periods of hibernation need to be punctuated with moments of social contact, or else we unravel.I’ve learned to find my own way through winter though. I also seek moments of light and heat to keep my spirits high. In recent years, I’ve developed the (admittedly slightly eccentric) habit of retrieving discarded Christmas trees and squirrelling them in my back garden to light a series of spectacular, resinous bonfires on the darkest nights.I’ve learned to seek out some of the older winter festivals, too, which mark the beats of the season until the coming of spring. In January I attend one of Kent’s growing number of wassails, a half-pagan, half-Christian ceremony in which an apple tree is fed a tribute of cider to encourage a good harvest later in the year. And I pause on 1 February to mark Imbolc, the Gaelic festival that marks the start of spring, when the ewes are pregnant and the first snowdrops are appearing.Perhaps we can actually learn more from badgers and frogs than we can from dormice. Instead of hibernating, they fall into states of torpor for short periods of time when food is scarce.

Now increasing numbers of owners are being taken by their pets for a vigorous run instead.Although canicross – where a human is strapped with a bungee cord to a dog in a harness as it races across fields and woodland trails – has been slowly growing in popularity, there has been a huge jump in participation in the last 12 months. Demand across the UK for equipment has quadrupled, while for training classes it has nearly tripled. Record numbers are also signing up to running events that allow dogs.In response, a plethora of canicross training companies have sprung up, offering to teach joggers how to direct their dogs while running and ensure the pet’s pace is appropriate for its age and fitness level.At DogFit, around 4,000 people have taken part in training classes over the past year alone, which is 2,500 more than last year. “Participation is at record levels,” says co-founder Gail Walker. She estimates that over the same period sales of her canicross equipment kits have quadrupled. “At Christmas we were inundated,” she said.“It’s definitely been the busiest year for canicross equipment that we’ve seen,” says Adrian Ward, owner of Innerwolf, a website which sells canicross harnesses for dogs, waist belts for humans and leads made from bungee cords, to protect dog and owner from sudden changes in speed or direction.He has seen demand “at least double” over the past year, he says. “It’s exposure, I suppose. More people are hearing about it and, because most trail running events now incorporate a canicross category, there is more availability at races now as well.”Mark Tasker, a dog trainer at the Dog Academy in Hertfordshire, decided to start offering canicross taster classes last month after requests from his clients. “The first session was sold out and the next one is sold out too. Customers are looking for extra things to do with their dog,” he says.Canicross appeals because dog owners like the idea of getting fit while strengthening their bond with their pet, he adds. “Plus, if you run with your dog, you are learning a new skill, and actually, it’s easier than running on your own because you’re working as a team.”At Cani-Fit, another canicross training company, founder Lindsay Johnson says her clients and their dogs particularly enjoy the social aspect of the weekly hour-long training runs. “We get a lot of people who wouldn’t attend a gym or a running club. They use the dog as a crutch –they tell themselves they are doing it for the dog. As for the dogs, they love running with other dogs.”It’s a great way, she says, for nervous dogs in particular to safely socialise with other dogs. “When they all face the same direction, there doesn’t tend to be any intimidation.”Since it is best for dogs to run long distances on surfaces which are naturally bouncy and kind to their paws, canicross runs typically take place on trails, rather than pavements. “When you’re running the types of trails we do, you’re going on a real adventure,” says Johnson. “You’re running off-piste, through woods and streams, over fallen trees. It’s like going back to your childhood days, when you’re out playing in the woods, but you get to do it with your dog.”To run along such trails together, owners must work with their dogs. “You achieve a different level of understanding each other because you’re having to pick up on different senses, touch and positions. You get such a stronger bond, and such a sense of achievement with your dog,” she adds.One of the reasons canicross has become so popular so quickly is because it has a high retention rate, Walker says. “Once people go to a class, most people will continue with it.” She is particularly keen to stress the impact canicross has had on some of her runners with mental health issues. “They say it’s been really good for them because they’re running outside, they’re meeting people and they’re doing all that with their dog, their best friend. I’ve been told some lovely, heartwarming stories.”She will never forget the first time she tried canicross herself. “It was just exhilarating. You get a little pull from your dog, which you can control using commands, but it feels like you are running with dogs in a pack. They’re excited, they’re enjoying it, and you feed off them. It puts the fun back into serious running.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92307488ce26519ffc895275770aebc7f38807b1/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a31bba8c04ce44054b4cc79e6a7af88","title":"back to the bush three recovering nsw regions eager for visitors","story":"After months of fear and cancelled visits, some fire-impacted regions in New South Wales have reopened for business – and still make a lovely holiday destinationOver the Christmas and New Year’s break thousands of holidaymakers were forced to evacuate coastal regions in Victoria and on the New South Wales south coast. The advice from fire authorities was firm: “If you don’t need to be here, leave now.”Soon after, the message flipped. “We need you here, come back!” was the call, as towns reliant on tourism, especially from peak times such as the summer school holidays, suffered an avalanche of cancellations.Yet with landscapes scorched and fires still flaring up, the reality of rebooking is muddied by concerns. Is it safe? Are roads open? Are power lines functional, supermarkets stocked and beaches clean? Are national parks open? Moreover, will it be a nice time?We talked to four bushfire-affected regions and discovered that in most cases the answer is yes. While itineraries may need tweaking and you should certainly call in advance, the Blue Mountains, the Hawkesbury and large parts of the NSW south coast are indeed open for business, with many spots not affected even at the height of the crisis.The National Parks and Wildlife Service is still recommending people avoid remote areas. While parks are progressively reopening, a closed park means your safety can’t be guaranteed and some are still being assessed after recent fires or still managing active blazes. The maximum penalty for entering a closed park is a fine of $3,300. And yes, it’s enforceable.Check NPWS alerts for closures and fire bans and read the safety tips. Current NSW fires are updated on the Rural Fire Service website, the bushfire information line (1800 679 737) or the Fires Near Me app. Check roads on livetraffic.The Shoalhaven area takes in 170km of coastline from Kangaroo Valley in the north to Pebbly Beach in the south, via 49 towns and 100 beaches – many enclosed by bush that thrums with insect drone and rustles with birds.Shoalhaven’s major tourist towns of Berry, Jervis Bay, Mollymook and Ulladulla are fully operational yet uncannily quiet. The lull means visitors can book beds at places such as glamping pioneer Paperbark Camp, which usually fills up six months in advance.Five minutes from Mollymook Beach is Cupitt’s Estate winery. Overlooking Burrill Lake, it has a cellar door, a fromagerie, a brewery, an excellent kitchen and Sunday music sessions. It’s just one of several wineries close to beaches around Berry and Shoalhaven Heads with multiple wine-and-swim combinations possible.From Sydney, you can drive the 90 minutes to Berry through the windy countryside of Kangaroo Valley or directly to Seven Mile Beach national park with accommodation in Gerroa, Nowra or Jaspers Brush. Alternatively, the Keep On Camping website displays which caravan parks and campground are open around Australia.Further south, the new Jervis Bay Brewing Company is one of many businesses feeling the pinch of a slow summer. “The locals are out as much as they can be but their pockets are only so deep – they’re also hurting,” says co-owner Paul Walker. The company is currently in a precarious position – they’d banked on visitors over the Christmas period and now, “because we didn’t get that trade we are now in a position where we don’t have enough money to make or can more beer”.Walker is thankful his area was spared the worst of the fires, saying “we dodged a bullet, big time,” but now he says “the whole area is screaming for people to come back”.If you take his invitation, dolphin tours and fishing trips will be at your fingertips. As will Booderee Botanic Gardens, Australia’s only Aboriginal-owned botanic gardens, with guided walks available. Or head further south to Pebbly Beach in Murramarang national park, to see surfers, sea eagles and kangaroos in a single beach outing.From Bilpin, travel through Mount Victoria, home of the historic Mount Vic Flicks cinema, to Blackheath. Many lookouts and walks in the Blue Mountains national park are open again. On the wheelchair-friendly Fairfax Heritage track “you’ll see fire regeneration at its best”, says a NPWS spokesperson, including “lovely bright-coloured shoots re-emerging on the blackened trees”.Katoomba, meanwhile, offers antiques, cocktails, record shopping and an abundance of outdoors shops and cafes. Mr Pickwick’s Fine Old Books is a treasure trove of vintage delights, or pop by new business Steep St for a mash-up of immaculately sourced loose-leaf tea, ancient remedies, plants, art and vintage synthesisers.Halfway between Sydney and Melbourne, the sapphire coast brims with national parks, lagoons, rivers, fishing and delectable seafood. Its main coastal towns of Bermagui, Tathra, Merimbula, Pambula and Eden are unaffected by fires however some national parks remain closed.The NPWS hopes Bournda national park (near Tathra) will reopen soon so visitors can enjoy its secluded beach, dolphin spotting and lagoon kayaking. The rocky 47km coastline of Ben Boyd national park between Eden and Pambula, meanwhile, has long loop walks and crystal-clear snorkelling.It’s possible to stay close to townships too. The photographer’s delight of Bermagui Blue Pool – a sea bath with showers, toilets and stairs – is good for kids or older people. Famous for its deep-sea fishing, at Bermagui Fisherman’s Wharf you’ll see tuna or kingfish coming off boats – and straight on to your plate at local favourite Il Passaggio. The new Harbar meanwhile, overlooks, well, the harbour.Merimbula has some stunning beaches to choose from, or you can do an oyster farm tour with Wheeler’s Seafood, served straight from Merimbula Lake. Sydney rock oysters are freshly shucked at Broadwater Oysters at Pambula Lake, too, or packed for a picnic from anywhere along the oyster trail. Pambula village has a splash of historic homes with bull-nose verandahs and some excellent shopping, including Wild Ryes artisanal bakery.In “the humpback highway” of Eden, the local Aboriginal land council is working to link up ancient trails to form the Bundian Way, a 365km walk. For now, you can stroll the 600-metre whale dreaming trail to learn how the Katungul people and the beowas (killer whales) interacted, or do the 1.8km beach-to-beach story trail. Kids will enjoy the Killer Whale Museum in Eden township."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1fddffe09bfaeb1670ba802a17d0eb07e41830d/0_430_5256_3153/master/5256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=919f6e95f4db1fe317629594226967ab","title":"the new york timess success lays bare the medias disastrous state","story":"A handful of legacy institutions thrive as digital startups face increasing pressuresThe financial health of journalism has been deteriorating in such an acute way that every spit and cough emanating from its institutions is anxiously pored over to ascertain whether it’s a death rattle or a sign of miraculous recovery. An outcome few would have predicted for the future of media has been the resilience of a handful of decidedly old-fashioned legacy institutions, at the cost of the shrinking of the supposedly more innovative digital players.The new gatekeepers of the global media, which are mostly American and Chinese mega-platforms such as Facebook, WeChat, YouTube, Google, Apple and co, have created a business environment that is inherently hostile towards free, advertising-supported media.Costly journalism is the first casualty of an advertising model that favours these online platforms. Those organisations that have unbelievably survived the past 15 years of digital onslaught are defined by both the presence of mission and money.Take for instance the New York Times, the midtown Manhattan local news organisation which is transforming itself into a global digital news brand. Historically characterised by its preponderance of seersucker suits and Mont Blanc pens, the “Grey Lady” was on the critical list a decade ago. Weakened by the financial crisis, its market capitalisation had halved to $1.5bn (£1.16bn) and its lavishly staffed newsroom numbers were heading south of 1,300. When it introduced a paywall in 2011 it felt like a last roll of the dice.Even as recently as 2013 former publisher Arthur Sulzberger noted that it was a “very low moment” when the New York Times’s biggest rival, the Washington Post, was sold by the Graham family to Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos.Last week, the New York Times emerged from its period of digital transition as a financially stronger, editorially robust organisation. It hit its very ambitious target of earning $800m per annum through digital revenues 12 months early and its share price rose to a 15-year high.The newsroom, no doubt too busy to celebrate as it documents the unravelling of American politics, is at a historic high level of 1,700 journalists.Ironically, this remarkable revival in both its subscription base and its share performance stems from the policies of Donald Trump. Digital subscriptions have boomed as the progressive audience sees support for reporting institutions like the New York Times as the only effective opposition to a corrupt government.And the stock market boom, as we are constantly reminded by the president’s Twitter feed, is peaking on the basis of an economic policy that largely favours rich business owners at the cost of everyone else.The revolving door between media organisations is in constant motion, but as the layoffs in local and digital news outlets continue, the New York Times is hiring many more than it is firing. Many of those who have joined as either staff or columnists come from the world of digitally native publishing.Ben Smith, former editor-in-chief at BuzzFeed, left the newsroom he founded to join the New York Times as a media columnist. Pioneers of journalism startups such as Kara Swisher, America’s best-known technology reporter and commentator, joined the huge roster of writers. Choire Sicha, a key founder of defunct but highly influential sites such as Gawker and the Awl, now heads the styles section. Taylor Lorenz has joined, bringing with her beat reporting on influencers and TikTok, making the New York Times relevant to a whole new audience. The Daily Podcast is also hugely popular among younger audiences. This isn’t how the future was meant to be.Chief executive, and former BBC director general, Mark Thompson put the success of the New York Times down to a strategy that allowed the digital assets within the news organisation to grow independently of the gravitational pull of the still-declining print product. Crosswords and cookery, both addictive and slick digital offerings, are far more important in revenue terms than their positions in a printed package would indicate.However, there’s something else at play here which has more to do with the political and economic environment.An aging audience of wealthy newspaper subscribers helped get the New York Times across the wobbly bridge to a digital world, where now, the same elderly subscribers have embraced digital subscriptions on their iPhones.The adaptation of the BBC as an extended platform to support local reporting was also effectively nixed by budget cuts. Further pressure on funding comes from the government’s dogged determination to decriminalise the licence fee a consultation on the matter was launched only this week. Facebook’s refusal to curb lies in political advertising has been immediately rewarded by the culture, media and sport select committee switching emphasis from probing platform power to exploring how to diminish public service media.The culture secretary Nicky Morgan’s most high profile utterance on the task of rethinking media was to urge the BBC to be more digitally adaptable, so as to not end up like video rental chain Blockbuster. It should be far more concerning to Morgan and the British electorate that instead the BBC ends up like Netflix: undifferentiated, afloat only on borrowed money, and inherently uninterested in the cultural needs of a population that needs reliable news."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3646ba391ff6b8b244e3a70aef3a78e3859a36/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e7123b968311a8ff8d0fbda18204341","title":"should i buy a manual petrol car or automatic hybrid","story":"My children are likely to learn to drive on it – and I’m wondering if the era of geared cars is overEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.I’d like to buy a hybrid car but they’re nearly all automatics.

We meet the angry AlabamansMike Cooley has a gift for aphorism. “Paranoia’s like pulled pork,” he says, in his deep Alabama baritone. “It’s on menus all over the world, but in the American south it’s special.” That one is the final line of a riff on guns and why southerners like weapons, one of the subjects that crops up on Drive-By Truckers’ 12th album, The Unraveling.Cooley and Patterson Hood, his fellow guitarist-singer-songwriter in the Truckers, are eating lamb meatballs on a chilly afternoon in New York, on the day The Unraveling is released. The title seems apt. A few hundred miles south, in Washington DC, Donald Trump’s impeachment trial is stalling in the Senate across the Atlantic, as we speak, the UK is leaving the EU. “Unfortunately, we kinda saw it coming,” Hood says of the release date. “Things are so crazy right now, you never know what’s gonna happen next. You just know it’s gonna be ridiculous and shitty.”The Unraveling is an album for such times. Musically, it’s business as usual: euphoric classic rock with layered guitars, interspersed with country-tinged ballads. It’s a blend that has seen country star Jason Isbell pass through their ranks, and brought Grammy nominations as well as big venues. But, lyrically, the album is filled with rage: about school shootings (Thoughts and Prayers), immigrant children (Babies in Cages), the opioid epidemic (Heroin Again), the manufacturing of anger for political ends (Grievance Merchants), and “working hard for not enough” (21st Century USA) .It’s the second explicitly political Truckers album in a row, following 2016’s American Band, which has caused a certain amount of outrage from fans who are used to the band as sympathetic chroniclers of lives fraying at the seams, rather than furious campaigners. However, as both Hood and Cooley note, anyone who’s been following their career should have known where they were coming from. The politics this time weren’t simply the result of anger, but of family life – often, says Hood, drawn from “conversations I had with my kids about some bullshit that was going on. When my son comes home scared saying, ‘Daddy, is someone going to take me away from you and Mommy and put me in a cage?’ ‘No, son, they’re not going to do that.’ ‘Well, why not?’ Well, because you’re a white kid and they’re not putting white kids in cages.’”The lead single from The Unraveling was Thoughts and Prayers, a bitter tirade about the inadequacy of politicians sending their well wishes after yet more kids have been gunned down in schools. “My daughter was in a lockdown drill at her school last week,” Hood says. “She was locked in a closet with 27 other kids for over 20 minutes, not knowing if it was a drill or not. It’s to prepare for if someone comes and starts shooting up their school.” I can’t conceal my astonishment. Cooley notices. “We’re starting to ask questions now, ‘Are we inflicting trauma on these kids, on the off chance this could happen?’”They may be from Alabama, where it is legal to carry a gun into a bar, but neither has a great deal of admiration for the second amendment, granting Americans the right “to keep and bear arms” in order to form a “well-regulated militia”. Says Cooley: “If things get to a point where I have a need to be armed when I’m out and about, whether it’s legal is going to be the least of my worries. Law and order is gone at that point.“There probably should be a legal way for a person to be able to defend themselves with a weapon. But the second amendment was in no way intended for every Tom, Dick and Yahoo to be as heavily armed as he damn well pleases anywhere he wants. The second amendment – and the electoral college – became irrelevant almost as soon as the ink dried on the paper they were written on. And they’re the two biggest pains in our ass. Nobody can go back in time and go, ‘Don’t do this!’”Hood interjects: “As far as the argument that we’re arming ourselves to keep the government in line – you know what, if the government decides to take your redneck ass out, they’ll have a drone up your butthole before you can count to 10. Good luck with that, redneck buddy.”One of the themes of Drive-By Truckers’ music has been what Hood has called “the duality of the southern thing” – the notion that liberalism and racism can both be present in the same people and institutions that the south is not a caricature but a place, for all its problems, that is steeped in humanity. But what’s important now, they say, is not any ide between north and south, but the yawning chasm between urban and rural.What the south does have, though, is the lightning rod of symbolism: the statues and memorials to civil war leaders and the Confederate dead, around which the far right can rally. Cooley mentions the notorious 2017 demonstrations in Charlottesville, “allegedly protesting the removal of a Robert E Lee statue. But they were there to threaten. For that matter, there were a couple of Confederate statues up the road in Baltimore that were also scheduled to be removed. They didn’t want to go to Baltimore, but they’d go to a little white-bread-assed college town in Virginia.”These are the attitudes that have caused horror among some of their fanbase. After American Band, Cooley wondered if they should try something different. “But I was like, ‘I don’t want these people to think I’m walking away because they said mean things about me.’”“We do have some redneck in us,” Hood adds. “We don’t necessarily let anyone tell us what to do.”“Fuck you,” Cooley says to those who want a return to character songs about good ol’ boys, drawing the “you” out into a sigh of disdain. “You know what? I’m gonna do it again, just because you bitched about it. I’m leaving that toilet seat up.”Hood and Cooley have known each other for 35 years, having met as roommates at the University of Alabama. Any relationship lasting that long has its ups and downs, but there’s a deep understanding between them – they finish each other’s sentences and laugh delightedly when the other says something that tickles. They recognise that together, they are more than the sum of their parts. “Have you ever seen two ugly people have a good-looking baby?” Cooley says. “It happens.”And as twilight falls on the unravelling world, Cooley remembers one thing that gives him hope: the time he lost his bank card and it was returned to him. The man who found it “had Trump voter written all over him. He was a working guy, still wearing a reflective vest, like a guy who worked road construction. Older white dude. Been working all day. Probably just wanted to take a shower, get something to eat. He found that card, tracked me down and gave it back to me. He didn’t know who had lost the card. He didn’t know the colour of the guy’s skin from the name on that card. I stored that away. I remembered that.”• The Unraveling is out now on ATO."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a217e5e31429ee82ca175d168be657bc71caaa6/0_0_5416_3251/master/5416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf9b7b113f378000158833351abc9205","title":"cosmic ray research station mount aragats photo essay","story":"Cut off during winter, a former Soviet weapons research facility high up on Mount Aragats, Armenia is now part of a network of sites around the world studying the mysterious particlesThe cosmic ray research station on Mount Aragats sits at an altitude of 3,200 metres. The site in Armenia was constructed in 1943 to conduct top-secret research into atomic reactions for the development of nuclear weapons. Now the facility provides insight into thunderstorms and cosmic rays. The only way visitors can reach the base in winter is via a nine-mile (15km) climb through snow.Arshak Mkrtchyan, a mountain guide, cuts a trail to the station in snowshoes in temperatures around -22C.Arriving at the station at sunset, the wind is howling across the plateau and the temperature has plummeted to dangerous levels.Technicians at the facility work one month on, one month off during the winter.Inside the station, it is surprisingly cosy. Edik Arshakian and Gurgen Jabaryan, both technicians, are tasked with monitoring the scientific equipment, while Gohar Hovhannisian prepares the meals. She describes being somewhat trapped during the winter.Hovhannisian presides over an enormous kitchen built during the Soviet period, when scores of technicians were required to monitor and maintain rudimentary equipment. In winter she cooks mostly for just two technicians and herself.The confusingly named “rays” are, in fact, high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that zip through space at nearly the speed of light.When they meet the Earth’s atmosphere they strike atoms and scatter them like snooker balls. These particles have the power to cut through material, including humans, and are sometimes blamed for corrupting digital memory and crashing computers.The particles are one of the main obstacles to interplanetary travel, and their effects on astronauts and pilots are the subject of continued study.High-altitude bases such as the one on Aragats are exposed to far higher doses of the cosmic specks than occurs at sea level, since the Earth’s atmosphere serves as a protective blanket.The Aragats facility is part of a network of sites around the world studying cosmic rays and is linked to research stations as far away as Costa Rica and Indonesia.As well as studying cosmic rays, the centre is equipped with sensors that can record lightning strikes from miles around. In 2018, researchers using the sensors on Aragats found a link between thunderclouds and drastic spikes in radiation, which may affect passengers and crew onboard aircraft.Soviet-era electronics abound at the base. Amid the economic turmoil that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aragats station was kept alive by state funds and donations from the Armenian diaspora community which continue today.Dotted around the centre, “scintillators” record incoming cosmic rays as they strike chunks of clear plastic inside, causing tiny flashes of light.Although Aragats is a thriving research site in summer, when visitors can arrive by car, through the long winter months it is a lonely place almost cut off from the rest of the world.Jabaryan jokes that his favourite part of working at the site is “when the snowmobile comes to pick me up at the end of the month”. But the isolation of this mountain station is a worthy sacrifice for science since, as Hovhannisian says: “We’re above civilisation. The cosmic particles arrive clear and pure here since there’s nothing to disturb them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China has reached 563, as health experts prepared to meet in Geneva next week in an attempt to develop a vaccine and Japan reported 10 more infections among passengers aboard a luxury cruise liner quarantined outside Yokohama.China’s national health commission said that, as of midnight Wednesday, there were 28,018 confirmed cases throughout the country – a rise of 3,694 and the biggest 24-hour rise – as well as 24,702 suspected cases.Outside mainland China, at least 230 cases have been confirmed, including two fatalities, one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.If you’ve been affected and would like to share your experience or news tips, anonymously if you prefer, direct with our journalists then please do so via the form below.

Adil and Mo coming in and showing their value, Adil with the control and variation he was outstanding. I thought the chase was well within our grasp, and it was disappointing to limp over the line. I thought we should have done it four or five down with the partnerships we had.”For Rashid this was a first proper game since November, having worked hard in the gym to regain the “snap” in his action after his shoulder injury. On a pitch that does not often take spin he said the key was his use of variations. His googly in particular had an alluring amount of dip and fizz.“One thing I look to strive on is my variations in whatever conditions, that’s a big part of my armoury,” he said. “Today was one of those days where I tried it and it came out nicely.”When asked Rashid also explicitly ruled himself out of any chance of selection for the Sri Lanka Test tour, the squad for which will be announced next week.“I’ve got to go back into county cricket, get the performances under my belt and then get selected on merit. If the selectors do ask me ‘if you are available, can you play?’ it would be a straight ‘no’. I feel as though I’ve got to deserve my place back in the team.”South Africa’s captain Quinton de Kock praised the “energy” of his team in defeat. “We thought it was getting tight at the end. We gave ourselves a sniff and it was cool to make it tough for the England guys.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68bef438baf2ce00ee5b57d3f9b5c67ddf864a74/0_42_3034_1820/master/3034.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc5a3f2e24b1c87b0cb469b17e07a5a4","title":"france italy six nations match report","story":"Romain Ntamack raced in the bonus-point score in Paris as France laboured to a patchy 35-22 victory over Italy.The Toulouse fly-half endured a mixed afternoon, struggling with his goal-kicking in strong winds caused by Storm Ciara.Teddy Thomas, Charles Ollivon, Gregory Alldritt, Ntamack and Baptiste Serin all crossed for the French, who coasted to victory despite several phases of wayward attacking play.Wasps’ electric wing Matteo Minozzi, hooker Federico Zani and Mattia Bellini bagged tries for the battling Azzurri, but Franco Smith’s side still slipped to a 24th straight Six Nations loss.France have not won the Six Nations since their 2010 grand slam, but hopes will now be high that the drought can come to an end. Galthie’s side will face a strong test of their title credentials when heading to Wales on February 22 though. Factor in the return of defence coach Shaun Edwards to his old Principality Stadium stomping ground, and that encounter will doubtless prove pivotal to the tournament.And Paul Willemse has warned France will need to cut out their indiscipline to stay in the hunt. The South Africa-born lock lamented Les Bleus’ errant showing and admitted they must sharpen up, especially without the ball.“It was definitely a bit frustrating against Italy, we got what we wanted with the bonus point so we’re happy with that,” Willemse told BBC Sport.“But our performance, a lot of errors especially discipline wise so we’ve got to fix that as quickly as possible.“Our previous game it wasn’t a big thing, so we definitely want to fix that as quickly as possible, it’s not normal for us to have so many penalties. But that will definitely be a focus in the weeks to come to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”Les Bleus bludgeoned into early control, Thomas racing in after neat build-up. Ollivon then doubled the hosts’ try count, punching over the line from short range.Minozzi then capped a fine 13-phase move with a morale-boosting score for the Azzurri and Tommaso Allan’s penalty just shy of the half-hour hauled Italy into touching distance at 13-10 down, but the visitors could not muster enough of a comeback to alter the outcome.The France No 8 Alldritt cantered home having lurked on the left wing and been duly furnished with a superb floated pass from Antoine Dupont to leave France leading 23-10 at the break.A largely forgettable third quarter came and went without incident, before France sealed the bonus point.Italy’s first-half rally had long evaporated when Ntamack bisected the visiting defence and Les Bleus’ fourth.Zani registered for Italy however, dotting the ball against the base of the post for the Azzurri’s second try.Again the Italians were unable to make good on any kind of comeback though, and replacement half-back Serin scored with a sharp quick-tap try.Italy managed the last word, with Bellini scampering home after Jayden Hayward’s break. But France roll on to Cardiff.Italy’s captain Luca Bigi maintained Italy are moving in the right direction under new coach Smith, despite another frustrating defeat.“We showed how strong we can be in attack,” he told BBC Sport. “We never gave up and that’s a positive.“The guys on the pitch showed great face on the pitch today.“It was a tough week because we conceded so many turnovers at the breakdown last week. We conceded too many penalties in the first half even though we were better.“We have to keep the positives from this game. It’s important that we scored at the end and we’ll keep to the positives for the Scotland game.”• All times GMT all matches on BBC or ITV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74d16ae32a52d9b65523899ed76d65012d2a4f8d/0_109_3293_1977/master/3293.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88ab0cb74192fd0e22565812a542d82d","title":"six nations what we learned second weekend","story":"Coaches talk about winning the collisions as a prerequisite to victory and Saturday showed why. Ireland controlled the gainline against Wales in defence and attack, although their one disappointment would have been giving away the greater number of penalties against opponents who were on the back foot. Ireland contested the breakdown where Wales missed Josh Navidi. CJ Stander has made his reputation as a strong ball-carrier but he ensured victory over Scotland with a late turnover penalty and he was again prominent in defence, slowing down possession and paving the way for turnovers. Ireland did not overplay their dominance at forward, looking to spread the ball wide. Their forwards carried for a total of 74 metres, fewer than Jacob Stockdale on the wing, with Ireland scenting defensive weakness wider out.England got the better of Scotland physically when it mattered, defending their line and scoring the only try from close range on an evening when the overwhelming winner was the weather. England’s chariot was wobbly but the wheels stayed on, unlike the Sunday before. As if defeat were not bad enough for the hosts’ head coach, Gregor Townsend, he was treated to a different splash in the morning with his out-of-favour outside-half, Finn Russell, saying in an interview that the two had never got on. So clearly deep-rooted are the differences that there appears to be no way back for the Racing 92 playmaker as long as Townsend remains in charge. After the backstep that was last year’s Six Nations campaign and a poor World Cup, the trip to Italy in the next round assumes the category of must win. He could do with Russell back but to make the call would be to weaken his position.South Africa’s ploy of naming six forwards on the bench in the World Cup, when the so-called Bomb Squad allowed the Springboks pretty much to maintain momentum at forward for 80 minutes, is catching on. England, whose coaching team includes Matt Proudfoot, who was in charge of the World Cup winners’ forwards, adopted the ploy against Scotland and it paid off while both France and Italy confined themselves to two backs on their benches in Paris on Sunday. The chairman of World Rugby, Sir Bill Beaumont, has called on the number of replacements to be cut, although three front-rowers will have to remain because of safety concerns. It is hard to see the number falling below six.And there were France, cruising against Italy seven days after their victory over England when, as they do, they became over-excited and their opponents found a way back. They were at their most dangerous against England when focused, carry out the game plans in defence and attack while allowing themselves a pinch of initiative. They went 13-0 up quickly against Italy, then for a while reverted to the France of old, all over the place defensively and inidual in attack. They snapped out of it after conceding 10 points only to lose their way again when the game was won, but their progress will be measured in Cardiff next week, where they have not won for 10 years. Shaun Edwards returns “home”: expect his charges to be as fired up as him.Italy have long become used to having their presence in the Six Nations questioned and in a week which ended with their 24th consecutive defeat in the tournament there was speculation that South Africa would leave the Rugby Championship in four years and make it the Seven Nations. That move would have to be endorsed by World Rugby because it would mark an expansion of the tournament, although the Springboks changing hemispheres would make room for Japan to take their place. Their commercial value is estimated to be worth four times more than South Africa’s, which is why some in Europe prefer to woo the Brave Blossoms. A championship played on six weekends would require the agreement of clubs in England and France, as well as World Rugby. Unless Italy were sacrificed.After the war of the worlds in Asia last year comes the war of the words in Europe. Words like brutal and hate have been exchanged in the last couple of weeks and Ellis Genge, England’s try scorer at Murrayfield, after the match referred to England’s critics as “sausages”, presumably because they had noticed that in Paris in the opening round the chariot had been exchanged for an old banger. It is not as if trash-talking is needed to sell tickets, unless Italy are in town and then the words would not have much of a target. As the former Scotland second-row Peter Brown said last week, players from opposing sides should socialise after matches. They used to but now they are whisked off for warm-downs or handshakes with sponsors. Tea and antipathy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9c1537b056ca2f5c12aa1637bc03ca4ed8a55a5/0_175_4667_2800/master/4667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=288761b908302f2ba870d50149cccaed","title":"tom curran stands out england ugly win","story":"England will not care in the slightest that their victory over Scotland was one of the ugliest in recent memory. In fact, I felt that they were set up to play the kind of game they did and the conditions only reinforced it was the right way to go about things. I have said a number of times that England are the best wet-weather team in the world and, though it was scrappy, they got the job done.The key to their victory was their ability to win the battle for middle earth. In that middle third of the field they came out on top and a lot of that was down to the work they did at the breakdown. Two years ago that was a problem area for England but on Saturday Eddie Jones in effect picked three openside flankers and it paid idends. They were able to force Scotland to play from deep and feed off the turnovers which gave them the opportunity to kick at goal or into the corners. With the weather the way it was it turned into a game where not having the ball was key.I thought Lewis Ludlam showed up well, Sam Underhill had another excellent game and Tom Curry was outstanding. He looked that little bit more comfortable at No 8. He is not playing the role in the traditional manner yet. He was more like an extra No 7 against Scotland but the more he plays there the more he will develop. I’ve heard Eddie compare him to Rodney So’oialo. I played with Rodney and I can see some similarities. Curry is a good ball carrier. He’s a big strong guy. We haven’t seen it all that much in these last two matches but he’s powerful, he’s got good leg drive and he makes yards after contact. He drives through and he’s got good body height. We probably haven’t seen him with ball in hand as much as we would have liked but Eddie has identified he is more natural at doing that than, say, Underhill and I guess that’s why he’s the guy they want to move to No 8.Rodney had to do that as well. He was a great seven but with the options New Zealand had at the time there he had to move to No 8 and he had to adjust his game a little bit. You probably expect your No 8s to carry a bit more but that’s something Tom will just have to get used to. I’m sure he’s got the ability to do it.Against Scotland he, Ludlam and Underhill were constant nuisances, waiting for that opportunity. England had numbers on their feet and I felt that their decision-making was good. It wasn’t as if they had everyone going into every ruck, they were very particular about where and when they wanted to do it, targeting the wide breakdowns and making the right decisions in between the 15s. They weren’t putting too many in. They wanted numbers on feet because you could see with the conditions, especially when Scotland were kicking, you could see the scrum-halves, Willi Heinz and then Ben Youngs, marshalling the back row.That is probably what told in the end – England’s ability to keep the suffocating stranglehold on the breakdown and control that better. Yes, they kicked the ball out on the full a lot but, when the crucial moments came, they executed when they needed to. I thought England on the whole got the win they deserved. Neither side played particularly well but England took their chance and Scotland didn’t. Scotland had their opportunities but again, as in the Ireland game, they struggled to get over the line five metres out. England waited for that one opportunity - it was a great kick in behind by George Ford to put the pressure on. They had the set-piece dominance and two phases later they got the try. And that was it – a one-score game.England fought and ground out the victory and that’s what you have to do sometimes, especially away from home. They’ll acknowledge they weren’t really able to get into their shape on the pitch due to the weather but they did win the territorial battle. If they looked a bit vulnerable anywhere, it was in the set piece. It didn’t function as well as it could early on but it did towards the end. It was a good old-fashioned Six Nations match and both teams will try to move on from it as soon as possible.The great thing is that England have two weeks now to prepare for Ireland. They can hone what they want to do in attack. They will have to be much more accurate and clinical against a confident Ireland side. But I’m sure we’ll see a lot more understanding of the shape they want. Ireland impressed me against Wales. They looked more fluent in attack than in their first match against Scotland and seemed far more threatening. One does not expect Wales to get overrun like that in terms of physicality but CJ Stander and Tadhg Furlong led the charge in that regard. It was a bit of a statement really, they won the physical battle and scored four tries and they’ll be off to Twickenham with their tails up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8322b02fccb03ca36c42116b2fcf6f07012b0302/160_0_5623_3374/master/5623.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e9a1e1137e23d495cb54a4427c945be","title":"in pictures eight hidden gems of north west france","story":"From vintage steam trains and magical medieval chateaux to corking sparkling wine, north-west France has something to offer all the family.Feeling inspired?

Luckily, there was plenty of woe to keep them satisfiedDoctor Who once again continues its Further Adventures in Wokeness. This week, the mental health crisis! Two malevolent “Eternal Beings”, Zellin and Akara, have decided to amuse themselves for eternity by feeding off the nightmares of humanity, having identified us as pathetic saplings governed by our fear, shame and paranoia. There are also monsters running round a psych hospital in 14th-century Aleppo, for reasons of their own.This would be fertile ground for Doctor Who anyway, given that the show lives off nightmares and monsters under the bed and that special place behind the sofa. But new writer Charlene James delivers something more, with a rare chance to explore the internal lives of Team Tardis. As the Doctor drops her chums back for a home visit to Sheffield, it’s not long before Zellin and his creepy removable fingers are getting under their skin and exacerbating their darkest moments.In a further welcome development for Mandip Gill, we get to see Yaz’s past struggles with bullying and self-esteem issues. Ryan also can’t shake the feeling that his new freewheeling intergalactic lifestyle has plunged his abandoned best mate Tibo deep into depression. And Graham has a more acute form of survivor’s guilt, haunted by dreams of Grace, the wife he was unable to save (a welcome return cameo from Sharon D Clarke), and paranoia about his cancer returning. Not even the Doctor is safe, plagued in her own dreams and visions by clues about the prophecy of the Timeless Child.Certainly, this show has rarely felt further away from the jolly adventures of a Silurian detective, her lesbian lover and their Sontaran butler. However, what it does do is allow Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor another one of her trademark empowering speeches, forcefully warning Zellin and Akara that humanity’s ability to carry on through whatever challenges the mind may throw at us is a unique example of our strength and resilience. And Tibo ends up getting the help he needs. All we need now is a helpline.As has often been the case this year, the adventure itself is somewhat secondary to the theme here. Aside from the fact that you do actually need a plot, the whole business with Akara being imprisoned between planets, orbs, quantum fluctuation locks and whatnot was the least engaging element of Can You Hear Me? The Aleppo subplot also felt a little random. Certainly, it allowed for bonus wokeness. The plight of Tahira points out that atrocities in Syria are nothing new, and the Doctor gets to offer another history lesson, telling us: “Islamic hospitals were known for the enlightened way they treated mental health problems.”A story based around nightmares would do well to deliver some proper nightmare fuel. And Can You Hear Me? does not disappoint, the claw-around-the-face moment proving a particular standout, while Zellin’s creepy detachable fingers persistently unsettle. It’s a fact that probably the most marked improvement this year from Whittaker’s debut series is that Doctor Who is scary again. Amen to that.Meanwhile, details are emerging about the imminent two-part finale. With the episodes now named as Ascension of the Cybermen and The Timeless Children, it will come as no surprise that the Doctor’s second-deadliest enemies will take centre stage. “It’s a big, big Cyberman story, that last two-parter. There are a lot of Cybermen coming in this series,” Chibnall told the Mirror. “It might start with one Cyberman, but you’ll see a lot. It’s as epic and emotional as the opening two-parter. I know it takes place across a big distance from space, there’s fantastic spaceships, there’s Cybermen.”But is that really there all is to their return? Next week’s episode is a historical one, featuring Mary Shelley and Lord Byron, and reveals that it was an encounter with the Cybermen that inspired the former to write Frankenstein. Or possibly just the one? Could Captain Jack’s warning “beware the lone Cyberman” be a reference to Frankenstein’s actual monster – an abomination arising from the actions of those who would seek to amend humanity? Space and time will tell.It’s time to visit Mary Shelley and Lord Byron as the series careers towards a conclusion. Get ready for The Haunting of Villa Diodati."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ba63565ab0009cbe7e683a1bde8b0917538781/0_292_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a878fee67e593217940fcfbb49e647a","title":"michael bloomberg unusual campaign 10m ads self funding super tuesday focus","story":"The billionaire ex-mayor decided to forgo New Hampshire and all other early primary states and has invested $188m in his campaignIn their stump speeches, advertising, and meet-and-greets, the top 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are eagerly sniping at each other as they criss cross the Granite state in the final days before the critical New Hampshire Democratic primary on Tuesday.Yet one person is conspicuously absent. Looming over the race is fellow candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire who has decided to completely forgo New Hampshire and all other early primary states to instead invest heavily in the crucial set of Super Tuesday states that vote on 3 March – an unconventional and risky strategy.Bloomberg is “spending millions to buy the election,” Sanders warned this week.“How do we feel about living in so-called democracy when a billionaire multiple time over can do that? How do we feel when we have candidates in the Democratic party taking money from billionaires?”Having spent at least $10m on a 60-second advert in the Super Bowl last week, Bloomberg has since capitalised on the chaos from the Iowa caucuses, in which both self-described Democratic socialist Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and moderate former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg declared victories, though the race was officially too close to call.Former vice-president Joe Biden, who had been seen as the frontrunner among the moderate candidates, trailed in fourth and called the Iowa result a “gut punch”. Bloomberg, who has cast himself as the moderate to beat Trump and banked on Biden falling behind, responded by doubling his advertising spending.At a press conference about the Iowa results, Sanders said it was “an absolute outrage” that Bloomberg would also likely qualify for the next televised presidential debate in Nevada later this month, when he is not even on the ballot there. “I guess if you’re worth $55b you can get the rules changed to debate.”Besides eschewing the early primary states, Bloomberg has opted to self-fund his campaign and has poured in over $188m. He has also quietly been working to bottleneck funding avenues for other the campaigns of other candidates by urging deep pocketed donors to give to Democratic committees instead.While other candidates have doggedly toured New Hampshire and early primary states, Bloomberg has been campaigning in locales that are later on the voting calendar, like Oklahoma, California, Colorado, and Pennsylvania. Bloomberg has already visited every Super Tuesday state in a two-month period.“Since day one, our campaign has been focused on building a nationwide operation that is engaging with voters daily about Mike’s record on key issues and why he’s the strongest Democrat in the race,” Bloomberg states director Dan Kanninen said.“While other candidates focus on New Hampshire, we’re committed to winning delegates on Super Tuesday and beating Donald Trump in November.”His campaign has ballooned to 2,100 people, with 1,700 of them in the states and 400 at the campaign’s headquarters in New York. Other campaigns have staffs in the hundreds. By the end of this week the campaign says it will have opened 125 offices.Whichever candidate emerges as the presumptive frontrunner after the early primary contests end with the South Carolina primary on 29 February, they will then have to face a moneyed Bloomberg effectively lying in wait to attack.Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic party chairwoman who has endorsed Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who placed third in Iowa, said even though Bloomberg isn’t campaigning in New Hampshire his presence is still felt.“We see the ads here in New Hampshire although he’s not on the ballot here,” Sullivan said. “I think he will be a major factor going forward because of just the amount of money he’s spending and because he’s playing in all those Super Tuesday states.”And some New Hampshire voters are intrigued. Bill Mauser, a US Navy veteran who attended an event for Buttigieg this week called Bloomberg an “interesting prospect”.“He’s a very accomplished self-made man, doesn’t have a retail politics approach,” Mauser said. “He certainly has chops but the question is, are his chops good enough to really qualify him to be a leader? So how do I feel about him? I’m open to what he has to say.”For his rivals, the critique of Bloomberg is almost always the same: that he’s buying his way into the presidential election.During Friday night’s televised Democratic debate, Warren was asked about the seeming unlimited amount of spending behind the former New York mayor’s candidacy. She said: “I don’t think anyone should be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States.”During an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union in January, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, another Democratic presidential candidate, likened Bloomberg to Donald Trump.“When people look at the White House and see this multi-millionaire messing up so many things,” Klobuchar said. “I don’t think they think, ‘Oh, we need someone richer.’ I think you have to earn votes, not buy them.”But Bloomberg’s strategy is causing some Democrats to recalibrate how they think of the primary calendar. Maura Keefe, a Democratic strategist and former chief of staff to New Hampshire senator Jeanne Shaheen, said Bloomberg’s massive spending calls into question just how valuable winning an early primary state is these days.“The money piece is what’s the monetary value of winning New Hampshire or winning and coming in second,” Keefe said. “What is the value of that free press? That attention? We’re already seeing the value of Buttigieg’s surprise in Iowa for him here. And if somebody surprised in New Hampshire by beating expectations there’s a monetary value in that.””But Keefe added that she didn’t see Bloomberg as a trending topic among votersyet, just “a topic of conversation certainly amongst the media and maybe political elites.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f059cfd83dbac594a672620dc2c130389b583f3/0_282_5110_3066/master/5110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87a774d6a3409c54937c712e9f55e003","title":"new hampshire democratic candidates bernie sanders buttigieg biden","story":"Sanders maintains lead over other candidates, according to CNN poll, while Biden under pressure to revive campaign Leading Democratic presidential candidates have stepped up attacks against each other ahead of the New Hampshire primary, with Joe Biden saying Bernie Sanders’ democratic socialism would turn off voters in moderate states in a general election against Donald Trump.Sanders has maintained his lead over the other 10 candidates going into Tuesday’s vote, according to a CNN poll released on Sunday, with former mayor Pete Buttigieg in second, Biden in third and the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren in fourth.Biden, who has long been seen as a frontrunner in the race, is particularly under pressure to revive his campaign after suffering what he called a “gut punch” result in the Iowa caucuses last week, which saw him come in fourth. Both Sanders and Buttigieg declared victory in a race that was marred by chaotic results, and ended up too close to call.On ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Biden was asked if he thought Democrats can’t defeat the president if they have to defend socialism.“I think it’s going to be incredibly more difficult. I’m not going to say – look, if I don’t get the nomination and Bernie gets it, I’m going to work like hell for him,” the former vice-president said of the Vermont senator.“But I’ll tell you what, it’s a bigger uphill climb running as a senator or a congressperson or as a governor on a ticket that calls itself a democratic socialist ticket.”Trump has already begun waging a negative campaign against the spectre of socialism ahead of November’s election, often singling out Sanders, 78, a self-declared democratic socialist with climate, education and healthcare plans costing trillions of dollars.Biden also called out Buttigieg during an event on Saturday, saying the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a city of 100,000 people, lacked experience.“I do not believe we’re a party at risk if they nominate me, and I do believe we’re a party at risk if we nominate someone who’s never held a higher office than mayor,” Biden said at a rally in Manchester.“This guy’s not a Barack Obama!” he added, dismissing comparisons with Obama during the presidential campaign in 2008, when Biden said he also lacked experience.“Well, he’s right, I’m not. And neither is he. Neither is any of us running for president,” Buttigieg told CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union on Sunday. He added: “This isn’t 2008 – it’s 2020, and we are in a new moment calling for a different kind of leadership.”Asked whether “the Democrats can defeat Donald Trump if they have to defend socialism”, Buttigieg told Stephanopoulos on ABC that it would be “harder”.“I think it will be a lot harder. But the bigger concern that I have is further iding the country. You know, when the campaign says that either you’re for a revolution or you must be for the status quo -- most of us don’t see where we fit in that picture,” Buttigieg said.“And the irony is at this moment, we actually have a historic American majority, not just the line around what we’re against, we need to get rid of Donald Trump, but what we’re for,” he continued. “Let’s hold together and not blow up that American majority.”Appearing on CNN, Sanders was asked about Biden’s criticism that the Democratic socialist label would hurt candidates in other races.Sanders said that his agenda – a higher minimum wage and healthcare system for all – had “overwhelming” support.“Our agenda is the agenda of working-class and middle-class Americans,” Sanders said.Sanders also addressed criticism of socialism on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, including Trump’s past allegations that Sanders is a “communist”.“No 1, in many respects – in many respects, we are a socialist society today. We have a huge budget. It puts money into all areas,” Sanders responded, saying that Trump received hundreds of millions in subsidies and tax breaks for his businesses.“The difference between my socialism and Trump’s socialism is, I believe the government should help working families, not billionaires,” he said.On CBS’s Face the Nation, Buttigieg also addressed criticism that he wasn’t experienced.One Biden attack ad, for example, states that Biden “helped save the auto industry, which revitalized the economy of the midwest and led the passage and implementation of the Recovery Act, saving our economy from a depression. Pete Buttigieg revitalized the sidewalks of downtown South Bend by laying out decorative brick.”Chris Meagher, Buttigieg’s national press secretary, said: “While Washington politics trivializes what goes on in communities like South Bend, South Bend residents who now have better jobs, rising income and new life in their city don’t think their lives are a Washington politician’s punchline.”Elaborating on Sunday, Buttigieg said: “Maybe my community does look good from – does look small from the perspective of Washington. But to us, a lot of times, it’s the infighting in the Washington establishment … that looks small.” Stephanopoulos asked Warren why she did not raise her hand when asked whether she was concerned about having a Democratic socialist on the ballot during the televised New Hampshire debate on Friday night. But the Massachusetts senator declined to be drawn.“So, look, I am not – I am a capitalist. I’m a – I believe in markets.

A centre-right party with a socially progressive tilt. In office since 2011, first led by Enda Kenny, then\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, with support from smaller coalition partners. Traces roots to Michael Collins and the winning side in Ireland’s 1922-23 civil war. The party traditionally advocates market economics and fiscal discipline. Appeals to the urban middle class and well-off farmers.Its name means Soldiers of Destiny. A centrist, ideologically malleable party that dominated Irish politics until it steered the Celtic Tiger economy over a cliff, prompting decade-long banishment to opposition benches. Under Micheál Martin, a nimble political veteran, it has clawed back support and may overtake Fine Gael as the biggest party and lead the next coalition government. Founded by Éamon de Valera, who backed the civil war’s losing side but turned Fianna Fáil into an election-winning machine.Its name means We Ourselves, signifying Irish sovereignty. A leftwing republican party that competes in Northern Ireland as well as the Republic. Traces roots to 1905. Emerged in current form during the Troubles, when it was linked to the IRA. Peace in Northern Ireland helped Sinn Féin rebrand as a working-class advocate opposed to austerity. Under Mary Lou McDonald, a Dubliner without paramilitary baggage, Sinn Féin is the third-biggest party. But Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil deem it too toxic for any coalition.Partnership with Fine Gael during post-Celtic Tiger austerity tainted the centre-left Labour party but it seems poised to return to government in coalition with Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. The political arm of the trade union movement, it is led by Brendan Howlin, a former teacher and government minister.The Social Democrats and Solidarity-People Before Profit are part of an alphabet soup of smaller, more leftwing parties. The Greens, wiped out in 2011 after a ruinous coalition with Fianna Fáil, hope to win a clutch of seats on the back of climate crisis anxiety and youth-led protests. Independent TDs have prospered in recent elections, turning some into outsized players in ruling coalitions. Rory CarrollMany were young and wanted to shake things up, to deliver a black eye not just to Leo Varadkar’s ruling Fine Gael party but to the main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, which they deemed too crusty and complicit in the system they sought to change.The great paradox is that unification with Northern Ireland, the cause that birthed Sinn Féin in its modern form and still defines it, barely featured in the campaign. Britain, Brexit, Boris Johnson were not even blips on the radar. For many in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other towns, the troubles are about paying rent, not murky historical events north of the border.It would be easy to depict this as the inevitable destination of a long march led by a savvy, mercurial guide, Gerry Adams. In 1986 he recognised that the IRA would not be able to bomb its way to a united Ireland and persuaded the republican movement to abandon its policy of abstention and to compete for – and take – seats in the Irish parliament, Dáil Éireann.Few inside or outside Sinn Féin foresaw its breakthrough this week. Last year, after all, the party suffered big losses in European and council elections. Mary Lou McDonald, a Dubliner, had replaced Adams but struggled to enthuse the republican base and attract new voters.With support slumping, the party fielded just 42 candidates for the 160-seat Dáil, a strategy to minimise losses. Then the campaign started and its popularity rose – and rose.Varadkar tried to make the election about the humming economy and his record on Brexit but voters were fatigued with Fine Gael, in office since 2011, and jaded with Fianna Fáil, which had backed Varadkar in a confidence-and-supply deal.The shock of the crash, when Ireland meekly accepted its austerity medicine, had ebbed, exposing anger at the cost of living and patchy public services. Young people who got a taste for voting in the marriage equality and abortion referendums were ready for something new.Instead of a tide for the Greens – who appear to have done well, but not spectacularly – it turned into a wave for McDonald and colleagues such as Pearse Doherty and Eoin Ó Broin who articulated leftwing solutions to Ireland’s problems.Fielding so few candidates, however, may cap the number of seats to around 30 – well below Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael – making Sinn Féin a contender to join but not lead a coalition. Both parties have ruled out entering into government with Sinn Féin but Dáil arithmetic may force U-turns or an FFFG alliance, or a fresh election.The republican slogan “tiocfaidh ár lá” means “our day will come”. Sinn Féin didn’t know that meant now.

And they all came together at one of the most-watched live television events of the time, when feminist protesters stormed the stage at Miss World 1970, and a black woman walked away from the beauty contest with the crown for the first time.Fifty years on, that night is being retold in a film, Misbehaviour, inspired by the memoir of Jennifer Hosten, who won the contest and made history. In the decades that have followed, the one-time beauty queen has come to the conclusion that she and the women disrupting the competition had more in common than they might have thought.“I didn’t realise it fully at the time but we were all using that contest as a way to get a message across,” she told the Observer last week. “For me it was about race and inclusion – for them, it was about female exploitation.”Hosten, who came from the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada to scoop the crown at the age of 23, was peeking through the stage curtain at the Royal Albert Hall, a few feet from compere Bob Hope as he delivered his now infamous opening remarks.“I don’t want you to think I’m a dirty old man because I never give women a second thought,” he said. “My first thought covers everything.”“He was struggling,” remembered Hosten, now 72. She recalled hearing a firecracker go off and seeing people running scared. But the huge bang was from a group of well-dressed women who had started pelting the US comedian with flour bombs, then rose up in outrage. “We’re not beautiful, we’re not ugly. We’re ANGRY!” they screamed.The supposed firecracker was actually a football rattle, sounded by a women’s liberation activist and designed as a cue for the other feminists strategically planted among the audience to leap into action. The plan had been to kick things off when the contestants were on stage being paraded around in their swimwear, but Hosten says the women were so outraged by Hope’s jokes that the rattle went off early. “It was a big deal then, it’s still a big deal now!” she added.Watched on TV by over 22 million people in Britain, and 100 million worldwide, the incident was seen as a galvanising moment for the women’s liberation movement and is to be retold in the film starring Keira Knightley, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Jessie Buckley later this year. Hosten’s memoir, Miss World 1970, will be published next month.But for Hosten it was also a big win for racial equality. Not only was she crowned Miss World but her friend, Pearl Jansen from South Africa, was the runner-up. Organisers had been shamed into sending her, a black contestant, at the last minute but Jansen had to be known as Miss Africa South because there was already a white Miss South Africa.Hosten recalls Jansen telling her there was a reason for black women being represented at the contest that was “much more important than just representing our country”.Her success, however, outraged sections of the tabloid media. The Sun newspaper presented Hosten’s victory as a conspiracy by black members of the judging panel. “How else could a black girl with 25:1 odds have walked away with the title? That’s what they were saying,” she said.And it wasn’t only the press. Eric Morley – the then head of the Miss World beauty business – had handpicked 15 of the 58 contestants for a dress rehearsal the night before the event, parading them before the cameras. “They were his favourites,” Hosten said. “But only one of them – Miss Guyana – was a woman of colour. The rest of us were told to go and sit down with the audience.”Hosten was shocked. Growing up in Grenada she had not thought much about skin colour. That changed when she arrived in Britain for the show.“It was such an eye-opener, seeing the way the media only saw beauty by European standards. It was supposed to be Miss World – people of different races and different cultures. Most of us were written off before we even started.”It made her participation much more meaningful, she said. “It made me want to win.”When she did just that she was celebrated right across the Caribbean. In 1970 Grenada still didn’t have independence from Britain, so it was an opportunity to put her small country on the map. “I showed off my country and showed that women can do anything,” she said.In the 50 years since then, the world has moved on. Last year, for the first time in history, Miss World, Miss Universe, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA and Miss America were all won by women of colour. “The question is, though, why are we talking about that?” said Hosten. “The fact that we’re talking about it as a big deal means to say that it is still a big deal.”Misbehaviour is released on 13 March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611b759ed2d1355b50e03f18b733db9b3a4c8109/0_84_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=575b78129e55b898943b57e148b8ccf7","title":"moria refugee camp doctors story lesbos greece","story":"On the Greek island of Lesbos is the Moria refugee camp, constructed for 3,100 people but now with a population of more than 20,000 men, women and children. It has become a place of violence, deprivation, suffering and despair. I am a doctor from London and I have just spent three weeks working for the Boat Refugee Foundation (BRF). This was my third time there – and my most shocking.I kept a diary of the cases I saw, thinking it would be cathartic after the chaos to read through one or two major incidents, for personal processing purposes. Little did I know how much the events from just one day would catch in my throat on re-reading. And the next day, and the next. I want to tell you about one day in the life of the little portable cabin clinic where I worked. I am the narrator of the stories of the people still there this is not about me.People queue outside the wire-fenced cabin for hours before the clinic opens at four, hoping to be able to speak to a doctor about their child’s rash, their pregnancy-related abdominal pains, their hallucinations and flashbacks from witnessed violence, their sleep disturbance, their itch from having to wear nappies at night for fear of having to go to the toilet in the pitch-black camp. There has been no reliable electricity in the camp for more than two-and-a-half months now (with 20,000 people trying to use a grid made for 3,000, it constantly trips and cannot be relied upon for any period of time), and the threat of violence and sexual violence is incredibly high. Women and minors largely choose to wear nappies to avoid having to leave their tents after the sun goes down.They come with infected wounds that need cleaning and bandaging they have minimal access to clean water out in the olive grove areas. They come with the infamous “Moria flu” and a whole range of chronic problems one would normally expect in a population of this size. Any chronic problems are advised to come back to doctors working in the daytime: this clinic is for acute care only, for emergencies only. And we work at full capacity.Patients can only enter with their police papers, known as their ausweis, which contain their photograph, name and number. They are triaged at the door by one medic alongside a translator in Farsi and Arabic. “Green” patients need urgent care “yellow” patients are severely unwell with abnormal vital signs and require a full examination on a bed “red” emergency patients usually suffer from major panic attacks, extreme pain, collapses and, increasingly, life-threatening stab wounds or the results of other violence.We are a team from across the world – when I was on Lesbos there was a mix of Dutch, French, English, American and Spanish doctors, nurses and support crew. We work together with our translators (refugees living in the camp themselves, volunteering daily in return for bus tickets, phone credit, education and dinner as they are not able to stand in the food queue while working with us) from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Somalia and the Congo. We make up the clinic team, and respond together as the crowds enter.A mother comes in with her four-year-old child who has a very high fever, and who hasn’t been eating, drinking or responding to her properly for hours. To get to the cabin, she has had to walk through the camp on the side of a steep hill, weaving between UNHCR and makeshift tents, past the falafel store, the Wave of Hope for the Future school with its new library, past the barbers and people doing their washing, past the rubbish that hasn’t been cleared for a month, past the gang of wild dogs barking and running after her. She has waited patiently in line in the cold. When the gate is unlocked there is a rush of people, each shouting that they are an emergency, waving their ausweis.I call the febrile child in. The mother is crying and the father looks ashen-faced as he explains through the Farsi translator that they are worried as the child won’t drink and looks tired. He has heard that another child from a nearby tent is now in hospital in Athens with a brain infection. He looks at the floor, apologises for attending, but asks for help.Just as I start examining the child, I can hear shouting and the sound of someone being dragged along the gravel outside. The support crew member on the back door shouts “red patient” and I move the febrile child into the back space of the cabin, pulling the bed out and making space for the emergency. He is a young man in his teens, unconscious, dragged in a dark grey blanket by four people from the surrounding tents. He was seen to be shouting and screaming and then collapsed, breathing very heavily and not waking up. The men have been running with him unconscious in the blanket for 10 minutes to reach the medical area.I start the tests on him. As I go to inflate the blood pressure cuff, he opens his eyes and screams – a long, sustained scream, followed by extreme hyperventilation and rigidity in his arms. This is a classic picture of a panic attack associated with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), and a common presentation to the clinic. We are fortunate to have a psychiatric nurse in our team, and once any more sinister pathology is excluded, we move the man to a back room to rest and be reviewed by her, to plan onward referral and care.In terms of mental health help for refugees, there are currently two referral pathways for the more severe end of the spectrum, but each takes time and depends on exposure to violence, sexual violence, and previous history. In the acute phase we provide emergency care for these patients and their friends, relatives and tent-mates, who listen to them cry at night, and drag them to the clinic in blankets when they have attacks.Despite seeing multiple patients suffering with panic attacks every day, the sound of the screams still shocks and chills me as I wonder: what have you seen? What are you still seeing? I can’t comprehend it. And when we send them back to their tents, I feel ashamed.I continue, with the help of my translator, to see patients in the “yellow” queue, mostly children with fevers, adults with abdominal pain, pregnant women, minors with scabies. We are busy today, as we are every day there are a lot of people to see. As the sun goes down, I always feel the atmosphere at triage and inside the clinic changes. I get a sense of desperation and hostility, not usually played out, but always at the back of my mind. Because there is no electricity in the camp, the darkness outside is engulfing. Our clinic runs on the grid, regularly tripping out, and we carry out our consultations by the glow of head torches and battery-operated lights.An entire family is dragged in, two of the four children unconscious and the father appearing confused, shouting about “fire”. Apparently they went to a neighbour’s tent where a fire was lit for warmth after sundown, and have been exposed to carbon monoxide for a sustained period of time. We start oxygen from our transported cylinders on the children who are not responding, wrap them in emergency blankets, and call the ambulance, while checking over the others. We have only two oxygen tanks so rotate them in response to clinical need. The ambulance will not drive up to the clinic (a short distance from the front gate of the camp) for safety reasons after dark unless in extreme emergencies, so we run the children down to the ambulance when it arrives, connecting their masks to the oxygen in the ambulance and sending them on their way. They have started responding by the time they are in the ambulance, and we know they will be OK.The hubbub created by another “red” patient draws close and echoes around outside the clinic. This time two young men from the sections for unaccompanied minors are dragged in between friends, gasping and covered in blood. Both have been stabbed in the chest. One stabbing like this in London would receive emergency trauma care from a highly trained team, probably in a major trauma centre. In Moria, this is not the case.I call all five doctors and the emergency nurse to the cabin and we split into teams, with two translators at each bedside. The majority of doctors are not used to dealing with acute stabbings: BRF has not actively recruited for emergency doctors previously, as we were offering more clinic-based urgent care. We had gone through some team pre-hospital trauma care earlier in the week and have had daily exposure to stabbings by now, so we get to work putting in lines and assessing each patient. We now have only one oxygen tank as we used the other on the children with carbon monoxide poisoning.We prioritise the boy with the central chest stab as he appears to be having repeated apnoeic episodes. As we wait for the ambulance to arrive, the other one starts to gargle and choke. One of his lungs is filling up with air and blood where he has been stabbed. We switch the oxygen tank to him, while stabilising the other boy’s bleeding, and plan how to extricate both on stretchers from the tiny clinic room. We put in an emergency needle to decompress the damaged lung. It works for a few minutes, then fills with blood again. We decide to decompress that side of his chest with a cut to his chest wall. The tension is released, for now. The translators – non-medical but now accustomed to this type of emergency – grab oxygen masks, gauze and cannula dressings, and squeeze in fluid like members of a trained trauma team. Their resilience and care for their fellow refugees nearly chokes me.As the ambulance arrives, we beg them to come down to the clinic gates to minimise the time transferring the boys in the freezing cold. They agree and also agree to take both boys at the same time – a rare occurrence, but last week a young man died from a stab wound and we work together in the dark shadow of this memory. We take the boys out in emergency blankets, with fluids and lines in place, on stretchers, in front of the patients waiting to be seen in the cold, gravel-floored cage that is the waiting room. I go back to debrief the team the translators are already cleaning the blood from the floor, beds and walls.We see the next patients. We keep going. People keep arriving and we continue to try to keep them safe in whatever capacity we can.At the end of our clinic time, the responsibility for the medical care of patients in the camp is down to a lone “army doctor”, who cannot be accessed by patients unless the police deem them to have a serious enough medical problem. Unless there is a life-threatening emergency, they will wait until the day clinic opens at nine. People queue in the dark from 6:30 to try to get help.This is not abnormal. This is daily. The next day we had a 16-year-old boy, again from the supposedly protected sections, fall through the back doors of the clinic with a knife still in his back. On the last night I was working we saw four life-threatening stabbings, including a stabbed neck and an open chest. We assessed and stabilised them all and got them to hospital. As far as I’m aware, all of these patients are still alive.There has been no electricity in the camp now for two and a half months. We know about the direct correlation between light and crime – people have been requesting an end to this darkness. It has not come.The sections for unaccompanied minors and vulnerable women consist of fenced areas with sleeping cabins inside, locked in a secure area near to the police and new arrivals areas. They are understaffed. s work hard to keep the most vulnerable safe, but with boredom and violence still prevalent, and staff often not speaking the same language as the refugees, monitoring and care is stretched, and problems continue to spiral. With finite space and an infinite number of increasingly vulnerable people arriving, many minors and women are living alone outside the sections, at risk of abuse, violence, and systemic failings.The boredom in the camp is maddening and the asylum process is opaque. Even those of us with contacts in other NGOs and with lawyers cannot work it out. During my time there, one of our most calm, loyal, and impressive translators was arrested after a second rejection and deported without papers, and without a lawyer. We have still not been able to contact him. We do not know where he is and we do not know the details of his rejection. We know he will not be safe back in Afghanistan. This kind of thing reaches through the camp, adding to the feeling of resignation and hopelessness. And the madness continues.The suffering is palpable, the hopelessness is insidious, the feeling of abandonment is all-consuming. I have not done a special job here. I have gone to volunteer, as many have before me and many continue to do while I return to my home, where I have central heating, regular food I can choose, and my freedom – and all of these afforded to me only by my luck at birth.Moria refugee camp is at breaking point the situation is about to implode. This will happen inwardly, harming some of the most vulnerable people in the world. The implosion will probably cause a tiny ripple of outward explosion, and then be forgotten. The world continues to turn its back. We must open the conversation once more, we must consider taking responsibility for our fellow humans. I have no solution, but I want to give a voice to these silenced people, and hope there is a willing audience prepared to begin to listen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5626b97c918ffd6548a75688bc2fc8952beebea/0_247_3210_1927/master/3210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bb9d7c200a052675a231817d45a8014","title":"sinn fein to try to form ruling coalition after irish election success","story":"Party disrupts Ireland’s centrist tradition by taking almost a quarter of votesSinn Féin will try to form a government in Ireland after apparently winning more votes than any other party in Saturday’s general election – a historic result that upended the political system.The party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told cheering supporters on Sunday that a “revolution” had occurred and she would try to form a ruling coalition with other parties. “This is no longer a two-party system,” she said.Sinn Féin, once a pariah for its IRA links, won almost a quarter of first-preference votes, possibly pipping Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, two centrist rivals that have taken turns ruling Ireland for a century.It rode a wave of anger over homelessness, soaring rents and hospital waiting lists as well as disillusionment with the traditional political duopoly.McDonald, speaking over rapturous, deafening chants at a Dublin count centre, said she had spoken to the Greens and small leftwing parties in hope of forming a coalition without Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil – an unlikely scenario. She did not rule out a deal with either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.Parliamentary arithmetic may exclude Sinn Féin from power, however. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael ran more candidates and are expected to each win more seats than Sinn Féin in the 160-seat Dáil Éireann, the Irish parliament’s lower chamber, leaving unclear which parties – if any – will be able to form a viable coalition. Deadlock could lead to another election.During the campaign Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, and Micheál Martin, the leader of Fianna Fáil, both ruled out entering government with Sinn Féin, citing ethical and policy reasons.Varadkar, Ireland’s first gay taoiseach, had hoped a healthy economy and his record on Brexit would deliver a third term for Fine Gael, but he encountered voter fatigue and anger over the cost of living and state of public services. Varadkar’s party colleague Richard Bruton, the outgoing environment minister, said Fine Gael’s poor but not disastrous results gave it a chance of forming another government.Asked if Fianna Fáil would now consider sharing power with Fine Gael or Sinn Féin, Martin appeared to leave the door ajar, citing a need for stability amid political fragmentation. “The country comes first … there is an onus and an obligation on all that such a functioning government is formed after this.”Many in Fianna Fáil, stung by the backlash over their confidence-and-supply deal with Varadkar’s outgoing government, would prefer a deal with Sinn Féin than another centrist alliance.Ireland’s single transferrable vote system of proportional representation means it could be Monday, Tuesday or even later before all Dáil seats are allocated.It was a stunning result for Sinn Féin, which was the IRA’s political wing during the Troubles and remained a fringe party in the republic until well after the 1998 Good Friday agreement.Preliminary vote tallies suggested Sinn Féin could win around 36 seats, up from 22 in the outgoing Dáil, far exceeding its own expectations.Many candidates ratcheted up huge surpluses in urban heartlands while others appeared on course for unexpected victories in Galway, Tipperary, Roscommon, Mayo and Wexford.Gerry Adams, who stepped down as party leader in 2018 and as a Dáil member in this election, credited McDonald’s leadership and said he had not foreseen the extent of the gains. He said Sinn Féin would use its mandate to plan for a united Ireland – a defining tenet for the party.The issue barely featured in the campaign, but an exit poll of voters found most supporting a border poll in the next five years. Sceptics say that could destabilise both sides of the island. Unionist leaders in Northern Ireland gave no immediate response to the results south of the border.People across the political spectrum said the election was seismic, even if its consequences remained unclear. The former Labour leader Pat Rabbitte said a tectonic shift had killed the old system of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael alternating in power with Labour or other small, establishment parties.The commentator Fintan O’Toole wrote in the  that young voters had shattered the taboo of backing a party associated with terrorism. “They have gone where they were warned not to go and in doing so they have redrawn the map of Irish politics to include territory previously marked ‘here be dragons’.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84b2f43fac4b68715e0e6d424929091177c15bad/0_298_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0edb737c5b9ba1800a2e416fb1750d3","title":"uk universities in china face shutdown over coronavirus","story":"British universities are braced for a long shutdown of their Chinese campuses after Beijing said it would extend the closure of China’s higher education sector into March to combat the spread of coronavirus.Nottingham, Birmingham City and Leeds universities were among the many UK higher education providers told they must delay the return of academics and students until 2 March, after they were initially told to keep their Chinese offshoots closed until 24 February.The decision to extend the shutdown of higher education throughout China until next month is expected to be a clear signal to other parts of the country’s education system to prolong the winter break, which started in December and includes the lunar new year, until the virus is under control.Beijing has allowed local authorities to use their own judgment about when to open schools and locally controlled universities later this month, but the move to extend the closure of centrally funded and regulated universities, which includes foreign-owned campuses, is expected to persuade most local officials to follow Beijing’s lead.More than 35,000 people in China and 24 other countries have contracted the virus, and hundreds have died. The Beijing authorities have effectively quarantined a string of cities stretching from Wuhan, where the outbreak started, to the east coast and asked anyone who suspects they have flu-like symptoms to seek medical attention.Most major airlines have suspended flights to China, and governments in the region have blocked Chinese nationals from leaving the country. The US, Australia and Singapore have blocked all foreign visitors who have recently been to China. Some 30,000 Britons in mainland China have been advised to leave, although it is unclear whether they will be allowed to travel with their spouses. The last government-chartered repatriation flight out of Wuhan is due to depart on Sunday.City streets and shopping malls in China have largely been deserted for the last two weeks, leading western retailers to shut their stores. Apple, which relies on China for about a fifth of its store sales, has closed its shops and offices until further notice. Starbucks closed almost half of its 4,300 outlets in China, leading to a dramatic fall in the price of coffee on international markets.The upmarket fashion retailer Burberry said wealthy Chinese consumers were staying away from its Chinese shops and travel restrictions had curbed overseas shopping sprees, leading to a dramatic loss of business.Cuts in factory production across the country’s industrial heartland have also pushed down the price of oil from almost $70 for a barrel of Brent crude a month ago to $54 last week.In the last week, the car firm Fiat Chrysler has warned that it will need to shut one of its European factories unless the virus is brought under control and shipments of vital parts and electronic components are restarted from Chinese ports.She said the university would be able to cope with a degree of disruption over the coming months. “The university has longstanding contingency arrangements to amend semester dates and provide additional learning resources and support through online methods.”Birmingham City University has 1,000 Chinese students at its joint venture with Wuhan Textile University – the Birmingham Institute of Fashion and Creative Art. A spokesman said: “Wuhan Textile University was closed for the lunar new year, and its reopening will be a matter for our Chinese partners. We are in close communication with our partners and the UK government to understand the impact on our students.”Liverpool University has a joint venture with Xi’an Jiaotong University, which has 32,000 students and is based north-east of Wuhan.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, a third person was diagnosed with it in Brighton, and a fourth is being treated in London, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can. Five new cases in France are British nationals, and British nationals are also among the 64 cases on a cruise liner off Japan.The number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by World Health Organization (WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.Another key unknown, of which scientists should get a clearer idea in the coming weeks, is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.Anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last two weeks and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath should stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild, the NHS advises.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":null,"title":"clare results electoral shock as violet ann wynne to top poll","story":"The completed tally in Clare has Sinn Fein’s Violet Ann Wynne topping the poll with almost 8,700 first preference votes.The tally puts the west Clare woman on course to cause a major electoral shock in the four seater with 15 per cent of the vote.Ms Wynne ran for the local elections in the west Clare area last May polling only 4.2 per cent of the vote with 385 votes before an early elimination.The completed tally – apart from a missing Kilmaley box – has Ms Wynne on 8,692 votes.With 179 of the 180 boxes tallied, Fianna Fåil has secured 34 per cent of the vote.Cllr Cathal Crowe (FF) is party’s best performing tallying 8,144 votes and followed by running mate, Timmy Dooley at 7,611.Former Labour TD and independent candidate, Michael McNamara has performed strongly across the county capturing a tallied 7,228 first preferences.

Video: Bryan O’Brien\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald at the RDS count centre in Dublin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsSinn Féin looks poised to win at least 10 extra seats in the 33rd Dáil as it benefits from a dramatic surge in support from the voters in the general election.While it remains unclear whether it will ultimately be part of any future coalition, the support gained by Mary Lou McDonald’s party has sent shockwaves across the Irish political landscape. As counting continues in the 39 constituencies, Ms McDonald said she has been in touch with the Greens, Social Democrats and People Before Profit to arrange government formation talks.Speaking at the RDS, she said she wants to explore whether such a new government would be possible.“I also have consistently said that I will talk to and listen to everybody, I think that is what grown-ups do and that is what democracy demands.”She said she was not shocked by the countrywide surge in support and acknowledged that the party should have fielded more candidates.“It is a big statement of change. This is no longer a two-party system. People want a different type of government.”The party’s housing spokesman, Eoin Ó Broin, later said housing was one of the biggest issues on doorsteps around the country and was a major contributor to the success of Sinn Féin in the election.Former party leader Gerry Adams said he had been confident Sinn Féin would hold its seats in the Dáil but had not foreseen the extent of its success this year.However, on Sunday evening Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he will not be speaking to Sinn Féin with a view to forming a coalition after the election. Speaking at his count centre in Dublin, he said his party Fine Gael was “not compatible with Sinn Féin”.Congratulating Ms McDonald and her party on their success, he said they had done very well “but bear in mind we have roughly three parties that got roughly the same share of the vote . . . and everyone’s mandate needs to be respected”.He said “nobody can be forced into some sort of forced marriage or forced coalition”.To form a government together “you need to have roughly the same views around the courts of the criminal justice system, around how the economy and society should be run and also how democracy should function and that’s what makes my party Fine Gael not compatible with Sinn Féin”. Despite its surge, the odds remain against Sinn Féin emerging with the most seats, primarily because it ran significantly fewer candidates than its two main rivals – 42 compared to Fianna Fáil’s 84 and Fine Gael’s 82. ‘Pole position’Outgoing Fine Gael Minister Richard Bruton said he believed Fine Gael will be in “pole position” to form a government after the votes are counted. Fine Gael’s Simon Harris said his party is still willing to talk about a grand coalition with Fianna Fáil. While the party’s first preference was to form a government with other parties such as Labour and the Greens, Mr Harris said a coalition with Fianna Fáil was still an option, “as a last resort, in the national interest”.Mr Martin refused to be drawn on the possibility that Fianna Fáil would enter into coalition with Sinn Féin, though he did stress all political parties would have to listen to what the electorate have said.Sinn Féin’s Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire was the first elected TD of the 33rd Dáil. He topped the poll in Cork South-Central with 14,057 votes, beating Mr Martin and Tánaiste Simon Coveney in the constituency.Sinn Féin gainsTallies indicate that Sinn Féin can make gains in 12 constituencies, with the possibility of gaining seats in one or two more. That will take its Dáil representation to beyond 30 seats for the first time, a historic high for the party. In contrast, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are unlikely to make any material gains. The prospects of any combination of parties reaching a majority of 80 seats to form a government now looks remote, unless there are fundamental shifts in terms of declared positions on coalition partners. An illustration of the level of Sinn Féin’s support has been the huge personal votes amassed by key party figures including Ms McDonald, David Cullinane, Pearse Doherty, Dessie Ellis, and Aengus Ó Snodaigh, all of whom received between 1½ and two quotas each. Party strategists have said if it had run second candidates in some constituencies its total would have reached 40.In contrast, neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael look in a position to make anticipated gains, with many of the parties’ seats in danger.Among the well-known figures who have already lost their seats is Minister for Transport Shane Ross, who was eliminated from the count in Dublin Rathdown. Meanwhile, Minister for Children Katherine Zappone is vulnerable in Dublin South-West. Former Labour leader Joan Burton seems certain to lose her seat in Dublin West, where Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly has topped the poll ahead of Mr Varadkar. Sinn Féin made an unexpected gain in Wexford with the election of Johnny Mythen and in Mayo with the election of Rose Conway-Walsh, who became the first Sinn Féin candidate to be elected to the Dáil there since 1927. According to the tallies, the party could make further surprise gains in constituencies including Tipperary Roscommon-Galway, and both Kildare constituencies. Counting of votes cast in Saturday’s ballot began at 9am on Sunday.Exit pollAn Ipsos MRBI exit poll published on Saturday night indicated Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin were set for an extraordinary tie in their share of the vote. The poll was taken on Saturday at 250 locations across the State, among 5,376 respondents who had just voted. It has a margin of error of 1.3 per cent.The uncertainty created by the exit poll had thrown up the possibility of another general election being necessary.

People can’t get their head around that. It is simply wrong, but it is government policy” she said.“The fact that for nine years they didn’t build a single public house in Galway city, that has repercussions. There are huge amounts looking for a social house, there are those who cannot afford their rent and there are people who have no prospect of getting a mortgage. I am 30-years-old and for my friends the prospect of owning their own home is a wild dream.”It was also a good election for outgoing independent TD Noel Grealish who polled 8,043 first preference votes. The controversy over his comments about African migrants being “spongers” do not seem to have harmed his chances with the voters.There is very little between the Fine Gael candidates Hildegarde Naughton (5,609) and her running mate Seán Kyne (5,284) with Naughton likely to get the fourth seat.Independent TD Catherine Connolly is favourite to get the last seat and edge out Fianna Fáil’s Cllr Ollie Burke.

In this 2016 video featuring the late Noel Whelan, we explain how it works. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAt least half the ballot papers cast on Saturday will not be counted beyond the number one. File photograph: CollinsOur single transferrable vote system of proportional representation – or\u0026nbspPR-STV – is one of the most flexible and subtle systems anywhere in the world. It enables voters to support the candidate or party they like best, even if they have little or no chance of being elected, and then using their preferences to ensure that their vote moves on to a candidate with a real chance of making it to the Dáil. While it is not strictly proportional it is much fairer than the straight vote system in the UK or the US.Should you vote all the way down the ballot paper?Yes. To maximise the impact of your vote it is best to give every candidate a preference. Give your first preference to the candidate you most want to see elected and then in descending order of preference down to the one you like least.You don’t have to do this and can stop at whatever point you want and your vote will still be valid but to have maximum impact it is best to use all your preferences. The key thing to remember is that a lower preference can never interfere with a higher one. Your number two will only come into play if your first preference is eliminated or elected and so on.So how does the system work?From a voter’s perspective STV is very simple. Just rank the candidates in order of your choice starting with 1. The counting of votes is a different matter and can appear very complicated to the uninitiated. The first thing to understand is that a quota is set for each constituency depending on the number of seats to be filled and the number of people who have voted. The quota is arrived at by iding the number of valid votes by the number of seats plus one, and then adding one to the resulting total.For instance if 40,000 votes are cast in a three-seat constituency the quota would be calculated by iding the number of votes by four and then adding one making it 10,001. The formula means that no more than three people can reach the quota.How do transfers work?After the first count when all the number ones have been counted the first thing to happen is that the surplus votes of a successful candidate who has exceeded the quota will be distributed. This is done by checking the second preferences on all the ballot papers of the candidate and distributing his or her number twos in proportion.When all the first-count surpluses have been distributed the returning officer will then move on to eliminating the candidate with the lowest number of votes. The number twos will be counted and allocated to the other candidates. The next lowest will be eliminated and so on until there are only three candidates left for the three seats.But where does a number four or five or even lower preference come in?As the counts progress a vote that was cast for a candidate eliminated early in the count will move on to the number two. If that candidate is eliminated in turn it will go on to number three and so on. If the candidate getting the number two is already elected or eliminated the vote will move on to the next available candidate still in the race.There is a complication about distributing the surplus of a candidate elected after the first count with the help of transfers. Instead of counting all of the candidate’s votes to allocate the next available preference, only the last bundles of votes received are counted to see where the next preferences goes.What is meant by tactical voting?One way of voting tactically is that by going all the way down the ballot paper you can support the candidate or party you want with high preferences while attempting to stop the ones you like least by putting them at the very end.Another way of voting tactically is that where a party is running more than one candidate, committed supporters are advised to give the number one to the weakest candidate on the ticket to maximise the party’s chances of winning more than one seat. If the candidate is eliminated, the vote will not be wasted as the next preference will automatically be counted.Are all the preferences on all ballot papers counted?No. At least half the ballot papers cast on Saturday will not be counted beyond the number one. If the number one goes to a candidate who is in contention for a seat but does not exceed the quota at any stage the second preference will not be counted. Many of the seats will be filled by candidates who fall just short of a quota on the final count. Even if a candidate exceeds the quota after the first count only a small proportion of the next preferences will be counted as part of a surplus.What is a spoiled vote?A small proportion of votes are spoiled in every election because the voter has not clearly indicated a preference. This sometimes happens because a number 1 is given to more than one candidate. Often votes are spoiled on purpose with slogans written on the ballot paper by disgruntled voters.Is the STV system or PR a uniquely Irish one?No. It was imposed on this country as part of the Home Rule Act in 1912 and later incorporated in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 with the objective of protecting the unionist minority and ensuring they had representation in an Irish parliament. The system was later included in de Valera’s 1937 constitution and two attempts to abolish it, in 1959 and 1966, were rejected by the electorate. The same system is used in Malta, the Australian senate and Northern Ireland Assembly.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Lady Gaga lost the Oscar to Olivia Colman — a real actor’s actor.”The voter added that an actor’s reputation in Hollywood circles can decide a category more than their actual performance, and that many Academy members will not watch all the films up for nomination.He told the New York Post: “Unfortunately, actors become brands. Sandler’s brand doesn’t scream Oscar, but Leo DiCaprio’s and Jonathan Pryce’s do.”Carey Mulligan agreed, and argued that the 8,000 members of the Academy should have to prove that they had seen the films in their category. Each member is allowed to vote in their section – be it acting, make up, editing and so on.Unlike the Tony Awards, for Broadway shows, there is no requirement to prove you have seen the films you are deciding between.Mulligan, nominated for an Oscar in 2010 for An Education, said that forcing all voting members to watch the films would mean more recognition for female directors.“I don’t think you can watch those films and not think they deserve recognition,” she said. “I think they need to be watched. Maybe you shouldn’t be allowed to vote unless you can prove you’ve seen every single one. There should be a test. The films that did get left out are indisputably brilliant.”No women were nominated for best director, and only one non-white person received recognition for acting.Author Stephen King sided with Mulligan, writing about concerns of bias among Academy members, who may choose not to see certain films they were asked to decide upon.“Here’s another piece of the puzzle. Voters are supposed to look at all films in serious contention. This year, that would be about 60,” he wrote in The Washington Post. “There’s no way of checking how many voters actually do, because viewing is on the honour system.“How many of the older, whiter contingent actually saw Harriet, about Harriet Tubman, or The Last Black Man in San Francisco? Just asking the question. If they did see all the films, were they moved by what they saw? Did they feel the catharsis that’s the basis of all that artists aspire to? Did they understand?”Amy Pascal, producer of Little Women, noted that twice as many women than men attended early screenings of the film, suggesting that male voters were skipping it.Voters think that these kinds of stories are important to me, and these kinds of stories are less important to me,” she said.The situation is not new. In 92 years, only five women have been nominated for best director, and only one has ever won – Kathryn Bigelow, in 2010, with The Hurt Locker.Yet is it causing increasing concern, as the 2015 “Oscars So White” campaign and the #MeToo movement born out of Harvey Weinstein’s 2016 downfall fade in the memory, seemingly having had little impact.The failure to nominate women is not a reflection of their commercial clout.Women made up 10.6 per cent of the directors of the top 100 grossing movies from 2019, according to the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative - the highest since the institute began tracking the data in 2007.Israeli-American director Alma Har’el, whose film Honey Boy was highly acclaimed on the festival circuit, suggested creating two director awards, in male and female categories.The status quo will always protect itself by getting women and underrepresented filmmakers to play a game they can’t win - by making us believe that anything other than breaking into the white boys’ club is failure,” she said.She said a new category would “build a new world that celebrates us.”Industry activists are taking matters into their own hands.Give Her a Break, a charity, has launched an online portal to the Oscars live stream that will flip during the ad breaks to showcase female-directed films. It will then switch back to the Oscars when the awards show resumes.“They stole our Oscars. So we stole their ads,” the campaign promotion reads.Gerwig, whose boyfriend Noah Baumbach is nominated for best director for Marriage Story, remains sanguine about the situation.“I think that the directors branch could probably stand to bolster its lady numbers,” she said.“This will go to the top of my to-do list!”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wuhan evacuees arrive uk two week isolation two britons test","story":"Around 200 evacuees will remain in complete isolation for two weeks in Milton Keynes after the second and final flight from the Chinese city of Wuhan landed in the UK.Passengers were taken to the Kents Hill Park hotel and conference centre in the Bedfordshire town, where, unlike the first tranche of evacuees, they will not be allowed to socialise in a bid to reduce the chance of a coronavirus outbreak.Two Britons who had expected to board the flight in China were prevented from doing so following last-minute medical checksOne told Sky News: “Now we are stranded in Wuhan having missed the last plane out of Wuhan and our last means of evacuation.”It came as two more Britons were diagnosed with the illness yesterday, both of whom contracted it in the French Alps via a British “super spreader”.One man tested positive after returning to his home near Palma, Majorca, while the other had returned to the UK and is being treated at the Royal Free hospital in north west London.As the worldwide death toll continued to rise, members of the public appealed for information about the movements of those who may have unwittingly passed on the virus.Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology at Imperial College London, warned of the “potential risk of a pandemic”.“The concern is the potential for the silent transmissions to go unrecognised until they are brought into the open by people developing illness from onward transmission,” he said.Prof Tedder noted an “uncomfortable similarity” with the emergence of HIV in the 1980s due to its ability to be transmitted by people showing no symptoms and called for diagnostic testing for antibodies.“Without that we are truly flying blind if it is the case that the coronavirus can be transmitted by those without symptoms,” he added.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, said the repatriation flight from Wuhan had brought back 105 British nationals and family members, as well as 95 European nationals and family members.One of the two Brits remaining in Wuhan says he was denied access to the last Government-chartered flight back to the UK after failing a temperature check because he was wearing two jackets.Josh Skarratts said he had worn a hoodie and a jacket to try and comply with hand luggage weight requirements and in preparation for cold weather in the UK.But when his temperature was taken from underneath his armpits, the reading of 37.5C (99.5F) was deemed too high by officials in the Chinese city.The comedy club owner said another Briton was turned away for the same reason.Now we are stranded in Wuhan having missed the last plane out of Wuhan and our last means of evacuation, he told Sky News.It\u0027s quite a difficult pill to swallow when you know the exact reason why you weren\u0027t allowed on the plane could have been avoided.Mr Skarratts added that he is confident the Foreign Office and the British Embassy will help him and the other Briton to leave Wuhan.The evacuees are believed to have only hand luggage with them. The NHS is providing welcome packs with toiletries and basic clothing. Yesterday, staff were seen carrying armfuls of clothes from Primark into the Milton Keynes conference centre.Couples and families were allocated two rooms each and were given access to Netflix, magazines, books, baby equipment including highchairs, children\u0027s toys and games, mobile phones, and tablets for reading, games, and internet.Health officials were concerned about catering arrangements and suggested delivering meals to people\u0027s rooms instead of having a communal facility. A source close to South Central Ambulance Service said patients would be confined to their rooms. Milton Keynes Council said local schools had been alerted and were working to “update and reassure parents.The first group of Britons who returned on a flight last month are continuing their quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital, Merseyside.Meanwhile, in France, the five Britons diagnosed with coronavirus were being monitored at a hospital in Grenoble.They include Bob Saynor, 48 and his nine-year-old son as well as three members of a party of seven adults who regularly stayed with the family at their chalet in the Alpine resort area of Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc.Mr Saynor’s mother, Jean, told the  he was doing “fine” and that she understood no-one was “seriously ill”.All five had come into contact with a middle-aged businessman from Brighton who had contracted the virus in Singapore.Last night, health authorities arranged an emergency public meeting in the neighbouring town of Saint Gervais, to quell any anguish in the area. “Don’t panic. There is no reason to worry about local life. You cannot catch it on the street. You cannot catch it on the pistes,” said one official. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/06/14/beetroot-leaf-dhal-cooking-indyeats.jpg","title":"garden sustainable space how to build tips tricks climate 20 pledges","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.This year, Chris Riotta is growing his own fruit and vegetables – in the middle of New York CityWhether you’re working with a few feet of space in a community vegetable patch, or have 65 acres of luscious foliage on a sprawling estate (looking at you, Oprah Winfrey), the first step to building a sustainable garden is mapping out a vision of your intentions.Each year before planting my own vegetable patch, I draw out an image of the garden I hope to build, indicating where each plant should go based on available sunlight and shading.\u0026nbspI’m currently planning to build the largest garden I’ve ever grown, while working to harvest one-third of my annual vegetable consumption directly from my backyard, as part of my mission for The Independent’s 20\u0026nbspPledges\u0026nbspfor 2020 initiative. While mapping out the garden, I put together a few tips and tricks to help get you started on your own sustainable vegetable patch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPlan out where to place your\u0026nbspplantsRoot to fruit: How to join the ethical food revolutionI like to plant crops that grow on vines (think: cucumbers and cherry tomatoes) in small groups, as close to a fence as possible so they scale upwards, while giving other plants that will likely grow much larger a separate space off to the side. That way, I can still walk by and tend to the crops growing up the fence, no matter how big the other plants off to the side eventually grow.\u0026nbspThis also works with smaller plots of soil like community garden space: keep clusters of similar plants in the same tight groups, and don’t worry so much about spacing. With some proper TLC, plants usually find their way around each other in the dirt.\u0026nbspSeeds can always begin growing indoors ahead of the season around the time you lay out your soil, which will provide you with plenty of time to start growing your crops in a stable environment. Some farmers will recommend you transport these seeds to your garden based on the location of the moon, but since I don’t have time for all that, I simply give the soil a good rinse of water for a week before transporting or planting anything in my garden.Study your plotBefore stepping into that dirt, it’s important to study your space and gain an understanding of how many hours of sunlight you’re working with and what kind of plants grow well in the region. Most will require about eight hours of sun, but if you’re in a shaded area and can only get six, that should still work, as many plants favour partial shade and only require about four hours of direct sunlight.\u0026nbspGetting a head start on laying out the groundwork for your garden will help it produce sustainable harvests that last throughout the summer months – and then some. You can look up the last frost date in your region here.\u0026nbspI tend to lay out my organic soil exactly where I plant to grow my garden about six weeks before this date.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Back to our roots: Warming winter vegetables recipes Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Maximise your spaceIt’s also just as important to consider ways to maximise the space while gardening. Vertical garden walls can be purchased or made easily in DIY projects, allowing plants to grow above each other rather than spread out over a small space.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailLastly, don’t be afraid to plant intensively. Most crops only need a few inches of space for their roots to grow: things like peppers, tomatoes, broccoli and kale can all grow much closer together than most people think. I tend to believe that crops grow better when they’re in close, clustered mixes of similar plants, but that’s just my unprofessional semi-gardening enthusiast opinion.Transplant the seeds to your garden once its warm enough for them to survive in an outdoor climate, but only when the seeds are busting out of their trays or starter pots. The seeds should look vibrant and almost too big for their trays by the time they are brought to the garden for planting.\u0026nbspI tend to believe the first moments catering to a garden and each inidual plant are some of the most important in a life cycle the only way a garden will produce healthy crops is with tender love and care during its birth. These moments of transporting, growing the seeds, placing them into the ground and giving them nutrients and fresh water throughout the process are all vital to the longevity of a harvest.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

From there, you\u0027ll see the normal list of everyone you follow, but also the new update.There is an option for looking at the Instagram accounts that appear most in your feed. Those are also likely to be the ones you interact with most, given that Instagram prizes things like likes when deciding what to show, but could also be annoying accounts that post too much.The other option shows users who they interact with least. That can include dozens of people that might be worth unfollowing if their feed or stories are becoming overwhelming.The new feature was found in testing late last year, but has finally rolled out to everyone with a new update and announcement from Instagram.It comes after the app also added the option to see the people you follow sorted by how recently you started doing so. That is similarly intended to allow people to better understand their feed, and get rid of anyone they followed a long time ago but no longer wish to see posts from.Selena Gomez says Instagram is ‘destroying’ some of her generationAll of the features are intended to allow people to have more control of their news feed and hopefully better curate what they want to see.“Instagram is really about bringing you closer to the people and things you care about — but we know that over time, your interests and relationships can evolve and change,” a spokesperson said.“Whether you graduate, move to a new city, or become obsessed with a new interest and find a community, we want to make it easier to manage the accounts you follow on Instagram so that they best represent your current connections and interests.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They can also be profoundly illuminating, offering us our only chance to get close to rock taken from a whole separate world.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It\u0027s the first time a lunar sample has been studied like this. We\u0027re using a technique many geologists haven\u0027t even heard of.Scientists to make air out of lunar dust amid plans to live on MoonAs researchers make use of the new technique, they expect to find a vast set of new information about the lunar surface.We can apply this technique to samples no one has studied, Philipp Heck, a curator at the Field Museum, associate professor at the University of Chicago, and co-author of the paper, adds. You\u0027re almost guaranteed to find something new or unexpected.This technique has such high sensitivity and resolution, you find things you wouldn\u0027t find otherwise and only use up a small bit of the sample.The technique is called atom probe tomography, and involves incredibly precise manipulation of inidual grains. It has previously been used in industrial processes – but the new breakthrough has come in turning it for the first time to lunar samples.It works something like nanocarpentry, said Professor Heck: like a carpenter shapes wood, we do it at the nanoscale to minerals.The sample is placed inside a special probe and then shot with a laser that knocks off inidual atoms, which then fall onto a special plate. Researchers can examine those elements by timing how long they take to hit the detector – since heavier ones take longer – and so the type of atom can be worked out.It has already helped researchers see the weathering and materials that can be found inside the lunar soil. That in turn could help future astronauts as they move to live on the Moon, since they could survive by taking resources out of that dust.The researchers now hope they can get hold of samples from elsewhere on the Moon, and elsewhere in space, to allow them to better understand the makeup of the worlds that surround us. They compare our current understanding to analysing Earth using only one mountain range – to get a fuller grasp, they will need to examine a variety of terrains across the solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a depressing fact that films directed by previous winners have more chance of being nominated than those directed by newcomers.Because of this, the\u0026nbspbest film in any given year almost never wins the evening’s most coveted prize – in fact, it’s sometimes\u0026nbspnot even\u0026nbspnominated in the first place.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOver the decades, there have been countless glaring omissions\u0026nbsp– films that were nominated but were beaten by far inferior films\u0026nbspand classic films\u0026nbspthat failed to secure a single nomination.As the 2020 Oscars approach – a ceremony that’s fast becoming a two-horse race between a film that actually deserves the top prize (Parasite) and a film that does not (1917) – we’ve run through 20 brilliant films that you would have expected to be a\u0026nbspBest Picture winner, but weren’t.Click through the bellow gallery to see what films made the listCreated with Sketch.Oscars: 21 great films that never won Best Picture Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Long revered as one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles\u0027 debut – a film following newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane – was just another nominee back in the day, losing out to How Green Was My Valley. The Searchers may be considered John Ford\u0027s greatest film, but it was not treated as such back in the 1950s. In fact, the western starring John Wayne failed to earn a single nomination. Around the World in 80 Days turned out to be more the Academy\u0027s cup of tea.Not only did Alfred Hitchcock never win an Oscar (save for his memorial award in 1968), but neither did any of his films – one of which is Vertigo, a classic that won Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s once-a-decade greatest films of all time poll in 2012. If it had been nominated, it would have faced stiff competition in the form of eventual winner All About Eve.One of the films that kickstarted the New Hollywood Cinema era, The Graduate may have won director Mike Nichols an Oscar, but it ultimately lost out to Norman Jewison\u0027s In the Heat of the Night.  Stanley Kubrick\u0027s sci-fi classic remains one of the most influential pieces of cinema there is. The Academy didn\u0027t agree. The Academy nominated Kubrick for Best Director and awarded the visual effects in favour of considering 2001 for Best Picture (it didn\u0027t even get nominated). That year\u0027s winner was Oliver!, the musical by Carol Reed.Despite Taxi Driver\u0027s failure to win the main award, its nomination in four categories showed the Academy had good intentions. That All the President\u0027s Men and Network also lost out to eventual winner Rocky shows that, ultimately, it never really stood a chance.Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s ambitious Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now received a grand total of eight nominations, but only went home with two prizes (for cinematography and sound) losing out to drama Kramer vs. Kramer.Of all the Oscar blows dealt to Martin Scorsese over the decades, none landed harder than Raging Bull losing out to Robert Redford\u0027s weepie Ordinary People, an oversight many consider one of the Academy\u0027s most egregious.  Another sci-fi classic overlooked by the Oscars was Blade Runner, which didn\u0027t even get nominated in the Best Picture category (Gandhi ended up winning). Ridley Scott\u0027s The Martian went on to receive seven nominations in 2017 – evidence, perhaps, of the Academy taking responsibility for its past errors.1023 Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee\u0027s Do the Right Thing failing to win Best Picture at the 1990 Oscars is one thing – losing out to Driving Miss Daisy is another thing altogether.   Having awarded both The Godfather Part I and The Godfather Part II Best Picture in 1972 and 1974 respectively, the Academy seemed destined to appreciate Martin Scorsese\u0027s Goodfellas. But no – Kevin Costner\u0027s directorial debut Dances with Wolves was the most appealing choice for voters.New talent on the block Quentin Tarantino\u0027s second feature Pulp Fiction won him the coveted Palme d\u0027Or at Cannes in 1994 – a success he failed to match back on home turf.

We don\u0027t see that film sitting atop the IMDb top 250 though, do we?If Heat was released today, there\u0027s no way it wouldn\u0027t be a Best Picture frontrunner. That it was completely ignored in favour of Braveheart is a huge travesty.You may think it was remiss of the Academy to shun Fargo, but it did come pretty close to winning, its chances bolstered somewhat by seven nominations and two wins (Actress for Frances McDormand and Original Screenplay for the Coen Brothers).

It\u0027s easy to see why Hollywood was temporarily more charmed by The Artist, but it\u0027s clear which film will stand the test of time.It\u0027s almost unthinkable to recall that the Coen brothers\u0027 Inside Llewyn Davis only scored two Oscar nominations in the cinematography and sound mixing categories, respectively. In the ensuing years, the film has been hailed as one of the greatest of the 2010s, meaning that its no-show at the Oscars will go down as one of the Academy\u0027s biggest omissions. Still, it would have had a hard time winning over 12 Years a Slave.For the 2015 Oscars race, you were either team Birdman or team Boyhood. Richard Linklater\u0027s labour of love, shot intermittently over 12 years, ultimately failed to win. If there\u0027s any justice, Andrea Arnold will one day become an Oscar winner, but in a perfect world, she would have already won for American Honey, a drama deserving of Best Picture if there ever was one.Horror rarely gets recognised at the Oscars, but Get Out is the closest the genre had come in years.

I don’t know anything else. I made one mistake in life, and it feels like I tried to kill the Queen’A man who has been in the UK since the age of 11 and has a British baby is set to be deported on a charter flight to Jamaica within days.Reshawn Davis, 30, was detained last Friday and told he would be removed to Jamaica on 11 February – on the second charter flight to travel to the country since the Windrush scandal two years ago.He is being removed from the country on the basis that he was convicted for robbery 10 years ago under the now-unlawful “joint enterprise” rule –\u0026nbspfor which he spent two months in prison.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Jamaican national, who lives with his British wife\u0026nbspand six-month-old daughter in northwest London and has not committed any crime since his conviction, said the thought of being ripped from his family and returning to a country he has not been to for 20 years terrified him.\u0026nbspUp to 50 other Jamaican nationals have been detained in recent weeks and are set to be deported on the same charter flight, which has been the subject of mounting controversy.A draft copy of the Windrush Lessons Learned report, leaked to the media on Thursday, said ministers should consider ending the practice of deporting people who arrived in the UK as children – prompting calls for ministers to halt the removal of iniduals like Mr Davis until it is published.Detainees are meanwhile struggling to access legal services to pursue challenges against their removal directions due to a mobile phone outage at Heathrow removal centres, which the Home Office has only just begun to resolve despite being aware of the issue since 13 January.Speaking from Colnbrook removal centre following the decision, Mr Davis, who has no family or friends in Jamaica, told The Independent: “I’m so stressed out. I can’t even explain how I feel. Yes I was born in Jamaica, but I was brought up here. I don’t know anything else. I made one mistake in life, and it feels like I tried to kill the Queen.\u0026nbsp“I look at my daughter’s pictures now every night before I go to bed. Since she was born I never had never spent a night without her until I was locked in here. I still reach for her when I wake up. I’m not one of those to leave my wife to do it by herself. I want to be there for them both.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Residents attempt to remove water from their property as the streets flood in Appleby-in-Westmorland, Cumbria, as Storm Ciara hits the UKEngland\u0027s Ellis Genge celebrates scoring the first try of their Six Nations match against Scotland with teammates.

I won’t be able to. That’s not something I wanted because I don’t want to sit down and rely on benefits. I’ve always worked. I’ve never been on benefits in my life.“I never imagined being a single mum. I don’t want to fall into the statistics of young single parents, especially for something that isn’t my fault and could have been prevented. It’s hard, emotionally and I would need help financially because it is hard having a young baby.“Reshawn is a great dad. He’s been here all the time with her. She loved him. He does a lot – feeds her, changes her, plays with her. A child needs their dad. I don’t know what’s going to happen now.”Mr Davis’s solicitor made representations for him to remain in the UK this week on the basis of family ties\u0026nbspbut it was ruled on Friday that he did not have a “genuine and subsisting” relationship with his wife or child and that it would “not be unduly harsh” for them to be without him.Rachel Meates, a solicitor from Irving Legal who is representing Mr Davis, said she was shocked that despite having provided a birth certificate, a marriage certificate and photographs, his relationship with his family\u0026nbspwas not being believed.“The Home Office has been quite manipulative in shutting down the arguments. There was enough evidence put in to suggest it was a genuine relationship – and I don’t know what more evidence we can submit from a five-month-old,” she said, adding:\u0026nbsp“It highlights the culture of disbelief that comes with the hostile environment.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “The planned charter flight to Jamaica is specifically for removing foreign criminals. Those detained for removal include people convicted of manslaughter, rape, violent crime and dealing class A drugs.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Responding in a way that in 2020 seems remarkably Trumpian –\u0026nbsp“I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect” – Biden put one of the last nails in the coffin for his campaign, and dropped out of the race shortly after.But, some 33 years later, Fahey says\u0026nbspthat he is ready to vote for Biden during his third race. If anything, the mere fact that Biden was on the campaign trail so long ago when someone like Pete Buttigieg was kindergarten-age underscores an experience Fahey values deeply: “I think he has had so much experience between his 36 years in the Senate and eight years as Obama’s vice president.Created with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds up a sign criticising billionaires in the presidential race in front of Michael Bloomberg in Compton, Califronia.

I think he knows the people to get a good team of advisers around him, so I think he could make an outstanding president.”With just two days until the New Hampshire primary, all signs point towards a disappointing third run for Biden, even as he has insisted that he could lose in both of the first two states in the primary season –\u0026nbsphe came in fourth place in the Iowa caucuses last week –\u0026nbspand still mount a comeback in Nevada and South Carolina.Biden escalates attack on Buttigieg before tepid performance in NHIn New Hampshire,\u0026nbspBiden has been campaigning around the state, but doing his best to manage expectations as enthusiasm has seemed to shift away from him and towards candidates like Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.On Friday night, early in the final debate in Manchester before voters head to the polls in the Granite State, Biden all but conceded defeat early. “I took a hit in Iowa”, he acknowledged, “and I’ll probably take it here”.It was a statement that was realistic, given the polls. According to Real Clear Politics, Biden has seen his polling tank, and currently sits in third place behind Sanders and Buttigieg. He’s just a tad ahead of Warren in aggregates of Granite State polls, though her numbers have shown much less volatility as the former vice president has cratered.Fahey didn’t seem to mind that Biden’s polls might not look so great. But\u0026nbsphe was offended by the concession, just days before the primary,\u0026nbspas volunteers across the state would have been gearing up to head out into 10F\u0026nbsp(-12C) weather to knock on doors for him, or spend their weekend making calls trying to boost his support.“I know for a fact having talked to some today that it’s discouraging to hear him say something like that with his supporters still out there working hard on the phone and knocking on doors as they are,” he says.On Saturday night, just a day after the debates, those volunteers and supporters didn’t seem to show up to support the vice president, either.

Instead, Biden gave what has become a somewhat regular campaign speech. He asked aloud how there could be the poverty he said he saw that morning at a food drive in Manchester. He promised to restore the US to its former dignity. The crowd largely sat silent.When pressed, Fahey acknowledges he is “not 100 per cent” sure that Biden can win the nomination, or the election. He says\u0026nbsphe has never harboured a grudge against Biden for the 1987 outburst, and was actually planning on voting for him if he had the chance all those years ago. But\u0026nbsphe is worried about Biden’s age, and how he might perform in a debate against Trump.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They successfully identied this inidual and ensured the appropriate support was provided.It is understood the fourth case was contracted from a Brit businessman who was confirmed with the bug in Brighton this week, having recently travelled to a ski chalet in France.The man, believed to be in his late s or early s, caught the virus in Singapore before flying to France before presenting at the Brighton AE days later.The man came into contact with  people in the Alpine ski resort of Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc, with the group now in hospital.Five Brits - including a nine-year-old boy - are now among those to have contracted the bug at the French resort.Bob Saynor, , and his nine-year-old son have been named locally as being at the centre of the outbreak in the village of Les Contamines-Montjoie near Megeve.Meanwhile, two Chinese nationals in York tested positive for the virus more than a week ago.Coronavirus has now claimed more lives than the  SARS outbreak as the global death toll climbed to more than  yesterday with more than , confirmed cases.So exactly how many Brits have been infected How many cases are there in Britain Four.The first two cases involved two Chinese nationals in York.A few days later, a British man in Brighton also tested positive.The fourth case was announced on February , with the unknown person treated in London.How many Brits are involved There are eight confirmed cases involving Brits.The man who tested positive in Brighton, as well as five cases in France.A father in Majorca has also contracted the virus, while one case is in Japan.A Brit dad was also quarantined in a Majorca hospital yesterday after testing positive.And Spanish authorities appeared to confirm the case was again linked to the French ski chalet.Fernando Simon, the director of the Spanish Ministry’s of Health’s Centre For Health Coordination and Emergencies said: He was in contact with a confirmed case in a French ski resort.Local authorities confirmed yesterday the British expat, who is  and lives in Marratxi near Palma, had sought help after coming into contact in France with someone later diagnosed with coronavirus.It comes after the second and final flight evacuating Brits from ground zero Wuhan arrived from China this morning.More than  evacuees landed at RAF Brize Norton - now expected to be quarantined for  days in Milton Keynes. And a leading expert today warned Britain could suffer a major outbreak of the killer bug, leading to a pandemic.Professor Peter Piot, of the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine, said he was becoming “increasingly alarmed” by the continued spread of the virus.He also told The Sunday Times he believes the deadly strain now poses even more danger than ebola.UK officials are now ratcheting up health advice to cover travellers from seven more countries outside China - Singapore, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Macau and Hong Kong.Englands top doctor saidanyone has been to those nations recently and falls ill should self-isolate and call NHS .Until now, this advice only related to people from Wuhan in China.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is often hope where we may first see ­dficulty. You just have to look a bit harder sometimes.In Portpatrick, at Scotland’s bottom left corner, the harbour had fallen into miserable disrepair. A plan was hatched to stop the rot.A local hero organised a share issue for locals to raise the money to buy the harbour and restore the buildings around it. The village now has its pecker up again and the future looks bright.It’s a similar story on Anglesey. At Halen Mon a thriving family business draws water out of the Menai Strait, harvests the salt and sells it all over the world.Near there I met a woman called Sian Sykes who cared about those waters so much she paddle-boarded  miles around Anglesey picking out the plastic.Asthat wasn’t enough, she then paddled the whole coast of Wales doing exactly the same.But my favourite character round there is no longer with us. On the very western tip of Holy Island off Anglesey’s west coast, there is the South Stack lighthouse. It’s been saving sailors from watery deaths since .A hundred years ago, John Jones was its keeper and it was his great granddaughter Denise Shaw who took me up to the top of it.Denise showed me a photograph of her great-grandad sporting a magnicent moustache the seagulls must have coveted for their nests.He was no loner, though. Denise remembers her mum saying old great-gramps was a bit of a ladies’ man.And what a chat-up line he had at his disposal: “Do you want to come back to my place to see how bright my light is ”All four of the areas we’ve looked at for this series of Our Coast are around the Irish Sea. I had a brilliant time at Belfast docks where I joined the harbour pilots, whose work astounded me.It’s their job to bring the giant ships safely into port.I sort of assumed they did this by chugging out to meet them, lighting up a sign saying, “follow me” and gently leading them to their berths.Far from it. Round the clock, all year round, whatever the weather, they race out several miles to pull up alongside these huge vessels.Incredibly, a rope ladder is dropped over the side for the pilots to clamber aboard, make their way to the bridge, take over the controls and steer these monsters into tight spaces on the docks.The ship I boarded with them, somewhat terried, was carrying grain from Romania.As my man took the helm I asked the Polish skipper which country had the best harbour pilots. “You do,” he said, with feeling.Back across the Irish Sea, in Formby, north of Liverpool, I met Mike McComb in the £million place he’s built himself a stone’s throw from the sea.He has more bedrooms, bathrooms and children than I could count .His fortune could have bought him a lavish home anywhere in the world. But it was up here, along the endless beach, that back in the day he and his mates would come on their bikes from their tiny homes in Bootle.So, he tells me as we stand on the beach, lashed by rain and wind, you can keep St Tropez or Malibu. This coast, his coast, is where he’ll stay.The sea seems to be a magnet for the most memorable people, from Grace the crane engineer in Belfast Docks who played rugby for Ireland in three rugby world cups, to Sandy the tattooed pagan near Stranraer who says the sea’s our mother, and the Bulgarian dissident I chanced upon sitting in a hot tub ­surveying Liverpool from the deck of the Queen Mary .My grandad used to tell me that when you put your toe in the sea you’re connected with the whole world.With that in mind, I’ve enjoyed many a paddle this summer reflecting on the power and history of what our island nation is all about.And I urge you to do it, too. After all, it’s pretty easy. Britain’s most landlocked place — Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire — is just  miles from the coast. So none of us is more than a couple of hours away from the sea.There’s never been a more relevant time to get out to the edges and see the soul of this country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it saddened us all because it felt like this incredible human being would go on for ever.He headed the Douglas dynasty with a zest for le that put the rest of us to shame and was one of our final links to Hollywood’s golden age.Long before actors ostentatiously wore their hearts on their sleeves and made self-aggrandising speeches about the latest trendy cause, Kirk determinedly set out to do the right thing, regardless of any impact on his career.In the Fties, at the height of the Cold War, he stood up to a paranoid US government that considered anyone to the left of Genghis Khan a Soviet sympathiser.The McCarthy witchhunts ruined careers and wrecked lives, but Kirk dug in his heels and hired blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo to work on Spartacus, which would become Kirk’s most famous movie.That took balls of steel.Kirk gave millions to charity and was a US Goodwill Ambassador, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Jimmy Carter in .He experienced heartache with the death of his son Eric from an overdose and the jailing of grandson Cameron for drug offences.But even a near-fatal helicopter crash and a stroke couldn’t defeat Kirk.His son Michael — a superstar in his own right, of course — told me last year his dad worked out almost every day with a personal trainer and remained as sharp as a tack, keeping the whole extended family on their toes.I was lucky enough to interview Kirk back in my days with TV-am.The Beeb would fly them over from LA and put them up in a posh hotel.All we could offer was a hearty breakfast, plus the chance to talk about themselves and their new project for as long as they liked.There were no pesky managers and PRs to go through.Bette Davis, Burt Lancaster, Lauren Bacall and Sammy Davis Jnr all popped into our studio at the crack of sparrows, staying for the duration of the show.Kirk was here in , promoting Dance With The Devil, a racy novel that bore a passing resemblance to his extraordinary le story.After his Jewish parents escaped persecution in Russia, Kirk was born and raised in a poor area of New York.It is a real rags-to-riches tale. His dad actually worked as a rag-and-bone man.Kirk never forgot where he came from, which is perhaps why he became a champion for justice and a fairer society.He was a delight that morning and even laughed when the crew declared, “I’m Spartacus”, one after another in his honour — though he must have seen it done hundreds of times before.He was a also a much-loved husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather.The Douglas clan will be in mourning but they can celebrate a le well lived.This weekend, I am on a Kirk Douglas marathon, starting with Paths Of Glory, before The Bad And The Beautul, Ace In The Hole, The Vikings, Lust For Le and, of course, Spartacus.Tomorrow’s Oscars will rightly honour him. We won’t see his like again.I WAS honoured to host The Millies this week.It is a wonderful event run by The Sun to salute our Armed Forces and give us all a chance to say a huge thank you.As always, there were astonishing stories of bravery, courage and self-sacrice.And as always, our lovely winners told me they were nothing special, just doing their job.I honestly don’t think they realise just how remarkable they are, or how much we owe them.One of my highlights was seeing -year-old Private Fin Doherty collect his award for inspiring others.Fin was just six when his paratrooper big brother JJ was killed in action in Afghanistan.Fin was determined to follow in JJ’s footsteps to honour his brother’s memory, and join the Parachute Regiment.He has been an outstanding addition and, in an emotional ceremony, was presented with JJ’s beret in December.Their mum Joyce admits she struggled with Fin’s decision to sign up, following the death of her eldest son.But she knew it was all Fin wanted – and she is so very proud of him.We honestly don’t deserve such an inspirational young man. But thank the Lord we have him on our side.NOTHING has changed. Phillip Schofield is exactly the same person he was before he felt the time was right to tell the world he’s gay.He’s still a loving father and husband and will still host his TV shows with consummate professionalism and skill.As Phillip said himself, you never know what people are struggling with every day and, for him, it was time to be honest with himself and everyone .I’m really glad that he has made the decision and very proud of him, although obviously it can’t have been easy.There’s been lots of tears, sleepless nights and a great deal of soul-searching. I hope he now finds peace of mind.He is a very lucky man to have a family and friends who love him very much and just want him to be happy.He also has a loyal fan base who love watching him on This Morning and that won’t change. Why would it Of course, he can expect a small number of bigots and homophobes to spew out hateful bile, but they are to be pitied and ignored.Those carping about why he took so long also need to shut up.People should be allowed to come out when it feels the right time for them.Phillip began his career at a time when being openly gay in a TV presenting role was just not an option.Thank goodness things have changed and he can be open now – and know that the overwhelmingly vast majority of us wish him and his family nothing but the very best.I was really touched by what he said about interviewing brave people on This Morning, and realising that he had to be just like them and tell his truth.Love comes in many dferent forms.Phillip and his we Stephanie adore each other and that won’t change. Again, why on earth would it At the end of his statement Phillip urged us all to be kind, especially to his family, and I hope we all take those words on board.Let’s wish them all the best and let them get on with their lives.WHAT a furore over a bare shoulder. Actress-turned-MP Tracy Brabin didn’t deserve the vitriol about her outfit but it WAS distracting.It’s unfortunate because Tracy was making important points about journalists being shut out of No  briefings – a move that makes my blood run cold and threatens Press freedom. Sadly, no one was really listening.Tracy told me she had been at a music event and didn’t expect to be back in the House. She is bemused by all the fuss.How those in public le dress should not detract from their message, be it a female MP in a low-cut top or mini-skirt, or a man wearing a gaudy tie or tight trousers.Our MPs are not known for their style and rarely make headlines for their fashion sense.I am very happy for them to keep it that way.WELL, that was a rather ill-advised memo to send, reminding local councils to fly the Union Flag on February  as a “celebration” of Prince Andrew’s birthday.I had no idea this was a “thing” and that Andrew was on a list of VIPs whose birthdays are marked with a flag waving on the roof of our town halls, instead of just cake and prosecco like the rest of us.Unsurprisingly, this ludicrous edict has caused much disgruntlement.As we know, Andrew has been booted out of The Firm by his own mum after that disastrous TV interview delving into his friendship with the American paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Then there is the ongoing scandal over whether or not Andrew will be interviewed by the FBI as part of its investigations into child trafficking allegations against Epstein.It is all very sordid and murky. Surely even his nearest and dearest would agree this is not the time for official celebrations.He is no longer a working royal and has no place on that list.Time to lower the flags for good. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody on that ship has tested positive.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisationhas shown that the reported number of new cases has fallen over the past two days, which experts welcomed with caution.There were roughly , new cases reported worldwide on February , , on February  and , on February  - the vast majority in China, WHO figures show.Patients in England with the virus will be transferred to one of four High Consequences Infectious Diseasesunits.These include two in London - the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, where the third victim is understood to have been taken.There are also two in the north of the country - Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust and Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.Two other patients who tested positive for the virus last week in York are still being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle.Access to these units is restricted to a team of trained medical staff who are made to wear protective gowns, face maks, visors and gloves before they can enter.In some cases, patients will have a specially-designed tent with a ventilator set up around their bed. But experts warned it is not yet clearthis represents an actual fall in cases or whether the fall will prove sustainable.The Department of Health and Social Care said that  people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus as of pm Friday, with three cases confirmed.It is understood that the third person in the UK to be diagnosed with coronavirus caught the illness in Singapore.He is reported to be a middle-aged British man and is understood to be the first UK national to contract the disease.The man is thought to have been diagnosed in Brighton and was transferred to St Thomas Hospital in London, where there is an infectious disease unit, on Thursday afternoon.Professor Keith Willett, NHS strategic incident director, said the patient had called the NHS  service after becoming concerned.After a telephone assessment, they were advised to make their way to Royal Sussex County Hospital Brighton for testing, he said.Following a pre-arranged plan with the NHS they drove themselves to the hospital, were tested in isolation and away from public areas of the hospital, and ed home in isolation in their own car.Two other patients, who had recently travelled from China, are still being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle.One is a student at the University of York, while the other is a family member. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I can’t be sure, as I have other things to think about like: I need some new trousers.Then out of the blue she announced on social media that she was going to speak out because “mine and my families le is no longer up for entertainment or gossip”.“Wow,” I thought. “That’s amazing. She doesn’t know how to use apostrophes.”It turns out, however, that while she can’t write properly, she can at least think straight because she never did speak out. Which means she stopped the story from rearing up again.If only Prince Andrew was as bright. We were all dimly aware that he knew a man in America who’d had lots of sex with young girls.And that one day, this man had been found dead in a police cell. Then we went back to wonderingwe needed more washing-up liquid.Prince Andrew, however, decided that instead of letting the story die down by not saying anything, he’d go on television to set the record straight.It was a disaster. He was suddenly front-page news all over the world and he looked guilty as hell.Of what, we weren’t sure. But whatever it was, we all worked out that as he has a Bentley, he could definitely have got from a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking to the centre of London in less than six hours.A few weeks later, as the story was withering once more, Hank J Dieselburger, an American prosecutor involved in the dead sex-man’s case, announced that the FBI had received “zero co-operation” from Prince Andrew.You’d think Andrew would have learned from his earlier mistake. You’d think he’d do a Flack and say nothing.But no. The very next day, “friends” of the Prince — which is another way of saying “the Prince” — went on the attack, telling reporters he was angry and bewildered. “They haven’t even approached me — I mean him.”The problem is that ego-fed celebrities read every single thing that is written about them. And they believe everyone  is reading everything, as well.We aren’t. We don’t really care. So when you attempt to clear your name, it’s like trying to put out a fire with petrol.It’s better for Andrew, and the whole Royal Family,he takes a leaf from singer Ronan Keating’s book — “You say it best, when you say nothing atThen, perhaps, he could take a leaf from his nephew’s book. And bugger off to Canada.I’M not defending drugs here, but when you see someone giggling their way through a packet of frozen peas and some leftover sherry trle at five in the morning, it’s easy to see why someone might think: “Yes, that cannabis malarkey looks like fun. I shall give it a go.”It’s the same story with cocaine.You see a dullard finding himself absolutely fascinating at a party and you think: “I’ll have a crack at that.”But this new drug, flakka, is dferent.One man who took it ate a homeless man’s face. Another gouged her own mother’s eyes out. And a third cut off his own penis.Which raises an interesting point. Why would anyone look at someone cutting off his old fella and think, “Ooh, I’ll have what he’s having ”A BUNCH of people who think the Lake District should only be used by ramblers decided to stage a protest over plans to put ten small tourist yachts on Grasmere lake.However, before the protest could take place, the idea was abandoned. And guess what  Yup. The protest went ahead anyway.They were actually protesting about something that wasn’t going to happen. Which proves what I’ve suspected for quite some time. Ramblers aren’t entirely right in the head.Next week, they will be protesting about the sonic booms made by Concorde and the burning of witches.LAST Sunday, driving was banned in the Italian city of Milan.Who thought that was a good idea  Getting an Italian to leave his car at home is impossible. It’s a part of his being, like his liver and his lungs.Needless to say, the scheme was not very successful.So not very successful in fact that, in the first three hours, the police had issued  fines. And the authorities now admit the ban was “largely ignored”.THERE’S much talk at the moment about how internet shopping is killing the High Street. But I’m not one of the murderers.When the time comes for my annual clothes shopping trip, I simply head to the Levi’s store on Regent Street in London, point at the label on the back of the jeans I’m wearing and ask for three more pairs just the same.I love Levi’s. I’ve worn nothing  since I was  and I’ve always loved their shop, the staff have always been brilliant. They always have what I need in stock and they never ask for my phone number or email address. I’m in and out in two minutes flat.This year, though, there was a disaster. There were two disinterested youths in there who looked at the label on the back of my jeans and said, “We don’t make those any more.”WHAT  ! !On the verge of fainting with shock, I dragged them back from their interesting conversation about Stormzy and was told in an exasperated fashion that I could still buy them online.This begs a question. What’s the point of having an expensive-to-run shopyou then fill it with people who tell you to go home and buy what you need on the net PETA, an organisation for animal enthusiasts who like to wear clothes made from crude oil, have announced that people often see their pet dog as nothing more than a cheap burglar alarm.Cheap You can buy a home alarm kit these days for less than £, whereas a proper dog is going to be way more than that.Plus, you only need feed an alarm with a tiny amount of electricity to keep it running, whereas a dog requires a bed, a blanket, food, water and, later on, vets bills that will make your eyes water.THIS week, a car crashed through my fence, turning it and an expensive new gate into matchsticks.By the time I got there, the car was gone. But there was still a lot of “police aware” tape fluttering about in the breeze.So I called the nearest station, which was approximately  miles away, as I needed to contact the driver to talk about insurance. Sadly, however, while the police are “aware” of the incident, they are not prepared to give me any details.Mustn’t grumble, though. While it will cost a few hundred quid to get everything mended, I must accept that the police have much more important things to do, such as investigating dead people who weren’t paedophiles.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The young folk born this century, like my -year-old daughter, do not watch it. The BBC means nothing to Generation YouTube.And the millions of us who grew up with the Beeb no longer recognise it as the benign Auntie that gave us Doctor Who, Top Of The Pops, Le On Earth, Fawlty Towers, The Likely Lads and David Dimbleby staying up all night at the General Election.That old beloved BBC — endlessly entertaining, scrupulously fair — is dead now. The BBC’s coverage of the night we left the European Union was nothing less than shameful.Here was a moment of truly historical signicance, the kind of national event that the BBC was born to cover. And it was dished up like a dull night at the Eurovision Song Contest.Down in Parliament Square, awash with Union Jacks and peaceful, happy patriots, BBC reporter Geeta Guru-Murthy blurted: “It’s a very white crowd mostly” — to the bewilderment of the many black and Asian people who were there to celebrate.But, of course, the BBC continues to peddle the filthy little lie that Brexit has its roots in the racism of the bigoted British people.Meanwhile, Sophie Raworth sat primly in a BBC studio made up to look like the EU flag. The studio never turned red, white and blue. There was no sense that the largest vote for anything in British history was being honoured. Why must we pay £billion a year for this one-sided garbage My colleague Ally Ross has pointed out that BBC “comedy” shows like Have I Got News For You, Frankie Boyle’s New World Order and The Mash Report have all been larded with anti-Brexit orthodoxy for years. Now the predictably loony Remainer-speak even seeps into the poison the BBC drips into our children.On the day we left the EU, the BBC released a CBBC Horrible Histories special mocking British stupidity.Queen Victoria was accused of callously sweetening her tea with sugar harvested by slaves — even though slavery was abolished four years before Victoria came to the throne.Historian Andrew Roberts described the mocking film as “a stream of bigoted hatred directed at this country”. They truly don’t get it in Broadcasting House. Millions of licence fee payers are deeply offended by the BBC’s relentlessly anti-British, anti-Brexit sentiment.It is why we fell out of love with the BBC. There is talk about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, or making payment optional. But the BBC no longer represents the entire nation. It peddles the prejudices of the disappointed elite who run it.The BBC does not speak for the British people. It doesn’t even seem to like us very much. So why should we pay anything at all for this crap AFTER being overlooked at the Oscars for her sensational performance in Hustlers, the half-time show at the Super Bowl felt like the revenge of Jenner Lopez.But Hustlers is my favourite film of the past  months. Lopez deserved an Oscar for her role.And whoever wins Best Actress at the Oscars tonight, I bet they can’t slide down a pole like her.MICHELLE OBAMA always said: “When they go low, we go high.”Meaning that when the Republican opponents of President Obama struck a low blow the Obamas had a strict policy of keeping their cool, their dignity and the moral high ground.The most senior Democratic politician in America just failed to take Michelle Obama’s advice. At his State of the Union address, President Trump petulantly refused to shake the hand of NancyPelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives. Pelosi should have shrugged off Trump’s rudeness and perhaps laughed in Donald’s orange face.Instead, clearly boiling with rage, Nancy ripped a copy of Trump’s speech to pieces. As the speech was full of optimistic stuff about making America a fairer, more prosperous place, the only person Pelosi humiliated was herself.The Democrats are starting to make Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party look like an effective opposition.THE classic James Bond films – Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger – were all less than two hours long.But in the modern fashion for over-long movies – The Irishman clocks in at three hours and  minutes – the next Bond film, No Time To Die, will be the longest ever at almost three hours.Let’s hope that means plenty of Ana de Armas, , as Bond girl Paloma. And not too much of Daniel Craig, , moaning about ’s dodgy knees.Teenage girls are messier than teenage boys. But teenage boys are, in my experience, more likely to leave takeaway pizza under the bed for six months for the mice to nibble.And when vermin move in, you really long for your little darling to move out.SUCKING up to the millionaire snowflakes in the audience, Prince William complained about the lack of ersity at the Baftas.I don’t believe it. This year a black actor, Micheal Ward, won the Rising Star Bafta for gang film Blue Story. Six years ago,  Years A Slave won Best Picture, competing with epic Hollywood fare like Gravity.If the film or performance is good enough, then the Baftas is colour blind.The real lack of ersity is among British actors.

The energy giant hiked its £ minimum top-up fee for a pay-as-you-go meter to £ on January , a change it blamed on rising admin costs.But the Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill warns the change has had a grim impact on some of the most precarious people in society - and accused the firm of the height of social irresponsibility. Now more than , people have signed Ms Gillaposs petition on the Degrees website calling for the change to be reversed.The petition quotes one customer, nicknamed Daniel, who says: I use a pre-pay meter because I can’t afford a direct debit. £ may not sound a lot, but when you’re scraping together coppers just to make up the money, it can be the dference between a hot meal and going hungry.  Another, Trevor from Stafford, said: Sometimes you just haven’t got that fiver to top up the meter - because you’re not getting paid until the end of the week - so you can’t. It means choosing between things like food, and heat - and in cold weather itaposs even worse.They obviously don’t understand that lots of people live hand to mouth. They think everyoneaposs rich - it’s not true. British Gas needs to change it back.” The petition page has also been inundated with comments, some of which are from people whoaposve seen the impact of the policy. One contributor, Marie E, wrote: I work in a post office topping up those cards and keys. I get a lot of customers putting just £ on as it’s their last £ until payday. We are not talking about people on benefits, but hard-working families trying to get by. It would mean these families not having gas on for a day or so in cold weather too.  Another, Sheryl G, wrote: Having recently lost my job and trying to find another one, I am well aware of how dficult it is to live on a very very low income. I often have to choose between being cold or eating. How can British Gas gas do this  Labour MP Ms Gill said: Pre-pay meter top-ups are a leline for many people at the precipice of poverty, often in debt and unable to predict their income from week to week. British Gas’s decision to raise the minimum top-up amount from £ to £, in the middle of winter and the most financially challenging time of year for many people, is the height of social irresponsibility.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email HS to Manchester and Leeds has been hurled into doubt amid claims Boris Johnson will put the huge leg of the rail line under review.The Prime Minister is tipped this week to finally approve Phase One of the high-speed link from London to Birmingham - despite opposition from scores of Tory MPs. But multiple reports say he will stop short of approving Phase Two to Manchester and Leeds - instead ordering extra analysis on the costs. And today he found an unlikely ally in the Mayor of Greater Manchester - who called for staff to be moved off HS Phase  and onto east-west rail links in northern England instead. Andy Burnham offered ministers a dramatic compromise to prioritise aposNorthern Powerhouse Railapos ahead of the second leg of HS.  It is understood Mr Burnham made the offer in a bid to get ahead of the formal announcement, expected on Tuesday, and ensure funds are still won for northern transport. Mr Burnham still slammed reports there could be a review of the HS section beyond Birmingham, telling Sky News: “That sounds like the same old story to me. London to Birmingham gets a gold plated railway and we get a second-class option or maybe nothing at all. “For a government that’s claiming to be standing for the north, I think this takes them into quite dangerous territory.” But crucially he said there could be an “opportunity” for “compromise” - to prioritise east-west Northern Powerhouse Rail connections instead. “We’ve never been convinced in Greater Manchester about the design of HS on our side of the country,” he said. “If you asked people in the north which one they would prioritise, most people would say get east-west right. “So in many ways,government ministers are listening this morning, I want to make an offer to them. “If we can all agree that we now prioritise east west on the western half of the country, get the design right at [Manchester] Piccadilly, get high speed rail to Liverpool more quickly - then I think that’s something we could get behind. “Because we could look at the prospect of an east-west railways across the north opening in the s, HS is only planned to come here in the s.  “So there is room for a compromise here. Maybe it’s about taking the team who are working on HS north of Birmingham off that project and putting them on Northern Powerhouse rail.” West Midlands mayor Andy Street said he still believed the whole line would get the go-ahead. He told the BBC: I personally think the line will be given the go ahead in principle for the whole line, even though they’ll only be giving the go ahead for the building of the London-Birmingham stage, because that’s the only stage with the tenders, and that includes the rebuilding of Euston.  Askedhe had “got one over” Dominic Cummings, the Boris Johnson aide who is against the project, he said: “Yes Dominic Cummings was against it, let the battle begin!” The from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester has prompted a Tory civil war amid warnings its cost could spiral from £bn to £bn.At least  Tory MPs have spoken out against the project but it has won the backing of key Cabinet ministers including the Chancellor Sajid Javid.Boris Johnson commissioned a review of the project last year by independent expert Doug Oakervee.

And it doesn’t adjust the figure for inflation.  The research behind SchoolCuts has been declared a fair representation of the state of education funding by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies. Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The School Cuts website run by the National Education Union gives parents the information they need to see what the real picture for funding is in their school. “The Government’s website doesn’t account for inflation and it only shows changes since  – ignoring all the cuts the Government has made since . “So this website really isn’t very useful to parents and therefore every penny spent on it is a penny wasted”.

Deit Deitreich-Briggs, , looks after his grandchildren five or six days a week from am to pm, plus a couple of nights, to enable his daughters to work. The Birmingham pensioner loves to cook for Lacey, eight, Indie, six, and Zayn, six, and also collects them from school, helps them with homework and supports them during their out of school activities. Running to a tight budget on his pension, Mr Deitreich-Briggs says he manages to feed the four of them for just £ a week.Among the dishes he prepares for the children, there are homemade fish and chips, pizza and mini toad in the holes, Birmingham Live reports.At the weekend, the kids often like to help their grandad bake chocolate and vanilla cakes for them to eat during the week. “I love having a close bond with my grandchildren and wouldn’t want it any other way,” the retired retail manager said. I’m proud of my daughters and their careers, and glad I can help them to have the lestyles they need to be able to work and have children. I enjoy making all our food from scratch, ensuring itaposs healthy and balanced, and teaching the children to cook too. Mr Deitreich-Briggs, from Erdington, Birmingham, is a widower so he cares for his grandchildren on his own.  We have an extremely good breakfast every day and then they go off to school laughing and happy, said Deit, they are doing well and are happy, they’ve got that stability. They also do their homework every morning before going to school. He gives them tea at pm then takes them to football, swimming and the gym before their parents come to collect them. The -year-old, who is a yoga teacher, then goes to work. Among his tips to cook healthy meals on a budget, Deit said it is important to plan and prepare ahead, make sure nothing is wasted. Other tips include storing leftovers, shopping at value supermarkets, using honey instead of sugar and getting the kids a meal chart.  His daughter Amii Deitreich-Worthington, , is a corporate travel consultant and lives just down the road in Erdington. She said: My and my husband wouldn’t be able to both work full time without dad, he takes the pressure off us. It’s nice that the children have that special time with their grandad. When I was younger, I used to spend a lot of time with my nan. It’s great to have a dferent role model in your le who brings dferent ideas on how to do things. Amii, whose husband Ross works as a sht manager, added: The children learn a lot from their grandad. He has more time than we do and helps them with their homework. It’s such a big pressure having to get homework done and trying to get to after school clubs when you’re working full time.  It’s great that he makes sure they eat healthily too. We totally trust him to make the right decisions. When the kids are in his care, it’s his rules and what he wants to teach them. His daughter Zita Deitreich-Irving, , works as a part time legal secretary so her son Indie goes to his grandadaposs three days a week.  On the days when she is not at work, Zita meets her dad, niece and nephew to do the school run together and she helps Deit take them swimming on a Monday too. Dad is a massive help, we wouldnapost be able to do it without him, said Zita, who lives in Erdington and is married to Neil, a plumbing and heating engineer. It means by the time me and my husband get back from work, Indie has had his dinner and so he doesnapost have to wait to eat at pm at night.

Peter Stanton, , was raised by mum Hilda after she got pregnant following an affair with a US sailor. He began searching for his father Roland aged  and had almost given up hope. But he uploaded his DNA online and was put in touch with half-brother Larry Arnold, , who lives in Florida. Dad-of-four Peter said: “We actually look alike, it is absolutely amazing. I was over the moon. “He used to play golf and I used to play as well and there are loads of silly similar things like that. “I was really disappointed that I missed my father. He passed away in  aged  but to know I have a brother feels out of this world. “I just want to give him a hug.” The pair are now making up for lost time by chatting on Skype weekly and plan to meet in person. Larry added: “I am completely in awe of this whole thing and I am looking forward to the day we meet. “I have so many things I want to tell him about our father. “I would have loved for dad to have known Peter. He would have been so proud.” Roland joined the US Navy aged  and served as a minesweeper. He was stationed in Plymouth, Devon, when he met Hilda during preparations for the Normandy invasion.  But following the Second World War he ed to the US, leaving her pregnant and heartbroken. Peter joined the Royal Navy Gunnery Division aged  to follow in his mother’s footsteps, and served for  years. He sent DNA to ancestry five years ago but there was no match until Larry, who was in the US Army National Guard, registered himself. Larry told him Roland believed Hilda had given birth to a daughter. Peter, of Walthamstow, East London, explained: “He had a wire signal back when he ed to the States and he tried looking for the girl and could never find her and he couldn’t locate my mother either. “Obviously the signal was wrong.  “He also seems to think my mother looked pretty much like his mother, which could be the reason they got together.” Sadly the half-brothers discovered they have both suffered from types of cancer.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe best pal who once defended mass murderer Jeremy Bamber to the hilt has turned his back on him – and rubbished his new alibi. Brett Collins broke his silence for the first time in over three decades to tell why he thinks Bamber, who slaughtered his family at their sprawling Essex farmhouse in , should never be released from jail. In the years since, Brett has gone from believing in Bamber’s innocence – even getting a lawyer to defend him – to being convinced of his guilt. And describing his one-time closest friend as “a Jekyll and Hyde personality”, he said: “He should never be released from jail. He has a dark side and a nasty streak.” Brett, now  and back living in his native New Zealand where the Sunday People tracked him down on an island, spoke out on the case after hearing that Bamber was planning a new appeal against his conviction. Bamber, now , is serving le for shooting five members of his family, a crime which forms the basis of current ITV drama White House Farm. His legal team are mounting an appeal based in part on claims the real killer was inside the house and a rle was seen at a window while he was outside talking to police. But Brett today demolishes the idea that Bamber can prove he has an alibi which means he could not have been responsible for the massacre. He insisted: “He didn’t ever bring up someone being inside or being seen at the window when the police were there with him to me. It’s just bulls**t.” Describing the events of the time, he recalled: “I got a lawyer to represent Jeremy at his court case and at that stage I believed in him.  But as time has gone by, and I’ve had a lot of time to think about things, I’ve totally changed my mind. “I remember saying to him at the time, ‘You’re going to need an alibi – they might put this thing on you’. He said to me, ‘Oh, I have it. I was at home’. I said to him, ‘That doesn’t sound like much of an alibi’. “Jeremy should stop this appeal, stop stirring things up and leave people alone. He should never be released from jail.” Speaking from his cell in Wakefield jail last month Bamber said: “It is the ultimate alibi that I was in the company of dozens of police officers when it was clear that a person or persons were alive in the house who I am convicted of murdering.”  He claims his schizophrenic sister Sheila, a model known as Bambi, murdered their -year-old parents Nevill and June and her twin sons Nicholas and Daniel, six, at the house in rural Tolleshunt D’Arcy. Brett said he remembered asking Bamber immediately after the mass slaying what had been “going on” within the family. He said,‘You wouldn’t believe what went on’, but he would go no further. That was the same answer he gave me every time I asked him. “The idea that his sister would shoot the family, put the silencer away in the cupboard, and then shoot herself is just crazy.” Brett’s new testimony comes as the murders are being portrayed in the six-part TV drama White House Farm, which finishes this Wednesday. It stars Freddie Fox as Bamber and Alfie Allen from Game of Thrones as Brett.  Brett recalled how Bamber displayed no real grief over the deaths of his family, laughed at their funeral, and could not wait to blow his inheritance on women, cars and parties. He said: “At the funeral Jeremy wasn’t depressed or really down. He was making jokes and was almost theatrical. “After the murders he asked me to go to the farm with him and help him take all the valuable stuff he had picked out to go to the auctions in London. “He literally rled through the house in every hidden spot grabbing handfuls of cash. “I said, ‘Oh my God, they’re barely dead’ and he said, ‘It’s mine, I’ve got to do it sometime’. “After the funeral we were staying at what used to be his sister’s apartment in Hampstead. “There were loads of photographers and journalists outside the front door waiting for him.  He said to me, ‘Because you’ve stood by me and helped me, I’ll shout us a trip to the south of France’. “We had a wonderful two weeks and he was in the highest of humour. “You’d never think he’d been through a funeral at all. He was just full of le and looking forward to his new le with money. “That was when I first began to wonderhe’d done it, but I put it to the back of my mind. “He was constantly speaking about the inheritance he was going to get and how he’d be able to buy whatever he wanted. “He said he wanted to buy a Ferrari or Porsche and put the farm on the market as soon as possible and live as a playboy in London.” Brett added that Bamber repeatedly had wild sex with a married woman from Switzerland they had met in the expensive ski resort of St Tropez.  He said: “We went to a private beach you had to pay to get into. There was music and champagne. “An older lady sent two bottles over to us and when Jeremy went to the toilet she came over to me and saidI could get him to sleep with her she would buy us both a beautul dinner. “This went on for a week with Jeremy sleeping with this woman. She took us to the most expensive restaurants in St Tropez and some amazing nightclubs. “It made my holiday but apparently she was like a mountain lion in bed as she kept scratching all his back like you wouldn’t believe. She was married and about ten years older, but had the body of an -year-old.”  The pair were arrested at Dover when they ed from the south of France and Brett had to prove by his passport stamps he had been on holiday in Greece at the time of the murders, so could not be involved. He stood by his friend and was photographed around that time with Angela Greaves, who was reported to be Bamber’s girlfriend. He remembered: “Jeremy spoke amazingly and had a presence but he’s a Jekyll and Hyde personality. “It was like he could turn tears and sadness on when other people like the police were around, but when he was with me he was completely normal. Andhe’s in a corner he becomes lethal.”  Brett, who lives on the island of Waiheke near Auckland, first met Bamber when he went out to New Zealand to do a ing course. The pair kept in touch and resumed their friendship when Brett visited England. He recalled his surprise at finding out that Bamber, who was adopted after being born into a family of Buckingham Palace servants, hated his loving family. He said: “He told me that in his early teens he had been raped by an older man and I think that screwed him up a bit. “When I first came to England I met his father and he took us fishing. “We spent the day together but Jeremy told me he’d never really liked his father that much and he didn’t like his mother at all.  I’ve still got a very clear memory of everything that happened and I’m now sure he staged it all on the day of the murders. “He had quite a devious mind and used to love the cut and thrust of making up stuff. He had a love and greed for money. Anyone who knew him close like I did knew that money was the number one thing in his le. It wasn’t normal.

Despite weeks of turmoil following Harry and Meghan’s shock decision to swap the UK for Canada, Kate, , looked happier and more relaxed in her regal duties than ever. Wearing a recycled white and gold gown by Alexander McQueen, the mum-of-three gossiped and giggled with Judy actress Renée Zellweger – even patting the star’s arm affectionately. Kate also met  director Sam Mendes, while husband Prince William, , mingled with Hollywood heavyweights including Joker star Joaquin Phoenix. According to body language expert Judi James, Kate’s appearance at the glitzy event marks a dramatic new direction for the Duchess. Judi says: “It has been a perfect storm for the Royal Family lately but Kate has now taken on the biggest power position in the entire Firm. “She’s the new matriarch because while the Queen is strong, she’s getting older and needs that kind of support from someone she can trust.” Kate has come a long way from the shy, -year-old student who first caught William’s eye during a university fashion show in . Since marrying in to the Royal Family in April , Kate has often seemed uncomfortable in the glare of the public eye.  “In the early days, she would hide herself in William’s shadow, but it was clear from her appearance at the Baftas that all of that has totally changed,” says Judi. “She’s not remotely dependent on him any more.” However, Judi thinks that Kate’s newfound confidence has had a positive impact on Wills, too. “Seeing them hold court with superstars, it was obvious they have shted into real power couple mode. “It’s ironic, as that’s the path Harry and Meghan were meant to take, but Kate looks incredibly at ease in this new role.  The drama surrounding ‘Megxit’ – which saw Harry, , and Meghan, , controversially renounce their official duties – appears to have been the defining moment in Kate’s rise to the top of the Windsor tree.Judi says: “She’s been supporting William and acting as a mediatorduring all the recent arguments. “By playing out these complicated roles so perfectly, she has provedherself to be the royals’ big saviour.”Royal expert and author Ingrid Seward believes that the Queen, , is hugely grateful to Kate for stepping up. “She’s delighted with her,” she says.  “The Queen is very reliant on Kate because she’s so stable – and she’s simply untouchable in everything she does at the moment.” Although Ingrid does not believe Kate ever felt threatened by Meghan joining the family, she adds: “The recent fall-out between Harry and William would have been draining for her, so she’s probably feeling a huge weight off her shoulders that she doesn’t have to worry about Meghan’s influence any more.” Kate’s priorities may also be changing now that her and William’s children – George, six, Charlotte, four, and Louis, two in April – are becoming slightly more independent. “Charlotte and George are at school now, so she has more time on her hands,” Ingrid says.  “That means she can do more of what she really enjoys – and we saw that with the garden she designed at last year’s Cha Flower Show. “In earlier years, she always had to toe the line. Now she can pursue her own interests more freely.”  Kate’s popularity with the British public seems to have rebooted her sense of style, too. Ingrid says: “She used to be so careful, wearing little dresses and nude heels with everything, but she’s much less mumsy these days.

Dean Chapman, , snubbed university to serve burgers at McDonaldaposs and now runs a business boasting four branches with a turnover of more than £ million. The dad-of-three, from Leicester, took his first McDonaldaposs job aged  job to generate cash for a college canoeing holiday. But now, Dean and his team run restaurants at Cherry Street near Temple Row, Bristol Road, near Belgrave Middleway Stephenson Place, on the New Street ramp, and Kings Parade in Dale End, Birmingham Live reports. Deanaposs blue collar parents -  dad was painter and decorator and mum a machinist - were less than thrilled when he decided to ditch his A Levels to work full-time at the Golden Arches.  But he worked his way up from McDonaldaposs crew member to director level. In  he was appointed Head of Franchising UK, helping franchise owners run and manage their restaurant more effectively. In , he resigned as a McDonaldaposs employee to buy his own restaurants as a franchisee. Dean said: I first bought two - Stephenson Place and Dale End. A year later I took on Cherry Street, followed by Bristol Road. All the McDonaldaposs in Birmingham are franchisee owned. Dean said: When I started only around  to  per cent of UK McDonaldaposs restaurants were franchises - that is owned by independent business owners like me. It was not the UK model then. Now around  per cent of McDonalds restaurants in the UK are franchises. It has grown hugely. With a turnover of more than £.million, according to public accounts published for the year ending December , , he is certainly doing something right. Dean put his success down to hard work, graft and a bit of luck along the way. He said: If you put your heart and soul into the work, the opportunities are there. So what are his multi-million pound secrets   What were you doing before you started at McDonaldaposs  I was studying Physics,  Maths and Electronics at Leicester College. I wanted to be an electrical engineer and planned to go to university - I would have been the first in my family to go. I got a part-time job at my local McDonaldaposs in Leicester to help pay for a canoeing holiday.  When I came back from the holiday, I continued to work at McDonaldaposs and I ended up working more and more hours. I was practically a full-time employee before I knew it. I guess my lightbulb moment came after I ed from my holiday. I remember sitting in class at college, putting my hand up to ask to be excused to go to the toilet and being told I couldnapost and that I should have gone on a break. I threw my toys out of the pram, walked out and never went back. My parents were very disappointed,  I wasnapost going to university. Obviously they donapost feel that way now.  What I loved about the job - which is still true today - was it was all about teamwork and camaraderie. I’m a very shy person in general but after a few weeks I found my feet and within a few months,  I was running the kitchen with  staff. How do you progress from crew member   The management set-up back then was quite dferent. By the age of ,  I was running my own restaurant. I became Leicester area manager at . While going through the ranks I got a lot of training and business qualications at what we call hamburger university - an office in Sutton Coldfield. These are courses not externally recognised but when I go into organisations to talk about the franchisees, the stuff I’ve been taught are well-known business models.  My last few jobs as a McDonaldaposs employee were as director of operations and head of franchising in the UK. Why did you decide you wanted to be a franchisee  The higher up I got in the company, the further away I got from what I loved - interacting with staff. When I was training franchisees for the company, Iaposd give advice about what they could do to run a better McDonaldaposs and move the business forward. I wanted to implement these things myself. Now I have my own franchise business consultant  - the job I used to do -  who gives me a fresh pair of eyes and a good overview. Have your children any plans to follow your career path  They are very proud and it is a family business - my we is the bookkeeper. I have three children, Heidi, Finlay and Luke. Finlay has a natural affinity with business and wants to study that at university.  Luke and Heidi love maths. She is studying maths at St Andrews, where Kate Middleton and Prince William met. Apparently an Indian princess is studying there now! How do you become a franchisee and how much money do you need  You need an initial outlay of unencumbered cash of £,. And be accepted for an application programme. The selection process is quite intense. There is an extensive application process. Then there is a nine-month training period after that. Whataposs the best thing about being a franchisee  Seeing people progress. All my managers worked from crew up. I think it would be frustrating to work somewhere where there were no ways to progress - absolutely the opportunities are there in McDonaldapossyou want them.  For example one employee Cha who was on our apprenticeship programme started as crew in October  and was promoted to sht manager within four years. aposYou need an initial outlay of unencumbered cash of £, to own a franchiseapos You have to work very hard and put your heart and soul into it. There are other employees who donapost want to go up the ranks - which is fine. They just want a flexible job - and some cash to let them focus on other interests, whether that be sport or the arts. What changes have you seen since you started  When I started we didn’t sell breakfast - shocking when you consider how popular it is.   On the back of customer demand we have increased the breakfast time from .am to am so people can have a lie-in.  I remember the film Falling Down, when Michael Douglas is told he is a few minutes too late for the breakfast menu at a fast food restaurant and explodes. We donapost want people to feel like that! Also back when we started, it was just filter coffee. The only chicken we sold was nuggets. Now  per cent of our products are chicken.We sell as much chicken as beef. As the years have progressed,  peopleaposs tastes have evolved. More recently we have offered salads, veggie wraps and vegan dippers. Who knows what it will look like in  years  The restaurants themselves have transformed massively over the last five years, we have table service, the My McDonald’s app and McDelivery. Describe your average day Every morning I get up at  and drive to Birmingham. Iaposm usually at the Dale End branch by .am. Iaposll get the business managers for the four stores together for a couple of hours.  Then they go back to their teams and have similar meetings with their teams. The rest of the day is spent catching up on emails. Every day starts with a meeting of some description - so it could be a team meeting. It could be a franchisee meeting, so we get together as franchisees and the community as well I currently have seven business managers working for me. I give them targets - feedback on how they are performing.

From the outside, the home looks like a standard terrace house - although it certainly stands out with its bright orange finish and baby blue doors and windows. But hiding behind its tiny facade is a six-bedroom family home and a rear that leads to a pebbled beach. The house, called Glenrosa, is situated on the Ceredigion coastline in the village of Borth, Wales - a short walk to the shops, pubs and restaurants. The view of Borth Beach and the Cardigan Bay coastline beyond makes the patio a great place for summer al fresco dining. Inside the home are three floors, with the extra floor created by utilising the loft space. Much of the interior of this home is designed with the seaside in mind. There are the whitewashed boardwalk style tiles in the shower room, the mini surfboards and le buoys on the bedrooms walls and sea landscape artwork. The ground floor offers a cosy living room that looks out to the street. There is an exposed brick fireplace with a log burner and stripped wood flooring. The room next to this is the dining room that can sit eight people in front of the exposed stone chimney fireplace. Also on the ground floor is the kitchen which leads to the back garden and offers sweeping views of the beach and sea. Imagine cooking Sunday lunch with the sound of the waves wafting in. The first floor room at the back of the house is the room with the best sea view. Originally built as a bedroom, the current owners have turned this into a lounge. They have added a large picture window that juts out so people can sit right by the window and watch the sea for hours. The master suite is on the same floor. It is not the largest room in the house, but it has a sublime view of the beach. There could be potential for a new owner to maximise the sea views from the pillow by adding in a Juliet balcony.

British citizens could see changes to healthcare, driving permits and border control being made as a result - as well as ato the blue British passport, Gloucestershire Live reports. Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis has confirmed the current maroon covers are due to turn blue now that the UK is no longer a part of the European Union. The design is in fact ato the original passport colour first used back in  - and itshas been delayed while stocks of the EU-style burgundy one are used up. For a standard ten-year passport, it means they will be stuck with red until . The first wave of blue passports will start being sent out by the end of March, but there is no guarantee which colour will be issued. A Home Office spokesman said: “There will be a mixture of blue and burgundy passports issued over a period of months, and we expect all new passports to be blue by the middle of the year. “As well as using up the existing stock of burgundy passports, the printing presses all need to be tweaked to make blue covers, which needs to be done in stages, otherwise the printing process would grind to a halt.”  The blue passports changed colour once the UK joined the EU and the burgundy shade was agreed upon and adopted soon after. The new passport is due to have up-to-date security features and technologies to protect against fraud and forgery - but the pages will be plastic instead of paper, making it more dficult to alter. Those who prefer the burgundy shade will not lose out - these passports will continue to be issued but without reference to the EU. They are due to be phased in over  andyou renew your passport in the next few months you could receive it in either colour.

More than  flood warnings and alerts had been issued across the UK as of Sunday afternoon as homes and businesses were in danger of being inundated by swollen streams. Firefighters rescued a person who was trapped inside a car in a flooded street in Blackpool. The weather was so bad that the Queen did not attend church in Sandringham as a precaution due to high winds in the area. The haunting sounds of flood sirens redolent of air raids filled the streets this morning. Eerie footage posted to social media shows the market town of Hebden Bridge, in West Yorkshire, at dawn with sirens wailing as the entire country was covered by amber or yellow severe weather warnings. John McMahon, who captured video as the sirens went off in Hebden Bridge, told : This is only the second time in . years Iaposve lived here [that Iaposve heard the sirens]. Itaposs obviously an eerie sound to wake to. For a horrid moment you get a glimpse of the fear felt by people facing genuine catastrophesworldwide. Hopefully we wonapost be in that bracket here.

Hundreds of homes have been hit by a power cut with more than  homes across Devon and Cornwall experiencing a blackout. People travelling by train face nightmare journeys. London Euston rail station is evacuating its premises due to overcrowding, as journeys are cancelled, delayed or erted. Residents in Blackpool are being evacuated today after their homes were flooded. An emergency centre has been set up for those affected and is being run by volunteers. Incredibly, the force of the gusts of wind is causing the Big Wheel on Blackpoolaposs Central Peer to rotate on its own. PO Ferries has suspended its service from Dover to Calais due to strong winds. The company wrote on its Twitter: Due to strong winds, all the services of the port of Dover are currently suspended. We are sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your understanding.The Dartford Crossing between Kent and Essex was closed. In some parts of the country a aposmajor incidentapos has been declared by fire and rescue services such as in Lancashire due to the high number of accident reports sparked by the storm. The Lancashire Fire and Rescue service has warned people not to travel unless absolutely necessary. With the force of the winds dislodging parts of building and sending debris flying, there are reports of people being injured.  Three people were hurt after the storm caused part of a pub roof to collapse in St John, Perth, on Saturday night. The chimney breast of a neighbouring building fell through the pubaposs roof causing it to cave in and dislodge the top of the pub building.

Strong winds have the potential to damage overhead electrical wires and tracks due to debris or falling trees. Disruption could continue into Monday morning as repair work may be hampered by the conditions.  Heathrow Airport said it had agreed with its airline partners to consolidate Sundayaposs flight schedule in a bid to minimise the number of cancelled flights. British Airways said it was offering re-booking options for customers on domestic and European flights flying to and from Heathrow, Gatwick and London City on Sunday.

Worried families, wearing facemasks, gathered at a medical centre adjoining the childaposs school in Les Contamines awaiting the results, which are due this evening. Officials have closed the -pupil primary school for lessons this week in the small ski resort, an hour from Geneva. The nine-year-old son of British couple Bob and Catriona Saynor, who moved to the Alps three years ago, is in hospital in France after being airlted from the resort on Friday afternoon. The local ambulance service estimated  people had been tested by Sunday afternoon. Health Minister Agnès Buzyn, speaking at a hastily arranged press conference in Les Contamines, said: “We have prioritised the children who have been in the most contact with the affected child, then the children who have symptoms and finally those who are less at risk because their contact has been reduced. “The situation is changing, our decision will depend on whether we have positive results in the evening.” Environmental consultant Mr Saynor, , has also been diagnosed with the deadly virus along with three other Britons from another family who were staying in the Saynor’s six-bedroom ski chalet. Mr Saynor’s two other children and four other Britons from the other family are in isolation in French hospitals as a precaution. A second school in nearby Saint-Gervais, which has  pupils and was attended by the Saynor’s son for one day last week, will also be shut this week. The mayor, Jean-Marc Peillex, advised against panic. He said: “We must not panic an entire population. We want to put into perspective the risk of contamination - the young Briton did not rub shoulders with a whole school but he rubbed shoulders with five students for half a day.” The Les Contamines Ski Club, where the child is a member, cancelled training on Sunday. One mother, whose child is friends with the British boy, was taking him to be tested. She said: “It’s scary. My son has had five days of high fever. Is it ‘flu  Is it something   We don’t know. I think it’s more contagious than they want to say.” Didier Mollard, a father of a child at the Les Contamines school, said: “We are taking their temperature twice a day and are watching them closely. We are worried  per cent for sure. “ Émilie Bétourné, a mother whose son attends the school, said: “My son is in the class of the brother of the child who is infected. “I am not panicking for the moment. I am waiting instruction from the doctors. We’ll listen to what they say and observe the health of our children. School is closed for the week.” Les Contamines village was eerily quiet on Sunday. The resort should usually be bustling with the start of the Paris half-term.  Local Sophie Lanier said: “It shouldn’t be this quiet in the resort. I think a lot of businesses are going to be worried that people won’t risk coming. It’s sad.” Skiers buying lt passes early Sunday morning also expressed their concerns. Joseph Dubois, , who was skiing with his we, said: “It’s a small ski station and we are a bit worried. We don’t know where the family went and who is now infected. It is a concern for certain.” Another skier, Laurent Guy, from Paris, said: “I have been coming here for a long time to this resort and I feel sorryit is going to be hit hard financially. It is a worry, of course, but we’re staying.” Annick Roger, director of the tourist board, said: Weaposve had a lot of calls.

His replacement Osman Sow was stretchered off on Saturday. Unfortunately, it sounds like he’ll sit out the rest of the campaign as well.But it’s a sign of the quality they have in their squad that Clark and Sow can be missing and you still have a striker of the calibre of Lawrence Shankland to lead the line. vw, px\"  Sow being out leaves a great chance for youngsters like Declan Glass and Chris Mochrie to show what they can do in the No  position.It’s unfortanute for people to get injured but also a great chance for some of United’s youngsters to impress.On top of Sow’s injury, Paul McMullan, Louis Appere and Calum Butcher have been carrying injuries recently, too.This week is an ideal time to give the players a bit of a break and recharge the batteries for the run-in.The Tangerines want to get that title wrapped up as soon as possible but this breather couldn’t have been better timed.Once again, other teams weren’t really able to make up any ground on the runaway leaders – Inverness clawed one point back at home to Alloa.United are the only team that have managed any sort of consistency this season – a wee break is just what they need to get going again."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Gary-and-Piacquiao-940x531.jpg ","title":"boxing fanatic gary todd describes brushes with the biggest stars in the sport since move from st marys to sydney","story":"Interviewing Muhammad Ali, having lunch with Manny Pacquiao and tracking down Deontay Wilder # it#s all in a day#s work for Dundee-born Gary Todd.Growing up in St Mary#s, Gary never would have imagined that one day he#d get the chance to meet boxing legends such as Mike Tyson and Julio César Chávez, however after moving to Sydney in  his le changed completely.The former Rockwell High School pupil now has two international bestselling books on the sport of boxing, and has had the chance to travel to countries such as Japan, Canada, the Bahamas, Hong Kong and the USA.He said: #I grew up in St Mary#s andI#m honest I didn#t go to school a lot.#I went to MacAlpine Primary School and I was at Rockwell for a year, but I dropped out to start working and earning some money.#I got a job at the slaughterhouse, but after a while I felt like I couldn#t see a future for myself in Dundee, so I decided to do a bit of travelling.#I went to Australia on a visa and loved it so much I decided to stay.#My we Jenny came with me and we got married and started a family here.#The boxing fanatic decided to join a local gym near his new home in Sydney, and soon found himself interviewing some of boxing#s greatest legends for a book on all the dferent workouts used in the sport.He said: #I#ve always been passionate about the sport, so I joined the gym.#I started training there and I made some connections and pals, then I kind of slipped into writing my book.#Throughout the course of writing his workout book, Gary has travelled across the globe, getting interviews and pictures with over  boxing champions.However, it hasn#t all been a walk in the park for the father of three.He said: #One time, a bodyguard threatened to shoot me.#I was talking to Marvin Hagler, who#s actually my favourite boxer of all time.#His bodyguard was annoying me and getting in the way and we started arguing.#He threatened to take me outside and shoot me, and Marvin Hagler just had to stand between us.#Gary, whose day job is as a director at a construction company in Australia, has gained a large amount of fame and respect in the boxing community for his work.He has produced two books, Workouts from Boxing#s Greatest Champs Volume  and , which have been popular among fans of the sport.The -year-old has been invited to watch Deontay Wilder#s fight against Tyson Fury later this month in Nevada, and plans to continue his work interviewing the biggest names in the sport.He said: #I#m a family man, I#m a construction worker, and I#ve got a passion in le which is boxing.#I#ve been into it since I was  years old, when the first Rocky film came out in cinemas.#It took me around  years to finish my first book, and I went all over the world.#I saved up my money and frequent flyer miles, flying all over the world economy class.#In two weeks, I#m planning to fly to Las Vegas to watch the Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder fight as part a member on a press accreditation.#He also confessed that his thick Dundonian accent does present a bit of a challenge at times, saying: #I do get some comments on it.

At the end, he admitted he was tired, it was his first  minutes in six weeks so, for that, he was really good.“Jordon Forster was really good beside him and the full-backs did well.“It’s not easy when balls come into your box constantly but I thought they held their own.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street united need a breather and dundees new no 7 impresses","story":"This week Tele sports writers George Cran, Calum Woodger and Graeme Finnan discuss Dundee United’s mini-blip, Christophe Berra’s Dundee debut and ask, Leigh Grfiths – innocent or guilty Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e3a893bc275e0.28246106-430x564.jpg ","title":"uniteds focus is the same insists key man butcher","story":"Dundee United midfielder Calum Butcher has moved to reassure supporters they remain focused on the task at hand – winning the title.They have experienced somewhat of a dip in form, falling to a - defeat against Arbroath on Saturday on the back of a Scottish Cup exit at the hands of Hibs and a - home draw against league foe Morton.However, Butcher is convinced United have enough about them to get back on track despite their slight slump.Historic league loss to Arbroath can spur Dundee United on to title, says defender Connolly\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp hurting-united-can-get-back-to-winning-ways embed # secretsltIJICf\" data-secret\"sltIJICf\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"The -year-old enforcer is not concerned about complacency and poor performances creeping into their game after their -match unbeaten league run came to an abrupt end against the Red Lichties.Instead, Butcher prefers to look at the positives, with their sights now fully fixed on maintaining their -point lead at the top of the Championship as they bid to secure ato the top flight after a four-year absence.“We were on a great run so all the positivity around the club remains,” he said.“We now know we’re out of the cup and there’s one main focus, which it was at the start of the season, and that’s promotion.“That stays with us now.”The Terrors grew increasingly frustrated at Tannadice last weekend as they struggled to break down an opponent defending stoutly after taking the lead.Butcher accepts that is to be expected when their Championship rivals come to town and is urging his team-mates to find a way to deal with it moving forward as their domestic campaign prepares to enter its final stretch.“It’s part and parcel, especially at home,” he added.“Teams have done it all season, sat in and made le dficult for us.“We’ve got to try not to give them a snf and make sure, when we get our chances, we take them.”The Tangerines are in the midst of a free week as Scottish Cup fth-round ties take place across the country.After bowing out following a replay against the Hibees at Easter Road last Tuesday, Butcher is happy to have full focus on the league for the run-in.The Englishman, who has enjoyed two spells on Tayside, also spoke of his appreciation for the club’s supporters. vw, px\"  He has been encouraged by their backing this season as they’ve romped to the top of the second tier and has called on them to keep that up.Butcher believes they’ll need their help until the end of the season and beyond, hopefully, in the top flight.And, with the investment in the club being made by owner Mark Ogren, Butch believes the future is bright for the Tangerines.“Even after going out of the cup last week, the fans stayed behind and clapped us off, which was great to see.“The fans have really bought into what the club want to do now.

Our efforts to continue revitalising Union Street are ongoing and enhancing the experience for those living and working in the city is an integral part of what we do as an organisation as we aim to drive footfall in the city centre.”Aberdeen City Council is taking an active approach to improve the city centre and has served notices on businesses deemed to “negatively impact the amenity of the area.”The owner of one business, Inspirations on Union Street which is vacant, was asked to make a string of repairs due to its condition bringing “signicant disamenity” to the area.An appeal was lodged with the Scottish Government last year which was rejected this month.Councillor Marie Boulton, the council’s lead on the city centre masterplan, said: “Union Street remains very much the heart of Aberdeen. The council is working with Historic Environment Scotland to conserve the fabric of its most important buildings by offering grants to owners.“CARS also aims to stimulate the economy by encouraging occupancy of vacant commercial units and upper floors for residential use.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby players pictured in their prime","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA black and white photograph featuring a Mid Argyll Rugby team, handed to the Argyllshire Advertiser by Tayvallich reader Donald Carmichael, has generated a great deal of interest.After we asked our knowledgeable readers to tell us a little more about the photograph, Lochgilphead#s Murray MacFarlane visited the office to offer some background information on the image.Murray named every member of the team in the photograph, but added: #I was playing rugby as stand-off at that time as well, so I must have had a hangover or something when the photo was taken.#He recalled that Mid Argyll Rugby Club played in the Glasgow District League and only just missed out on promotion to the national leagues during the s.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Fulmar got off equal first with half a dozen others and the Bosun, at the tiller, is reported to have had a look of near terror on his face. If he had known that one of the yachts, Sinbad, had lost its rudder during the melee and was virtually out of control he would probably have been more frightened. Two boats, Islay and Saionara, were in trouble with burst and torn mainsails. Fulmar held her position well and was among the first half dozen boats up to Colintraive but thereafter the wind fell light and they got stuck in the south narrows and nearly all the boats passed them – those taking the north channel scoring very decisively.Down the Kerry Kyle they recovered some of the lost ground but when they rounded Ardlamont they were still well down in the tail. They passed through the Skate and this paid handsomely as they got a tremendous lt up the east shore and passed boat after boat – those out in the middle of the loch got stuck and never got going again. Seewolf was lying rd or th at the Skate but she crossed the line a very bad last of the whole fleet. A spell of very calm weather followed while Fulmar was away over at Kilfinnan but, a light air coming away, they managed to cross over to the west shore and there got quite a nice little breeze which brought them along splendidly till they reached the buoys south of the breakwater then it died – absolutely. And it took them half an hour to do the distance.Next day, in a strong easterly, they had a slow and strenuous trip through the canal to Crinan then, borrowing Davie Weston’s dinghy to save launching their own, they went straight out and anchored off the canal entrance.There was a straggling start at .am on Monday owing to there being no gun and no one quite knew when to go but followed Arcturus when she gave a lead. Fulmar was moderately well placed about the middle of the ruck. A quite steady easterly gave them a quick passage to Fladda but, off Sheep, it fell light and all were becalmed. This, of course, suited Fulmarfine as no one was moving and, as long as this was the case, she was piling up a fine credit balance of handicap minutes. She tried to keep as well up to the eastward as possible but did not quite succeed in passing east of Sheep island as Arcturus did .A puffer coming south with her smoke trailing away to the west gave them a hint which few,any, of the others took and they held more and more to the east and, as a consequence, got the first of a fresh easterly breeze and swept past boat after boat, most of which had held down to Mull. By the time they got to Duart and were able to bring the breeze dead astern they were well up in the first half and well ahead of their time allowance. Thereafter it was just a question of #Would the wind hold # Provided it did so they felt they had an excellent chance as, with the hold-up at Sheep, they had accumulated more than half an hour of handicap from the leading boats and had lots in hand for those but a little ahead of them.The wind did hold and Fulmar won the Tobermory Cup and the st prize for the second section of the race which with Saturday’s second prize made a very good showing for the weekend.The Mate, Tar and Skipper, were following the race as best they could from the shore. When they came down Loch Fyne side it was a dead calm and they were very surprised when they got to Tarbert to see the boats, half hidden in the rain, coming round Ardlamont – they had no inkling of the breezy start. In Loch Fyne they watched the very slow progress, then the rain cleared off and they were glad to see the big lt Fulmar got up the east shore after going through Skate. For the last two or three hours things went desperately slowly till late-ish in the evening a little breeze brought in the leading boards but it died and left Fulmar no further from the finishing line than the buoys south of the breakwater – she was well up and ahead of several in the big class and most of the small class. She had only about  yards to do when she stopped and, after hurriedly working out the elapsed time handicaps, the Skipper found she had  minutes in which to do them but she failed by a little over two minutes to do it. The Skipper thought she had won as he thought Vanda had been the leader up till then and it was a disappointment when, checking up, he discovered Sally of Kames was ahead of Vanda and had saved her time by two minutes on Fulmar.The start from Crinan was at .am and the Skipper, Tar and Mate got up at .and went across to see them go. The start was a bit of a fiasco as the officials slept in but all the boatsgot off more or less together. As it happens it was perhaps a good thing as, with all the boats starting together on a short line and with the strong easterly breeze that was then blowing there might, too easily, have been some nasty accidents.The Tar, Skipper and Mate went back to their beds then after breakfast went to Oban with little expectation of seeing anything more of the boats. Again they were surprised when, on going to the summit of the Pulpit Hill in Oban, they saw the leading boats just coming up to Duart – they did not know anything of the hold-up at Sheep.Anxiously they watched a number of boats come into view round a hill on Kerrera and were more than pleased when, well up amongst the leaders and passing boat after boat as they watched, they saw the red gaff sails of Fulmar reaching up the Firth of Lorn then running up the Sound of Mull. They watched until most of the boats were well out of recognition distance up the Sound then went home confident thatconditions remained as they were Fulmar had more than a good chance of winning that leg of the race and, with luck, the whole thing.Extract from The Glasgow Herald of Tuesday, July : #Clyde Cruising ClubIn the early hours of yesterday morning the yachts of the Clyde Cruising Club set off from Crinan on the nd leg of their face from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory. The first part of the race ended at Ardrishaig, after which the yachts went through the Crinan Canal.The winners at Ardrishaig were:-Class . st Sally of Kamesh m s.nd Fulmarh m srd Vandah m sExtract from the Glasgow Herald of Monday, July :-Clyde Cruising ClubThe  yachts which raced from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory under the burgee of the Clyde Cruising Club got a rare dusting and with as much wind as they wished the bigger boats came into their own. The  ton cutter Fulmar, which distinguished herself many years ago as one of the few finishers in a stormy Fastnet race, won the Tobermory Cup for the large class, and the  ton sloop Trefoil captured the Torridon Cup for the small class.Driven hard from Port Bannatyne by a fresh easterly, the yachts found a calm patch off Ardrishaig, but they were blown through the canal to Crinan, where the second leg of the race was sailed in a good easterly breeze, resulting in fast passages.

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this.

The shambles surrounding two new ferries to serve Arran and the Hebrides now has the Scottish taxpayer on the hook for at least pound million, in what is merely the latest example of an embarrassing and costly public project that has run aground.Ferguson Marine, which won the contract in  and went under last year with debts of pound million before being taken into public ownership, blames the Scottish Government and CMAL, another state-owned company that owns the ferries run by CalMac. CMAL claims that Ferguson began work before agreeing final specications, and that cost overruns were its responsibility.Meanwhile, CalMac says that it never wanted dual fuel vessels, using marine diesel and liquefied natural gas , and Jim McColl, the industrialist who took on Fergusonrsquos in , says the system would never have provided a benefit.The Scottish Government stands accused of having insisted on LNG as a green gimmick, and of prematurely announcing the order to steal a march on a Tory spending commitment at Faslane, made on the same day by the then Chancellor, George Osborne.If, as the Scottish Governmentrsquos former adviser Luke van Beek suggests, there was a breakdown in communication, and that the brief for the project was dangerously vague, it can certainly be charged with having failed to provide adequate scrutiny of how public money was being spent, and to have stepped in to prevent matters becoming worse.After the fiascos at ScotRail and the hospital builds in Glasgow, Edinburgh and now Aberdeen, this is becoming a dismally familiar complaint. The latest mess ndash which holds up to ridicule both our proud shipbuilding heritage and the basic competence of Holyrood ndash is a particular embarrassment, and demands an urgent public inquiry. This, too, is a depressingly familiar call.Ministers have been far too ready to make excuses, dodge responsibility and ndash always a favoured tactic ndash accuse critics of ldquotalking Scotland down. If the SNP wishes to demonstrate that independence is a credible political option , it needs to begin operating with the basic level of competence citizens expect and deserve.The greatest service the SNP could perform for the nationalist cause is not to attempt to rerun the last referendum, nor to manufacture grievances to lob at Westminster, but to give the electorate evidence that politicians at Holyrood are capable of performing the tasks fundamental to government.That means upholding standards in public services, demonstrating responsible stewardship of the taxpayersrsquo money, ensuring infrastructure projects deliver the intended result and provide value for money and, above all, accepting that the responsibility for failure ultimately rests with ministers.Examples such as Crossrail and HS demonstrate that such failings are not unique to Scotland they are a perpetual risk in all government spending. But that is why the public is entitled to expect ministers to be vigilant against waste, delay and a failure to deliver. Scotlandrsquos record is undeniably poor.The Government at Holyrood is gaining an unfortunate reputation for expensive failures of this sort. Their apparent casual disregard for their basic duties, and for what the Scottish people have a right to expect, is a disservice to Scotland as a competent and capable nation which can attend to its own affairs. That,nothing , should alarm the SNP, since it is an indictment not only of the competence of their current administration, but of their fundamental ambition."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-hotel-boom-continues-25m-plan-gets-nod","story":"The project, which will include a -bedroom hotel with bar and roof terrace alongside retail space, will be developed on the corner of Trongate and Hutcheson Street.

message to the nation.She said: \"A lot of people at home who have dogs or cats will call them pets and refer to themselves as owners and this implies that the animals are a possession, like a car, for example.\"White also discussed PETAs mission to change common phraseology that include animal references. The old mantra \"bring home the bacon\" would become \"bring home the bagels\" and rather than saying \"kill two birds with one stone\", we should instead plump for \"feed two birds with one scone\".Which sounds less like it is raising awareness about animal welfare than it does a series of cheesy advertising slogans to promote a homespun bakery. Also, the organisation is called PETA: the word pet is actually in the name.Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan promptly rubbished PETAs suggestions ndash reminding White that the word \"pet\" comes from the Scottish Gaelic \"peata\", which means \"tame animal\" ndash and I found myself agreeing with him.Thanks a lot, Jenner.

Funnily enough, it is not being roused from your slumber in the dead of night by the gently prodding snout of a cheeky-yet-adorable collie.Research by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology suggests that harsh alarm tones might be linked to increased levels of morning grogginess, while melodic tunes could improve alertness. The crux: out with beep, beep, beep and in with the good vibrations of the Beach Boys.Choosing an alarm tone is a tricky business. I have a friend who swears by waking up to the soothing crooning of Enya, while another insists upon seven alarms simultaneously blaring out what sounds like an air-raid siren warning of imminent nuclear attack.The one time I shared a hotel room with the latter friend it took the best part of four hours and several stf drinks before my heart rate ed to anything resembling normal.Personally, I use my iPhone clock as an alarm which is grand.

The world will stop this evening to watch a carnival of wealth, adulation, fame, talent, glamour and ndash most of all ndash power. It is a night bestowed with global signicance. Millions around the planet see it as the cultural and artistic heart of the year. Wersquore told that the Oscars matter.But is that true  Do the Oscars say anything about the world we live in, about our culture, our society  Or is it all, as the cynics believe, just an empty, gaudy show that signies nothing Who decides First of all, letrsquos be clear what the Oscars are. Like their British equivalent, the Baftas, the Oscars are an expression of how a very narrow sliver of society sees both culture and the world at a specic moment in time. When it comes to the Oscars, that sliver of society is the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.It is the academyrsquos roughly , members who hand out the gongs. All members are part of the film industry ndash directors, cinematographers, producers ndash but actors make up the biggest proportion, %.Of the academyrsquos active voters, % are white, % male and % over , and about one-third are former Oscar nominees and winners. Given wersquore in Hollywood, the academy also has a liberal bias. Right-wing movies ndash unless yoursquore Clint Eastwood ndash donrsquot get far.For such a youthful art form as cinema, the old, white, wealthy, male demographic is jarring ndash and it lies at the heart of the Oscarsrsquo ersity problem, with not enough black or female artists up for awards.The question of raceThe movie Green Book, which won Oscars in  for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Mahershala Ali, is a good case study when it comes to liberalism and ersity.In an elevator pitch it sounds the perfect pro-ersity film: a white, working-class man learns to be a better person by working for an intellectual black man.The only problem is the film was hammered for its ldquowhite saviour narrative. In the film, the black guy only learns about himself thanks tothe white guy. Green Book was criticised for perpetuating a fantasy that racism only happened in thepast ndash itrsquos set in the s ndash ratherthan today.Green Book is a perfect example of Hollywood trying to be liberal, but falling on its face with a story about black le filtered through white eyes. If the academy wanted to hand the Best Picture Oscar to a ldquogood film about race last year it could have awarded BlacKkKlansman by Spike Lee.American powerSo the Oscars represent a very narrow worldview. They also represent a very American worldview. Of course, America is the planetrsquos cultural powerhouse, but the Oscars crowd out the vast majority of films which donrsquot come from the English-speaking world.The rules have a built-in bias against foreign films. Any contender for the big awards ndash Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay ndash must play for seven nights in LA. That might be hard for a brilliant but broke filmmaker from Africa or Asia.The nominee for Best Foreign Film doesnrsquot have to open in America ndash but it does have to be its countryrsquos official selection, which in itself is a mountainous task of networking, campaigning and schmoozing.The schmoozeSpeaking of schmoozing ndash thatrsquos the other problem which erodes belief in the Oscars having real cultural signicance. If you want your film to win you need deep pockets.Winning an Oscar is all about campaigning ndash and campaigning costs. In , Doctor Dolittle was a turkey. Over budget, critically hated and a box office disaster, it still managed to get a Best Picture nomination, and eventually won Best Song and Visual Effects after th Century Fox launched a champagne-fuelled charm offensive for Academy members.In , the schmaltzy Shakespeare In Love beat Saving Private Ryan when Harvey Weinsteinrsquos studio Miramax spent an unheard-of  million on an Oscar campaign.Money, however, does not buy cultural signicance, or lasting appeal. Who cares about Shakespeare InLove today The golden ageSo the Oscars have more than their fair share of problems ndash and itrsquos hardto argue that the awards, as a whole, have something consistently signicant to say about the world, cultureand society.However, that doesnrsquot mean inidual Oscar-winning films arenrsquot important. Many speak directly about societyrsquos big issues, the problems confronting the world and the changing shape of culture. When the Academy gets it right ndash which isnrsquot often ndash it gets it very right.The seventies is a good era to explore ndash after all, itrsquos the golden age of modern cinema. In , Kramer vs Kramer swept the boards, winning five Oscars including Best Picture. It stars Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, and tells the story of their orce. The film focuses a lot on their child, Billy, caught in the middle.Billy was a symbol of generation X ndash the first generation to grow up with orce normalised. The film explores gender roles ndash who should raise a kid and why  ndash womenrsquos rights, fathersrsquo rights, the growing demands of corporate careerism, work-le balance and single parenthood. Kramer vs Kramer was socially astute and culturally ahead of its time.That same year Apocalypse Now won two technical Oscars ndash Cinematography and Sound. Today, itrsquos Francis Ford Coppolarsquos film which has stood the test of time much more than Kramer vs Kramer.Divorce is no longer a zeitgeist subject, but Apocalypse Now continues to say something culturally signicant: that Western power is dangerous. Often it is films which are nominated for Oscars, but donrsquot scoop the Best Picture award, which make the most interesting cultural statements. In , the academy basically replicated what happened the year before ndash it gave four big gongs to another family drama, Ordinary People.However, Raging Bull ndash hailed as one of the greatest movies ever made, and a film which has easily outlasted its Oscar rivals ndash only won two awards, including Best Actor for Robert De Niro as the boxer Jake LaMotta. It was a study in ldquotoxic masculinity decades before the term was coined.Sometimes, though, the academy just goes a bit mad ndash like in  when it gave four Oscars to Network but still handed the Best Picture award to Sylvester Stallonersquos Rocky. Network is a brutal, brilliant satire, which still says something culturally signicant about the media and society.War: where it all beganIf we go right back to the first Oscars, in , we see the Best Picture winner, the war film Wings, struggling to make sense of the First World War. The US Library of Congress has listed Wings, which starred early screen idol Clara Bow, as a film of ldquocultural signicance because it was a real pioneer in the industry.The following year, , saw cinema still wrestling with the aftermath of war and looming danger in Europe. All Quiet On The Western Front was the big winner. After protests by the Nazi Party in Germany, the film proved its cultural signicance by promptly getting banned.The Second World War profoundly affected the Oscars as neutral America tilted towards Britain. Gone With The Wind ndash although racially unsettling today ndash made clear that war was monstrous. It beat The Wizard Of Oz to the Best Picture award in . Oz, though, summed up better the sense of dislocation, confusion, fear and nostalgia sweeping a world facing global conflict.In , British and American culture fused when Mrs Miniver ndash which tells the story of an ordinary English housewe during wartime ndash took six Oscars, including Best Picture, Director and Actress . Casablanca won Best Picture the following year with a clear message about Americarsquos attachment to Europe: wersquoll always have Paris.The big issuesAs the years march on, we see that so many Oscar nominees were commercially successful but artistic non-entities. The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, anyone Still, a few of the Best Picture winners stand out, capturing perfectly the spirit of the times in which they were made. On The Waterfront, which won Best Picture in , looks at le from a uniquely th-century working-class perspective. West Side Story in  used the cover of a musical to tackle immigration.In , though, To Kill A Mockingbird ndash a film fuelled by the US civil rights movement ndash lost out to Lawrence Of Arabia. David Leanrsquos epic is a visual delight, but itrsquos a clunking and colonial take on the Arab world.In The Heat Of The Night, the  drama starring Sidney Poitier as a black detective in the Deep South,won Best Picture and put African-Americans front and centre. In , homosexuality was explored in Midnight Cowboy, although the film is critiqued for homophobia today.Mental illness was the theme in when Best Picture went to One Flew Over The Cuckoorsquos Nest. Gandhi in  turned attention to colonialism. Rain Man in  looked at autism ndash albeit in an exceptionally misinformed way. And American Beauty in  grappled with the crisis in masculinity.IdentityFrom the turn of the millennium, it is often who the filmmaker is rather than the film theyrsquove created which makes the biggest cultural statement. The Hurt Locker took six Oscars in  and made history when Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win Best Director. An emotionally astute war film, it signalled the power dynamic between the sexes shting both in Hollywood and across the west.Then, in , Moonlight took Best Picture. Itrsquos a film about being black, gay and poor, by a black writer-director, Barry Jenkins, and with an all-black cast. Itrsquos one of those films which crystallised the time in which it was made ndash in Moonlightrsquos case right in the middle of Black Lives Matter.In , the bizarre fairy tale The Shape Of Water won Best Picture. Beneath the surface lay an examination of female sexuality, with all its quirks and wonders laid bare. Its central character, played by Sally Hawkins, may be mute but the story is about women finding their voice in the world of men.This yearrsquos nomineesSo what of tonightrsquos Best Picture nominees  Do they speak to our times  Certainly some do. Joker is perhapsthe film with most cultural clout.Some see it as a comment aboutthe left-behind, gun nuts, socially awkward losers and the alt-right.Thatrsquos mistaken, but evenit weretrue it would show a film unafraid of tackling the big social questions.What Joker really explores is the increasing isolation of modern le, the breakdown of community, the corruption of decency in an amoral world. In the era of social media, hate, and disinformation, Joker couldnrsquot be more of its time. It speaks directly to the experience wersquore all going through right now.However, itrsquos unlikely Joker will win Best Picture ndash though Joaquin Phoenix should be a cert for Best Actor. Joker is too edgy for the academy to give it the top prize.The most likely winner is . Wartime heroism wins awards ndash think Schindlerrsquos List and The Pianist. The only thing that wins more awards than wartime bravery is Meryl Streep ndash nominated a record  times.Sam Mendesrsquo First World War film does speak of something prevalent in our society ndash nostalgia for a glorious past. The veneration of the past lurks within the rise of Western populism. Thatrsquos not to say  isnrsquot a good film, it is ndash itrsquos just that it says something a little disturbing about our current cultural obsessions.The gangster epic The Irishman sees Martin Scorsesenot just to form but also old ground as he rummages through the undergrowth of toxic masculinity again. Jojo Rabbit, a dark fairy tale about le in the Hitler Youth, may seem quirkybut itrsquos also back on safe Oscar territory: wartime heroism.Like Greta Gerwigrsquos multi-nominated Lady Bird in , Little Womencontinuesthe rebalancing of the cultural scalesby telling stories specically about women and by women. The Netflix movie Marriage Story is essentially a Kramer vs Kramer reboot for millennials.Ford v Ferrari finds itself in the slot marked ldquowell-made film that no-one particularly cares about. Still, it had enough star power to ensure nominations. In terms of cultural import, itrsquos al. Think The Big Short from  ndash nominated for five awards, won one. In a decade, few will remember it.Quentin Tarantinorsquos Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is fun, but itrsquos really just an in-joke for Tinsel Town. For comparison, therersquos Robert Altmanrsquos  movie The Player ndash it too was Hollywood on Hollywood and earned a clutch of nominations. Again, few remember or care today.Parasite is the oddball in the mix. Firstly itrsquos foreign ndash and although foreign films rarely make it into the Best Picture category, the last few years saw things change with The Artist, which inexplicably won in , and Roma, which inexplicably lost to Green Book last year.Could a South Korean comedy-horror win Best Picture  If wersquore judging a film on what it says about culture and society then Parasite should be a leading contender. If you want a movie which explores lersquos inequalities and the deadly nature of the rich-poor ide, then pick Parasite.Who emerges as top dog all depends on whether this is a year when the academy gets it right, and rewards a film which explains where we are right now when it comes to culture and society ndash orthe academy gets it wrong and just slaps a gold star on what it thinks is an important film, but is in reality just an ephemeral piece of entertaining fluff which says nothing about the world."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-gardens-scheme-peek-secret-spaces","story":"In a tiny corner of what was once Glasgowrsquos shipbuilding heartland, bordered by a steel spiked fence and overlooked by a car park, a garden oasis waits to wake from its slumber.Lovingly created on a derelict site of a former shipyard, the delphiniums, ornamental grasses and gerbera of the Duchess of Montrose Memorial Garden have brightened its small corner of Govan since it openedlast summer.Normally restricted to a select few visitors, the city garden is tiny compared with the manicured grandeur of Gardyne Castle,  miles north in Angus, with its perfectly pruned knot garden, bluebell wood, fishpond and immaculate lawn.Meanwhile, at the rear of a fairly ordinary semi-detached house in an ordinary street in Ayrshire, therersquos an extraordinary garden growing ndash exotic tree ferns, towering bamboo and feathery palms have turned what wasa bog-standard Scottish back garden with typically crumbling shed and untameable ivy into a minitropical jungle.For gardeners who have not been blessed with a single green finger, these and dozens of other lovingly nurtured and weather-defying gardens are either something to aim for or a reason to just throw in the trowel.They are among hundreds of gardens up and down the country now being pruned and planted in preparation for Scotlandrsquos Gardens Scheme, an annual showcase which celebrates the often hidden beauty of the nationrsquos private havens, community allotments and therapeutic school and retirement home gardens.Many of the  gardens taking part are labours of love, growing in defiance of wild Scottish weather and carefully cultivated by gardeners more likely to be found dusting the rose bushes than relaxing on a recliner wondering why the freesias have died.Around % of gardens involved in this yearrsquos scheme feature specially created wildle areas designed to attract birds, bees, butterflies and bugs ndash inspiration, the organisers hope, for visitors to encourage bioersity in their own gardens.The scheme sees gardens open to visitors at certain times throughout the year or by appointment, and includes  which will open for the first time ndash among them social support charity The Preshal Trustrsquos Govan garden.Some seem to defy the odds: at the most northerly garden, Norby at Burnside in Sandness, Shetland, Chinese tree peonies, shrub roses, lilies, hellebores, and grasses fromNew Zealand thrive despite the exposed landscape.And at Leathad Ard, Upper Carloway on Lewis, the owners refused to be deterred by the westerly winds, challenging hillside setting and surrounding peat bog to create a garden of colourful herbaceous borders, exposed beds packed with delicate blooms, fruit orchards, and vegetable patches.The scheme asks visitors to pay a small fee to visit each garden which then goes towards a range of charities, infor a look at often hidden back gardens and private woodlands where wildle thrive, and snowdrops and bluebells carpet the floor.Visitors who make an appointment to visit  Burnton Road in Dalrymple will step from a typical Ayrshire street tino a tropical haven. ldquoThe garden was fairly awful when we moved here, says David Blatchford, who since  has transformed the triangular corner plot into a welcoming jungle.ldquoBack then it was just a lawn, a gigantic leylandii, ivy and a crumbling shed.While that may sound like most Scottish gardens, David and his we Margaret planned ahead and brought favourite tree ferns and bamboo from their former property to plant.With the leylandii, ivy and shed gone, they created raised beds to tackle the dearth of topsoil and laid a serpentine path which now meanders through the dense, lush foliage, past giant, glossy leaves and towering palms.Bonsai and potted terrestrial ferns including rare blechnum species and succulents rest on the patio. Outside, hardy and tender bromeliads and aroids share space with lilies, cannas, gingers and bursts of Mexicanfeather grass.At the front of the garden, dahlias and a Chinese imported buddleia bring bursts of colour and dozens of red admiral butterflies.ldquoWe do have time to sit in the garden and enjoy it, he adds. ldquoAnd we do have a washing line ndash you just donrsquot see it hidden behind the bamboo.Around three hoursrsquo drive away, at Barochreal in Kilninver near Oban, a remarkable -year labour of love has seen its hard-working owners, Nigel and Antoinette Mitchell, scrape and shovel scrub grass and old sheep pens into a colourful haven.The pretty garden which hugs their white-walled, two-storey home buzzes with bees from their hives.A wild garden and rockery complement a rose garden created from a former sheep fank while raised beds have been made using stone left behind when the old dairy was taken down. Further on, their  acres extend to a waterfall and a small glen where  species of moth and more than  species of wildflowers thrive, including three types of wild orchid, and red squirrels and pine martens make their home.ldquoItrsquos slowly evolved, says Antoinette. ldquoAs one thing is done, another comes up. It takes all our energy to keep it going.

Created from a field, the garden reflects the ecclesiastical history of the island, and includes a vegetable garden, a tree nursery, a physic garden and orchard.It is framed by standing stones, meadows and mountains, while rare breed Shetland horned cattle roam.Meanwhile, Bruckills Croft in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, home of award-winning wildle gardener Helen Rushton, has a butterfly alley, wildflower meadow and pond.Other gardens have touching stories behind them.

rarest of them all, is usually found hiding behind a cairn, up a tree or curled up in a ball, snoozing.At noon most days, however, visitors to the Highland Wildle Park at Kincraig near Aviemore will be treated to a fleeting glimpse of its bushy tail, mean green-yellow eyes and thick fur, as one of the nationrsquos most elusive creatures emerges to snatch a lump of meat for lunch before retreating to the shadows.For most park visitors, that brief glimpse of the Scottish wildcats is at the top of their list of must-see attractions, possibly alongside Hamish the juvenile polar bear, a national treasure and the first cub born in the UK for  years, and the Amur tiger.What they wonrsquot see, however, is a massive behind-the-scenes effort spanning the UK and Europe, and which itrsquos hoped will throw a leline to ensuring Scottish wildcats ndash  times more endangered than the giant panda ndash will not just be around for generations to come, but could eventually become established in locations right across Scotland.Tucked out of sight on a patch of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotlandrsquos park which is out of bounds to visitors, a new wildcat reintroduction centre is about to become \"ground zero\" for the survival of a fragile species entwined in Scottish national identity but currently in a fierce catfight for its very survival.A combination of cross-breeding with feral and domestic cats, habitat loss, road accidents, historic persecution and disease has all but wiped out the purest of Scotlandrsquos treasured wildcat population.Left to their own devices, the tiny number with genes not already severely diluted from mating with outsiders, will dwindle, fade and disappear.Hopes are now pinned on a pound. million scheme led by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotlandand, almost certainly, some amorous intervention from the speciesrsquo closest European cousins to help the Scottish wildcat get back on its feet.By the end of this year, the first wildcats will be in settled in at the new reintroduction centre,  breeding pairs which ndash assuming nature takes it course ndash should produce enough healthy offspring to see  wildcats reintroduced to carefully picked spots in the Cairngorms over a three-year period.Eventually itrsquos hoped they could be reintroduced where in Scotland ndash raising the possibility of the creatures becoming commonplace across the country.Although, according to David Barclay, cat conservation project officer with the RZSS who currently oversees the  wildcats in the UK-wide breeding programme, the first challenge is to save the handful of remaining Scottish wildcats from extinction.ldquoTherersquos perhaps a very small number of wildcats left in Scotland, he admits. ldquoAnd we have a lot of evidence that says the population is non-viable.ldquoWithout putting more wildcats back, they will almost certainly go extinct in the next few years.ldquoWildcats are in that short list of animals that are iconic species for Scotland, such as the golden eagle and the red squirrel, he adds.ldquoFor Scotland not to have wildcats would be a very sad day.At Kincraig, a recent pound.million EU LIFE grant added to funding from the Garfield Weston Foundation, the National Trust for Scotland, the Peoplersquos Trust for Endangered Species and the European Nature Trust, has enabled work to start on building the new centre.A recruitment drive is now under way to find  staff while plans are being drawn up for a major campaign to encourage domestic cat owners to neuter their pets to avoid the main threat to wildcatsrsquo future, hybridisation.Feral or domestic cats that enter the wildcat reserve will be trapped, neutered, vaccinated and released.Most of the  breeding pairs are expected to be sourced mainly from the UK-wide wildcat breeding programme but some are likely to make the journey from Europe, in particular Spain, where wildcats have been found to share physical similarities to their Scottish relations, and populations are more stable.It may sound like a further erosion of the Scottish wildcatsrsquo precious gene pool, however Mr Barclay insists the European presence will strengthen, not weaken, the wildcatsrsquo chances of survival.ldquoThe European wildcats will improve the gene pool, he states. ldquoThe cat we have is a European wildcat, itrsquos just a dferent population thatrsquos more critically endangered.ldquoIf we have to bring some cats from Europe ndash and it would be a relatively small number ndash we would want to bring them from a population where we feel that there are similarities with Scottish cat.ldquoAnd Spanish wildcats look very similar to Scottish wildcats.ldquoIf you bring wildcats from Europe, you are bringing new genetic material which gives Scottish wildcats a boost in terms of the gene pool.The fight to save Scotlandrsquos wildcats has already crossed international boundaries: as well as working with Scottish Natural Heritage, the Cairngorms National Park Authority and Forestry and Land Scotland, the RSZZ Saving Wildcats project ndash the only official wildcats project in the country ndash is partnered with Swedish wildle park Nordenrsquos Ark, and Spainrsquos Junta De Andaluciacutea, which led the successful recovery of the Iberian lynx.It has been boosted by the arrival of two potential \"Adam and Eve\" wildcats: male and female, both accidentally trapped, both found to have surprisingly strong wildcat genes.While the male is now at an English zoo where itrsquos hoped nature will soon play its part in boosting wildcat numbers, the female, Lossie, has already produced five kittens from two litters.Last year, one of her offspring, Katrine, delivered her first litter ndash four kittens, each carrying on its tiny shoulders the future of a species which has roamed Scotlandrsquos hills since the Ice Age.ldquoFor next few years itrsquos about getting all the right tools in one place so we can create a viable, sustainable population of wildcats in one location, adds Mr Barclay.ldquoOnce we have been through that process and know that the reintroduction technology works, then we can replicate that across Scotland.ldquoThe crucial element is controlling the threat: we canrsquot release them until the threat is removed, and one of the biggest threats in hybrid and domestic cats.The reintroduction of wildcats would follow in the wake of the reintroduction of sea eagles, water voles and beavers to the wild ndash each native to Scotland but brought to extinction through hunting and loss of habitat.The wildcatsrsquocould also pave the way for other animals including lynx and wolves.

This, after all, was how Scotlandrsquos nationalised ferry company was colloquially known.Now, a company called CalMac Ferries Limited, or CML, still operates most ferries on Clyde and Hebridean routes. It is based out of Gourock ferry terminal and is owned by a business called David MacBrayne Limited or DML, which is wholly owned by the Scottish Government.CML operates  vessels and  harbours, almost of all of which are owned by another body with an almost identical acronym, CMAL.This is Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited. CMAL, rather than CML, is the direct corporate successor of the old Caledonian MacBrayne company and it officially lists its foundation as .:Scotlands ferry fiasco: meet the eight people who run CMALIn effect, CMAL owns most of Scotlandrsquos ferries ndash including three operated by private company Sercoon subsidised routes to and from Orkney and Shetland ndash and many of the nationrsquos ferry ports. Like CML, CMAL is owned by the Scottish Government.This has been how ferries have been run in Scotland since the last year of the old Scottish Executive. CML has secured successive franchisesto run services using CMAL assets. Both CMAL and CML are companies, owned by the Government, not Government departments.CMAL, using Government money, has been responsible for investing in ports and procuring vessels. The theory  That this arrangement ndash rather like in the railways ndash allows a free market of sorts. The reality  Ultimately, it is the taxpayer who owns, runs, subsidises ndash and now builds ndash the ferries.In the saga of the purchase of the two now massively overdue and over budget new ships, it is CMAL that has come under fire.The companyrsquos HQ is in Port Glasgowrsquos historic town buildings, less than a -minute stroll from the shipyard where the hulks of two botched ferries, the Glen Sannox and the unnamed Hull , lie rusting.The yard ndash Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited or FMEL world of ferries ndash is now also owned by the Scottish Government after it was nationalised following the failure of the contract.The yard had been bought ndash rescued, it was reported ndash by tax exile Jim McColl.An independent report by FMEL after its Government takeover painted a picture of amateurish mismanagement at the yard before nationalisation, including basic failures to keep track of stock and clean-up.However, supporters of McColl have long briefed against CMAL and its executives. Last week, the businessman took aim at his one-time customers again. His point: they should not exist at all.ldquoWe donrsquot need CMAL to be there, the businessman told MSPs investigating how his contract had failed. ldquoBefore, it worked perfectly well with CalMac. It is surplus to requirements.McColl said CMAL executives had been civil in person but described a relationship which, via email, became testier. The businessman blames changes to spec on the boats he built from CMAL. The old CalMac, he said, ldquoknew what they wanted. His implication  CMAL does not.CMAL chief executive Kevin Hobbs will get his chance to speak later.

The tale is not strictly accurate, however. On the first day of coverage there was no mention of Aberdeen on the next there was a subheading, ldquoAberdeen people on the Titanic, but it was some way down the page. Still, the legend persists.Over the years, the Scottish media as a whole has become adept at putting a kilt on items when required. Occasionally, London-based political programmes have a chance tothe compliment and feature Scottish stories, but they rarely do.Yesterday was a prime example. As you may have noticed, there was a big story in Scotland last week. Finance Secretary, text messages scandal, having to resign on day of his budget, ring a bell  While one did not expect The Andrew Marr Show and Sky Newsrsquo Ridge on Sunday to take the Derek Mackay story and go wall to wall with it, the subject was surely worth a stand-alone interview.: Beginning of the end for SNP Instead, the line-up on Marr was Liu Xiamoing, the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who is standing for the deputy leadership of Labour, and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland. Sophy Ridge, meanwhile, spoke to Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, Dawn Butler MP, another Labour deputy leadership candidate, former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, and the Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick.Of the two line-ups, perhaps only Ambassador Liu was of direct relevance to viewers in Scotland. Given the threat from coronavirus, what the Chinese Government has to say is of vital importance to everyone on the planet. ldquoWe believe the virus is controllable, preventable, curable, said the ambassador.Nor did Scotland come up in the paper review on Marr. No surprise there, since the Scottish Sunday newspapers do not feature unless the programme has decamped north. Yet Broadcasting House, in many ways the Radio  equivalent of Marrrsquos show, makes a point of inviting Scottish paper reviewers on to the programme now and then, and encourages them to talk about stories from their patch. How dficult would it be for the Marr team to set up a link to Scotland, or Wales and Northern Ireland, to find out what stories are making the headlines in the rest of the UK Perhaps in the case of Marr the thinking was to leave the Mackay story to Sunday Politics Scotland. It was the first topic in host Gordon Brewerrsquos review of the week with Jenni Davidson of Holyrood magazine and Peter Geoghegan, investigative journalist with the website openDemocracy.The main interview was a pre-recorded sit down between Brewer and Keith Brown, Depute Leader of the SNP. The news line from this was Mr Brown, at the third time of asking, saying it was very dficult to see how Derek Mackay could continue as an MSP.: Keith Brown interviewTalk eventually turned to the budget. Some % of people in Scotland were now paying more tax, said Brewer. According to SPICE, Holyroodrsquos research arm, he went on, the Scottish Government raised poundm more than it wouldit stuck with the UK policy. But when the block grant adjustment was taken into account the Scottish Government ended up with just poundm more.ldquoPeople in Scotland might be prepared to pay more taxthey thought the money was going somewhere useful, said Brewer.Brown said the money was going somewhere useful, public services, and that the majority of people in Scotland paid less tax than they would in the rest of the UK. ldquoScotlandrsquos got the lowest tax rate in the whole of the UK,\" he said.Mr Brown, a former Cabinet Secretary for the economy, did not move off the front foot. It was a robust ding-dong, as it should have been, ending with a challenge from Mr Brown when the looming shortfall in tax receipts was brought up.: Put PM on notice on indyrefldquoLook at the whole context in which we have this budget, said the constituency MSP for Clackmannanshire and Dunblane. ldquoI asked you on this programme a year or so ago why you never interview UK finance ministers hellipBrewer interrupted to promptly invite Chancellor Sajid Javid on to the show. ldquoIf hersquos watching, happy to interview him.Why donrsquot UK Ministers come on to Scottish television as a matter of course  You could argue it was not constitutionally polite to ask London-based Ministers when there are opposition politicians here who could step in. Yet such niceties do not stop Ministers commenting regularly on Scottish matters in the Commons. Boris Johnson, indeed, has made it a regular feature of Prime Ministerrsquos Questions.Given the Cabinet boycott of the Today programme and Good Morning Britain, andMr Johnson is as keen on being the Minister for the Union as he says, Number Ten might even welcome sending ministers outside London.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

And, just to be clear, it would be equally as seriousthe teenager in question had been a girl.It is likely there is cross-party agreement that the -year-old Mackay should now stand down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West. However, Nicola Sturgeon was right when she said that “no matter how upset and shocked all of us are in these situations, there’s a need for due process”.Despite the scale of the justied outrage, the full facts need to be established in a calm and considered way. After all, there may be questions for others to answer.It has long been known that those in positions of power will sometimes abuse it, but the MeToo movement should have spelt out the full consequences to anyone failing to grasp them.Once such conduct might have been brushed under the carpet, but society has changed, considerably and for the better, in refusing to tolerate it.MSPs are the democratically elected leaders of this country and their actions must be beyond reproach. It is, or at least should be, part of their job to send a message to those in positions of power in wider society about what is and is not acceptable behaviour.And an MSP, let alone a Cabinet minister, sending scores of unsolicited messages of the type described to a -year-old is, in the words of the First Minister, “unacceptable”.

People are so fed up with referendums they would reject that, and actually the support for independence, given we have a Boris Johnson government in Westminster, should be stronger than it is.\"Liam Kerr of the Scottish Conservatives said it was times to \"end uncertainty and constitutional wrangling\", and for the SNP to \"concentrate on the day job\".And Scottish Greens co-convener, Patrick Harvie, who support independence, also cast doubt on the idea. He said: \"A referendum is far clearerit stays out of the courts, thats the way to create mess, we need to carry on making the case in terms of principle.\" Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, also rejected Ms Cherrys suggestion and said: ldquoThe majority of people in Scotland donrsquot want a isive second independence referendum, and want the SNP Government to get on with the job it was elected to do.ldquoTrying to break up the UK via the back door through an unofficial contest is simply not acceptable and would end up in a huge cost to the public purse - taking money away from leline services.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring.

I’ve written about music and been to a lot of concerts over the years. The list below is typical of the tracks that stand out in my memory. I haven’t mentioned the Small Faces or Bruce Springsteen, SLF or other old favourites. I like to hear a lot of contemporary music too. Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"queens uni supporting the spar craic","story":"QUEEN’S University are the latest institution to show their support to the annual SPAR Craic K taking place on St Patrick’s Day throughout the city.Starting at the gates of City Hall, the route will take in the Gaeltacht Quarter as well as the prestigious university, Botanic Avenue and Gardens before the finish line at Ormeau Park.

When something is so integral to yourself, that was very dficult, he said.You have a constant internal dialogue and you hope it will change and then you find out that you just have to live with it. I didn#t know anybody who was gay at that stage. It is a very isolated situation to be in.Meeting his future we at University of Ulster when the pair were students at the age of , the couple eventually had one son. Mr Creelan also forged a career within the RUC and PSNI, eventually reaching the rank of inspector, before his retirement a number of years ago.Mr Creelan explained that it was the death of close gay friend in the force, Constable Darren Bradshaw, who was murdered in May , which prompted him to announce his inner feelings to his family.I guess it was in . I was in the police at that stage. For me I had wanted to do it for a long time, but it was the death of Darren and having to deal with that professionally that prompted me, he said.I was talking to my we about him and his death and that#s when we dealt with things.Her family reacted really badly at the time. We were still living together and trying to make things work. Once her family had found out, that became impossible. I was already not involved with my own family.You think you can make it work and when we separated our friends didn#t know why. I suppose I thought maybe she might know, but she had no idea whatsoever. It was a very brutal discovery.He added: When it happened, I had a very negative reaction and so it cost a lot in terms of friends and family at the time. With me, nothing had been going on other than what was in my head. My son would have been about nine at that time.My we and I had - child care and eventually when he was ready and wanted to ask the questions, he was told what the situation was.As a parent I didn#t change. Just as I took being married seriously, I took the job of being a parent seriously.From the dficult days of the past, Vincent now celebrates the immensely positive relationship he has with his son and grandson.I am in the very privileged position of being gay and being a parent and grandfather. I have a really great le with my partner, he said.I had a great career and I have a lovely family. As a -year-old now, the journey I have had the past  years is amazing. I am lucky I have a son who is  now and is one of my best friends. I look after my grandson very regularly.In that regard I am a firm believer that le gets better when you come out.Giving his reaction to ITV host Schofield public announcement on Friday, the Newtownards man said the support shown to Mr Schofield could shine a light for others.He has obviously been having those discussions with his family, which is a mature thing to do, he added.I do think he is in a great position to really say that this is a good, positive thing.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Since diagnosis they have received the much needed help and support of Goldenhar UK, a charity run by families and volunteers affected by the extremely rare syndrome.Now Aodhans uncle hopes to be able to give something back by raising cash and swapping the backdrop of the Celtic Park for the Efel Tower in a fundraising drive.Marty told the County Derry Post: “It’s a very rare condition – I think  in  suffer from it and it’s visible from birth.“Obviously, neither my sister nor I had ever heard of it but she noticed that something wasn’t right. The doctors didn’t pick up on it but I suppose the condition is so rare that they hadn’t seen it before.“My sister had to push but the doctors then realised and to be fair to them they’ve been more than helpful. Some have come over from England to see Aodhan.The John Mitchels Claudy captain added: “It will affect the development of bones like his spine, but they won’t know completely until he grows up and they see more and more how it’s affecting him.“He will have to go through a few minor surgeries just to correct a few things and whenever he starts learning to stand, it’ll affect him that way, but he’s now eight months old and is developing into a happy, lively wee child.”Goldenhar Syndrome is so rare that initially Marty’s sister Catherine assumed they were alone in being affected in Northern Ireland, but since he posted his fundraising efforts online, others have been in touch.“My sister didn’t know that there was anyone  in Northern Ireland with the condition, but as soon as I put up the fundraiser, we’ve been contacted by a local lady who was able to provide my sister with a lot of information and they’re actually meeting up now.“I think there are cases in Northern Ireland but they don’t have a  or a chance to talk about it or help each other.”Marty opted for the Paris marathon despite other, closer alternatives and he is looking forward to taking on the challenge in its picturesque surroundings.“Ah, it was just more attractive. I don’t like running anyway but I just thought ‘why not ’ London is nearly impossible to get into so the Paris one was easy enough to get into and it’s probably nicer to run round than London.My mum and dad are hoping to go and my we, children and her family are all going. My sister-in-law Laureen , who lives in London, has actually decided she’s going to do it as well.“I’ve started training unfortunately, it’s not great at this time of year because it’s so dark, but it’ll give me a bit of an aim – it’s only another  or  weeks away! googletag.cmd.push “With the Gaelic season just being over, the fitness isn’t too bad – Christmas wasn’t too sore on me!” If you want to support Marty in his challenge, you can read his story and donate via the following Just Giving link: https:www.justgiving fundraising martin-donaghy  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since diagnosis they have received the much needed help and support of Goldenhar UK, a charity run by families and volunteers affected by the extremely rare syndrome.Now Aodhans uncle hopes to be able to give something back by raising cash and swapping the backdrop of the Celtic Park for the Efel Tower in a fundraising drive.Marty told the County Derry Post: “It’s a very rare condition – I think  in  suffer from it and it’s visible from birth.“Obviously, neither my sister nor I had ever heard of it but she noticed that something wasn’t right. The doctors didn’t pick up on it but I suppose the condition is so rare that they hadn’t seen it before.“My sister had to push but the doctors then realised and to be fair to them they’ve been more than helpful. Some have come over from England to see Aodhan.The John Mitchels Claudy captain added: “It will affect the development of bones like his spine, but they won’t know completely until he grows up and they see more and more how it’s affecting him.“He will have to go through a few minor surgeries just to correct a few things and whenever he starts learning to stand, it’ll affect him that way, but he’s now eight months old and is developing into a happy, lively wee child.”Goldenhar Syndrome is so rare that initially Marty’s sister Catherine assumed they were alone in being affected in Northern Ireland, but since he posted his fundraising efforts online, others have been in touch.“My sister didn’t know that there was anyone  in Northern Ireland with the condition, but as soon as I put up the fundraiser, we’ve been contacted by a local lady who was able to provide my sister with a lot of information and they’re actually meeting up now.“I think there are cases in Northern Ireland but they don’t have a  or a chance to talk about it or help each other.”Marty opted for the Paris marathon despite other, closer alternatives and he is looking forward to taking on the challenge in its picturesque surroundings.“Ah, it was just more attractive. I don’t like running anyway but I just thought ‘why not ’ London is nearly impossible to get into so the Paris one was easy enough to get into and it’s probably nicer to run round than London.My mum and dad are hoping to go and my we, children and her family are all going. My sister-in-law Laureen , who lives in London, has actually decided she’s going to do it as well.“I’ve started training unfortunately, it’s not great at this time of year because it’s so dark, but it’ll give me a bit of an aim – it’s only another  or  weeks away! googletag.cmd.push “With the Gaelic season just being over, the fitness isn’t too bad – Christmas wasn’t too sore on me!” If you want to support Marty in his challenge, you can read his story and donate via the following Just Giving link: https:www.justgiving fundraising martin-donaghy  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Police informed told activists of death threats made against them.InAugust , Dalradian announced that it would no longer propose using cyanide in the gold mining process, something that had caused reat concern to local people.In November, campaigner Fidelma O’Kane was successful in the High Court after she took a judicial review against the Northern Ireland Environment Agencyover a discharge consent it had awarded to Dalradian The consent allowed the company to discharge nine heavy metals into the local Owenkillew river.In response to the objection letters, a Dalradian spokesperson told The Canary: “Dalradian’s proposal for an underground gold and silver mine in West Tyrone has received over , letters of support. This is an unprecedented number for any planning project in Northern Ireland.“Last year we made a number of environmental enhancements to our proposed processes including removing cyanide and reducing water demand by %.

After the bell had sounded, and after consulting with the ringside physician, referee Joel Scobie stopped the bout. It was a quicker than expected victory for Coyle who wanted the contest to go beyond one round.“Im always glad to have another stoppage but I wish it had gone on longer,” he admitted. “He didnt come out for round two. He had to retire on the stool after the first round. My first round was just feeling him out, and working the jab andanything follows up then just finish it, but I never got the opportunity for that. I never got the opportunity to show how well prepared I was. I came home unscathed and fresh with no injuries. I didnt even get hit once in the whole round so were ready to go again.”Dumas came into the fight with a decent reputation and even boasted twice as many knock outs as his opponent. But whilst his reputation preceded him, the reality turned out to be much dferent.“To be honest I expected him to come straight at me after the first bell went but he went onto the back foot,” Coyle continued. “My plan was to put him on the back foot and for him to come at me which would have suited me because he would have walked on to my shots. “He took me by surprise by going on the back foot. Maybe he thought I was a lot bigger than he expected or maybe, when I threw the jab, he thought he had to do something dferent. He didnt hit me so I never felt any power. Anything he did throw my footwork was too fast and he didnt land a glove. As soon as he threw, I wasnt there. I was just in and out, in and out. He couldnt hit me.” googletag.cmd.push Another stepIt may have been over much too soon for Coyles liking, but regardless, it is another step in the right direction for the -year old, who is expecting big things in . “Its just part of the game,” he stated. “Its another knock out on my record which is good for me. I put in over  rounds of sparring in the build up as well so its not to say that Im not getting the rounds. I put the hard graft in the gym so I have those rounds under my belt anyway. Ill take the TKO but I wanted to showcase everything I have been working on over the last three months.”Coyle has no objections to getting back into the ring again so soon, and having stopped his last two opponents in double quick time, he is eager to get as much in-ring experience as possible. “Thats the next step. I would like to be back quickly. I want to get the rounds in. Ive only had three rounds in nine months. In that case I would like to get a fight just for the rounds. It wasnt in the plans butwe get the go ahead well take it.“The fight in the summer is going to be a massive step because I want to break into the top ten or top five in the world.” googletag.cmd.push SponsorsConnor would like to thank the following sponsors for their continued support Classique Floor Designs, The Thirsty Goat, Frankie Ramsey’s, The Bentley Bar, Paul’s Butchers, Brooklands Fencing, Sandwich Co , RJB Tiling, Curley’s Cars and Evolve Clothing official.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street.

The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved.

The former SDLP councillor was Mr McGradyrsquos election agent.Mr Doris joined the former Downpatrick Urban District Council and was re-elected to Down Council in  and served as the districtrsquos first citizen in  .He retained his seat during several council elections and retired from the council when it formally went out of business in  when it merged with its neighbour in Newry and Mourne to become one of  new super councils.Tributes to Mr Doris have been paid by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, South Down MLA Colin McGrath, former South Down MP Baroness Margaret Ritchie and fomer council colleague Dermot Curran.Tributes have also been paid by Rowallane DUP councillor Billy Walker and UUPrsquos Robert Burgess.Mr Eastwood paid tribute to the le and legacy of Mr Doris whom he described as an ldquoSDLP stalwart and founding party member.ldquoJohn lived his le in service of others, continued the party leader.ldquoHe had a deep passion for his community of Downpatrick, which he represented with dignity for many years, as councillor and Down Council chairman.

In this very sad time, I hope they find the admiration of Johnrsquos friends and colleagues of some comfort to them.Mr McGrath said his friend and former party colleague epitomised the term ldquogentleman.The Assemblyman described Mr Doris as a ldquogentle giant of politics and someone who took him under his wing, teaching him the ropes of being a good councillor.ldquoJohn was also a successful businessman in Downpatrick but never lost his social justice roots and always did what he could to help people, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHis quiet way and manner often won out and he delivered for people on the matters that meant most to them. He was there for people in their hour of need. I offer my sympathies to Mairead and his family at this time.Cllr Curran described Mr Doris as man who had the interests of his local community very much at heart. He said his friend put the people of Downpatrick at the top of his agenda and fought valiantly for them on a range of issues, not least, social justice.ldquoJohn was proud of his roots and Downpatrick was coursing through his veins. He was my colleague and friend and he will be sadly missed by a great many people. My sympathies are very much with his we Mairead and the family circle.

In all the years we served on Down Council I never once heard him say a cross word abut anyone and he never brought sectarian politics into the chamber.ldquoHe was a councillor for the people and I was very saddened to learn of his passing. My thoughts are with his we and family. The thoughts and prayers of many people are with them at this terribly sad time, added Cllr Walker.Rowallane Ulster Unionist councillor, Robert Burgess, said he will always remember attending his first council meeting when Mr Doris introduced himself.ldquoI had nothing but the highest respect for John. He was a man of integrity and while we may have dfered politically I regarded him as a friend and a man who had the interests of Downpatrick and indeed the wider district at heart, he said.ldquoJohn was an absolute gentleman and was someome whom I held in the highest regard.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18215434.bishops-important-message-students/resources/images/10084836.jpg","title":"council agrees  year lease necarne estate","story":"However no other Councillor supported this call and the matter was discussed under confidential matters with the approval of the lease being voted through.In a social media post,Councillor OCofaigh stated that the lease had been approved by Councillors.According to a Council statement the lease will see the creation of a ldquomulti-purpose tourism and leisure destination.The Council revealed that the lease ldquoalso proposes that provision is made for the potential development of a multi-sports centre and the Council has commissioned a feasibility study into the development of such a facility.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

This included The Bottle Shop and Loursquos for Men, who each sponsored one family for the six-week duration of the scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan.

In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it.

Veteransrsquo choirs also provide opportunities in music to a whole new range of people.In another Westminster debate on fire risk in flats and shared housing, I raised the concerns of many constituents relating to building defects, fire safety issues and other matters. I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings. We should be working on this on a UK-wide basis.I also secured my own debate on incineration of industrial and commercial waste. Irsquom supporting campaigners in the east of Cardf who oppose a planned new incinerator and have concerns over emissions and the impact of HGVs near schools and homes.With an existing incinerator near Cardf Bay, and continuing controversy over the biomass plant in Barry docks in our neighbouring constituency, this is an area of concern for many people locally. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
