In 1987, she served as Commissioner of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation for the state of Maine and later as the New England regional director of the Small Business Administration in 1992.After relocating to Massachusetts to serve as the state’s Deputy State Treasurer in 1993, she returned to her native Maine in 1994 to launch a gubernatorial bid for the state’s governorship, becoming the first woman to be nominated by a major political party for the position of Governor of Maine.However, she ultimately lost the election to Angus King, who would later serve alongside her in the United States Senate.After working in the private sector, Collins again launched another political bid and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, formally taking her position as Senator the following year.          Brett Kavanaugh, above, faces an extremely close confirmation battle ahead in the U.S. SenateA moderate Republican, she was reelected in 2002, 2008 and 2014. In the Senate, Collins has played a key role on many issues and chaired the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee from 2003 to 2007.In the 2016 election, she stated that should would not support the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican standard bearer and has had a mixed record on supporting Trump after his surprise election victory, voting in favor of his proposed tax cuts in December 2017 but also opposing the President’s controversial temporary ban on travel and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries and his family separation policy at the U.S.-Mexico border.Collins has also emerged as a key swing vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, being set to unveil her final decision on October 5 ahead of the final vote in the U.S. Senate.How old is Susan Collins?Susan Collins is 65 years old.She was born on December 7, 1952.          Collins has served in the Senate since 1997 and considered a leading moderate voice thereWho is Susan Collins’s husband?Susan Collins’s husband is Thomas Daffron.The couple has been married since 2012.What is Susan Collins’s net worth?According to Open Secrets, Collins’s net worth is believed to be about $3.7 million (£2.8m).She is believed to draw her wealth from both her years of government service and through various financial investments.Susan Collins vote on KavanaughIn the lead-up to the final vote on the controversial nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Republican Senator has emerged as a critical swing vote who could ultimately decide the balance of the highest court in the United States for decades to come.Collins, who has not yet publicly decided whether she’ll vote to confirm Kavanaugh or not, has revealed that she’ll announce her decision at 3pm EST on Friday, October 5.          Senator Susan Collins will soon reveal how she intends to vote 3pm EST on Friday, October 5During a procedural vote on the morning of October 5, Collins joined other swing vote Senators like Jeff Flake and Democrat Joe Manchin in advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination to a final floor vote on October 6. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican known for bucking her party, voted against advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination.Despite voting in favor of the procedural vote to advance Kavanaugh, Collins is still undecided – at least publicly – as to whether she’ll ultimately vote to confirm him, creating much uncertainty as to whether the Supreme Court nominee has enough votes to ultimately be confirmed as the next U.S. Supreme Court Justice.The Republicans’ narrow Senate majority means that they can only afford to lose one vote if all Democrats vote against Kavanaugh and Vice President Mike Pence casts the tiebreaking vote in Kavanaugh’s favor.In addition to Collins, Senators Flake, Murkowski and Manchin have not yet publicly announced how they will vote on the planned final floor vote on Saturday, October 6.Who is Sat Hari Khalsa?

He’s currently the Workers’ Party candidate for President of Brazil in the upcoming 2018 election.Haddad was born in São Paulo, Brazil on January 25, 1963.The son of Lebanese immigrants, he earned a master’s degree in economics and a doctorate in philosophy from the University of São Paulo before starting a career as an investment analyst at Unibanco.Haddad later worked as a consultant for the Institute of Economic Research Foundation before moving into public sector work, finding employment as the chief of staff to the Finance and Economic Development Secretary for São Paulo and eventually as a special advisor at the Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management.Climbing the ranks of government steadily, he later was named as the Minister of Education for Brazil in July 2005. During his tenure, Haddad established the Basic Education Development Index to help better measure the quality of public primary and middle schools in Brazil.He also oversaw the implementation of a new scholarship program aimed at helping low-income students attend private colleges and made numerous reforms to the country’s National High School Exam.Haddad left his position in January 2012 and was named as the candidate for Mayor of São Paulo during the 2012 municipal elections in Brazil. After advancing to the second round of the election, he defeated the city’s former mayor, José Serra, with just over 55 per cent of the vote.After assuming his new duties as mayor in January 2013, he implemented a sweeping expansion of the city’s bike lane network but later sparked a major backlash in June of that year after announcing, along with the government of the state of São Paulo, that mass transit ticket prices would be increased.The decision ultimately led to mass protests in the São Paulo and many other major Brazilian cities.          Fernando Haddad served as the Mayor of São Paulo from January 2013 until January 2017By July 2016, Haddad was hobbled by a dismal approval ratings of only 14 per cent of city residents and lost his reelection bid in October 2016 to João Doria, the Brazilian Social Democracy party candidate.He ultimately left office in January 2017 after a four-year tenure as mayor of Brazil’s largest city.As the 2018 Brazil elections loomed, he was named as former President Lula da Silva’s running mate in August in his bid to regain the presidency.However, da Silva was later ruled as disqualified from running for president again by the Superior Electoral Court for violating the country’s Clean Record Act shortly afterwards on August 31 due to his conviction on corruption charges.Haddad was eventually named as da Silva’s replacement by the Workers’ Party on September 11 while Brazil Communist Party legislator Manuela d\u0027Ávila took his place as the candidate for vice president. 2018 Brazil election polls   According a recent Americas SocietyCouncil of the Americas poll, Haddad is currently in second place ahead of the election, which will be held in stages from October 7 to October 28. Haddad leads a number of other candidates but still trails Bolsonaro, the conservative populist frontrunner of the Social Liberty Party who many have compared to U.S. President Donald Trump. Bolsonaro leads the poll with 35 percent of the vote while Haddad trails with 22 percent. Notably, Haddad\u0027s polling numbers have largely flatlined in recent days while Bolsonaro has surged ahead, making his victory, while not a sure thing, all the more likely as the election gets underway.Who is Sat Hari Khalsa?

It is the community.\u0027Yet only five families in this village — population 117 — are directly associated with the school (Fletcher and Eboni, the only girl, are siblings). Milburn is an old people\u0027s village, and getting older. The Victorian building (bearing the apt sign Milburn School, Small and Friendly) was built in 1851, after a pupil set fire to the original thatched one.Then, the school was a place that met the needs of its community, with boys given time off lessons to help with sheep-shearing. In modern times, the school has had a chequered history. In 2008, it had 37 pupils, but numbers dropped to just three in 2014, following a population dip.A disastrous Ofsted assessment that year, when the school was put into special measures, busted the myth that smaller is always better (interestingly, the report highlighted that parents were starting to withdraw children because of concerns over the teaching).The end seemed to beckon. But the last Ofsted report has declared it a good school. Now the roll call has settled at five full-time pupils and one part-time nursery one — and a brand new staff.Mr Page, who previously worked in an inner-city primary in Brixton (\u0027very different,\u0027 he concedes), has been in his post since the summer. Mrs Dixon joined the school in September. She is helped by a part-time teaching assistant, Jess White, while on the reception desk is Rachel Daynes, who does the school\u0027s admin. Her role takes one day a week.At lunchtime, we adults officially outnumber the children when the cheery dinner lady Debbie (who turns out to be James\u0027s mum and a school governor) arrives, bearing food.The school dinners are made by the chef of the local pub. (\u0027He doesn\u0027t make them in the pub, it\u0027s all done at another primary school, but they taste like home-made pub food,\u0027 clarifies Mrs Dixon.) Today\u0027s lunch is homemade sausage rolls and mash, with vegetables. \u0027They are better than any school dinners I\u0027ve known before,\u0027 says Mr Page.          The children playing on the village green just outside the school just outside Penrith, CumbriaClearly, there is a very different feel to this school. It has a home-spun quality. Mrs Dixon\u0027s biggest challenge is that she teaches all the pupils in the same room (there are only two rooms the main classroom and the early years \u0027centre\u0027, which Avery pretty much gets to himself).\u0027It means you have to be on top of the entire school curriculum, whereas in my previous school I would teach a class where all the pupils were at the same stage,\u0027 Mrs Dixon says.\u0027But the advantage is because there are only five of them, they get a lot of one-on-one tuition. I know these children inside out. You just can\u0027t have that sort of knowledge with a class of 30.\u0027As classrooms go, this one is quiet, and one striking fact, immediately obvious, is that the older kids instinctively lean over to help the younger ones. Mr Page nods. \u0027Funnily enough, it\u0027s something that is formally put in place in other schools — a buddy system which links children of different ages. Here, we don\u0027t have to engineer that.\u0027Today, the children are learning about habitats and biomes, and making little models of animals. The younger children are busy with Plasticine. The older ones are creating Arctic landscapes.On the wall, the vast outside world is just a click away — via an interactive board linked to a laptop. \u0027Every child here has access to the same resources that those at bigger schools have,\u0027 says Mr Page. He\u0027s not kidding. There are virtual reality goggles for every pupil and more laptops in this school than there are children.There is no assembly hall — \u0027although it\u0027s important that we have assembly, so once a week we do it, in the corner there,\u0027 says Mr Page.There is also no traditional sports day because, to put it bluntly, there aren\u0027t enough legs for a fair race. \u0027Instead we have a community sports day, where we invite the village.\u0027Our conversations keep coming back to the community. Without it, it\u0027s clear this school would have died. \u0027We need their support,\u0027 says Mr Page. \u0027In schools I\u0027ve worked in previously, a sponsored walk might have raised £3,000. Here, there is no hope of that, but the local people have been tremendous.\u0027We put on lunches where they come and the children serve them. Everyone says that they love to see the children playing outside.\u0027The mood is more relaxed than in most schools. There are specific breaktimes and lunchtimes, but there is no electric bell (at the end of the day the children take turns to pull the chain on the big manual one themselves), so things don\u0027t feel as regimented. \u0027And we can take a bit longer at break one day, if we like,\u0027 says Mrs Dixon. \u0027Or vice versa. If the kids are busy doing something, we can have break late. Sometimes they are engrossed, and they want to keep going.\u0027In a school this size, school trips can be more ad hoc. \u0027We took them all to the Westmorland Show the other day,\u0027 says Mrs Dixon. \u0027If we want to go sailing, we can.\u0027There is an outdoors classroom in the woods nearby and, if it\u0027s a nice day, they can pick up their books and go there. \u0027We will sometimes come outside and read a book under the tree, too,\u0027 she says.Don\u0027t get the impression that anything goes here, though. A lot is expected of these children. They are polite and respectful, but any high jinks (yes, we are looking at you, Oliver) are quickly dealt with.\u0027You have to be careful with that,\u0027 concedes Mr Page. \u0027A teacher here will see all the little things, and the temptation is to come down too hard. You don\u0027t want that either.\u0027To watch them line up at Mrs Dixon\u0027s command seems a little excessive (given there are only five of them, is it worth it?), but it\u0027s a fundamental. \u0027They have to line up, because it instils discipline, and they will have to do it at their next school,\u0027 says Mr Page.Mr Page\u0027s other school is nearby Beaconside Primary School, which has 451 pupils. Once a week the pupils travel to Beaconside in a minibus, where they take part in lessons that would be difficult to arrange at Milburn.They do music, PE and French. Mixing with larger peer groups here is beneficial, \u0027but they like to come back here, too,\u0027 says Mr Page. It sounds like having the best of both worlds. In fact, if Milburn seems to be the perfect primary school, then it is precisely because it has achieved the impossible. It\u0027s like a high-tech version of the school out of Little House On The Prairie.It\u0027s also a one-off. The Church of England, which oversees 70 per cent of schools with fewer than 110 pupils, warned earlier this year that it may have to close many of them because of problems with funding, teacher supply and maintenance.So far, Milburn is not on any hit list, but its future will depend on boosting those pupil numbers, particularly since the eldest will be moving on soon. There is some (half) joking today about the school needing a family with five children to move into the village.\u0027Seriously, though, we have been giving a lot of thought to what the ideal size would be,\u0027 says Mr Page. \u0027A school like Milburn couldn\u0027t get too big without you losing the thing that makes it special. My view is that if we had two pupils in each year group, it would be perfect.\u0027It would, if for no other reason than in the three-legged race at that annual community sports day, each child would have a partner.And 14 children would give you Mary, Joseph et al, and a whole flock of sweet little shepherds.*One child\u0027s name has been changed, at the parents\u0027 request.   "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/09/4C0B70AC00000578-0-image-m-18_1525941760972.jpg","title":"Barbara Windsor 81 opens dementia time","story":"    The former Carry On star appeared calling for people to take a stand against dementia alongside her husband, Scott Mitchell (pictured) She says taking part will \u0027support ground-breaking research to find a cure for a condition that affects so many people, like me.

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

She talks about the environment, victim-blaming – and being a hillbillyVisiting Barbara Kingsolver on her farm in Appalachia feels like entering some form of enchanted bower. As we drive through the nearby town of Abingdon, Virginia, she identifies some brightly painted wooden houses the tavern built in 1779 the Barter theatre that’s been running since the great depression, when actors performed in exchange for food, trading “ham for Hamlet”. Then there’s her big, cosy farmhouse with its heavy wooden beams, Bartók and Satie sheet music on the piano (she went to college on a music scholarship and has played in various bands), and her border collie Hugo following her around as she quizzes me in unusual detail on how I like my coffee. “I’m southern,” she jokes. “I want to make you happy.” If all this sounds a little too idyllic, there’s nothing sugary about Kingsolver herself. Warm but brisk, she seems to have arranged this as a safe place from which to examine the many more alarming things outside it. Her new book, Unsheltered, a return to the more ambitious, grand scale of novels such as The Lacuna and The Poisonwood Bible (which she’s currently adapting for the screen), though lively and vividly peopled, is a novel of ideas, and bleak ones at that. It addresses a world coming apart at the seams. Willa Knox, laid off from her magazine job and trying to keep her family afloat, despite a series of disasters – a bereavement, crushing college debt and healthcare costs, vanishing investments – lives in Vineland, New Jersey, a former utopian community, in an old house that’s crumbling around her.While attempting to keep the roof from caving in, she becomes interested in the people who lived in the same neighbourhood in the 1870s they form the novel’s second strand. Thatcher Greenwood, a science teacher whose excitement about Darwin’s ideas puts him at risk of unemployment and who is newly and rather precariously married to the socially ambitious Rose, lives in the same building as Willa, with shoddy foundations above which “the whole house is at odds with itself”. Greenwood befriends the historical figure Mary Treat, a correspondent of Charles Darwin and Asa Gray, who spends her time on scientific experiments, keeping spiders in jars and letting carnivorous plants gnaw for hours at her fingers (Kingsolver showed me some of these plants in her own garden).She decided it would be “useful to go back to some other moment in history when people felt a similar absolute disorientation in the universe”. She’d considered writing about Darwin himself, before deciding “I write American novels”, no matter how far afield they roam. “Such a sweet man!” she says. “Thank God there was no internet. People hated him so much. Emily Dickinson hated him, for God’s sakes! She didn’t hate anybody.” It’s “hard to understand now how threatening it was”, she says of Darwin’s ideas, for human beings to be told that in fact they weren’t “put here to be in charge of the rest of the world”. Her hope in Unsheltered was to explore “paradigm shift”. “What do people do when it feels like they’re living through the end of the world as we know it? Because that’s what it seems like we’re doing right now, and almost nobody disagrees. And maybe people said that 10 years ago, but now they’re really saying ‘WTF?’”Like those in 1871, the characters in 2016 are struggling to come to terms with the realisation that all their assumptions and expectations in life, including their basic understanding of both natural and economic laws, no longer apply. The beliefs that “ice would stay frozen and there would always be more fish in the sea”, that growth and consumption could and should go on for ever, that hard work would pay off and that each generation would have more than the last, have been swept away. Whether now or at the fall of the Roman empire, Kingsolver says: “At the end of an era, people keep grabbing harder on to the world that they know.” See what happens, as she puts it, “when you put a bunch of rats in a box.” And of course when their material shelter is under threat, people tend to seek the safety of familiar ideas. She is not surprised that “we either choose or allow men to lead us who formed their notion of what is good and how to solve problems half a century ago, in the 1950s and 60s. Look at any picture of who’s running this country. They’re all old men in suits.”Every economic catastrophe that befalls the fictional family, Kingsolver says, is something that has happened to someone she knows. Now “the end times have reached the inner circle” she believes it will “strip away a layer of denial” about how society actually functions. In the US until recently, “enough people have been comfortable enough to support the myth that we deserve what we have”, allowing for that “awfully American disease” of victim-blaming.Clear throughout Unsheltered is a tension between self-reliance and interdependence. “That’s the dialectic,” she says, “the fundamental conflict that I think is at the heart of every single thing I write. That push-pull, that tug between the desire for inidual expression, being a person who can take care of herself, and the necessity of relying on a community, all of the bonds that we don’t notice or don’t acknowledge.” It’s a theme that has preoccupied her ever since her ecology and evolutionary biology PhD on the genetics of altruism, which she abandoned after a “crisis of faith”, when, “lying in bed, counting in my mind the people on Earth who would read it, I came up with 11.” It’s not only an intellectual interest: “I saw a lot of unhappiness in the people who gave their lives over to service, a lot of frustration, a lot of misery, really. The women of my mother’s generation were a very unhappy lot. That’s why so many of them ended up taking Valium, I guess! And I didn’t want that.”Yet Kingsolver doesn’t seem the type to lose herself easily. She wrote her first novel, The Bean Trees, by night while pregnant with her elder daughter, Camille, working as a journalist during the day. She notes that her fierce insomnia was in some ways helpful: “Everyone has the same number of hours in a day – except me.” When Camille was late and the doctor recommended inducing the birth, Kingsolver refused an induction and used the extra time to get the book finished. Later, Camille and Lily, her daughter from her second marriage, knew never to disturb her when she was working. “There are two reasons you can knock on this door,” she remembers telling them. “Arterial bleeding the house is on fire.” Joking aside, “they respected that. They knew that Mama was doing something important in there.” She had planned never to marry or depend on a man, feeling that “I’m not going to be that person who, you know, makes the meal and gets no credit. I think that’s in my psyche, the desire to self-define and also the thorough understanding that nobody really does self-define, no one is self-made. The bottom truth is that nothing functions in isolation.”At this point Kingsolver’s husband, Steven Hopp arrives to bring us lunch from his farm-to-table restaurant in Abingdon. He teaches environmental studies at Emory \u0026amp Henry College nearby. When she notices a dead bird that seems to have crashed into a window, he identifies it immediately as a yellow rumped warbler. They met in 1993 when she came over from Tucson, Arizona, for a two-week visiting writer gig. By then a single mother living “in pretty dire straits”, she spoke to his global wildlife conservation class and “did such a good job that he just had to marry me, I guess”. Despite her misgivings about marrying at all, let alone for a second time, they kept in touch and began living together once “our phone bills surpassed our mortgages”, eventually settling on the farm in Virginia. Kingsolver, who grew up in Kentucky, is treated as a local in Abingdon – several generations of her family had lived in the area, including a great-great-uncle who delivered the babies there for decades. “I’m a hillbilly. We look all kinds of different ways and this is one of them,” she says, complaining that she can hardly watch late night political comedy for the ignorant jokes at her neighbours’ expense. Even “well-meaning friends” have a skewed perception of the place where she lives. She understands why people in the middle of the country “feel the contempt of the people who are in charge of urban, progressive culture. That’s real. It’s pretty relentless and it’s gotten worse.” That’s one more reason she was intrigued by the 19th century, a time when “we had just been through this civil rupture where the country broke in half and it was as polarised as it is now, along somewhat similar geographic lines, which was instructive to think about.. Mainly rural versus urban, agrarian versus industrial, a rupture that has never healed.”Kingsolver likes nothing better than to take a difficult, “uncomfortable” subject – what the US did to the Congo, say – and spin it into the most appealing package she can find, so that readers and book clubs all over the world can enjoy wandering among her thorny questions. “I’m in a really unusual position,” she says, “because I work as a literary writer. I work at the level of the sentence, at the level of the image, the metaphor, the theme, but I also have this commitment to accessibility, which I suppose comes from the fact I grew up here. It’s the same reason I sent my kids to public schools: I want to belong to people. I don’t want to be above them. So I would really like anyone who can read to be able to read my novels and I would like to give them a reason to turn every page.” Journalists are often surprised that her books have such large ambitions. They ask questions that amount to: “Are you allowed to do this?” She notes: “Men don’t get asked that.” Nonetheless, she has an answer – she never studied writing. “I didn’t get an MFA in the 1980s and 90s, when everything was minimalism, saying that conflict has to be at the level of the marriage, or at most the grocery store. I didn’t know that’s what I was supposed to do, and therefore didn’t do it.”It’s not only an aesthetic issue, though. “This country has been phobic for a long time about art that engages with real questions, matters of genuine social or environmental concern. I can write about my alcoholic father but not the economic forces that made him an alcoholic.” The Lacuna, set in the Mexico City of Diego Rivera and the US during the McCarthy period, was her “attempt to answer that question of what happened in this country to make people so wary of art with meaning. It’s so hard to see the fishbowl you’re living in.” Her launch of the Bellwether prize for socially engaged fiction, which has for two decades been awarding the amount of Kingsolver’s first advance to a new writer every other year, was another response. She notes that things have now begun to change, both in fiction and outside it. For instance, in the US, “a surprising number of people under 30 identify as socialists, or at least don’t identify as capitalists. They see that infinite growth is science fiction. They don’t really think we can just jump over to Mars and keep building cities.” That said, she speaks of “how discouraging it has been to raise daughters who ran up against the exact same crap that I did in terms of sexual harassment, and every kind of sexism.” Even the number of young women who still take their husbands’ names disturbs her – she can’t understand why it’s still so popular to “erase yourself”. To the extent that Kingsolver is an optimist, it’s because she sees that as the only practical and conscionable option. When she tells me of her visit to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef earlier this year, a treat after turning in the Unsheltered manuscript, she’s quick to correct me about the direness of the reef’s fate. “Reports of its death are greatly exaggerated,” she says, and gives me a very swift, clear account of why these particular corals with their particular microclimates can still survive, heal and adapt.“You’re hearing about everything that dies, you’re not hearing about everything that’s still alive,” she says. “If you think it’s dead already then you’re not going to be bothered.

Just over £1bn of that income came from firms they also audited.The FRC’s proposals echo calls by a parliamentary committee earlier this year, which demanded that the audit arms of accountancy firms should be detached from their consulting services, to avoid conflicts of interest.The FRC is itself under intense pressure to improve its performance, after being widely criticised as too timid and too close to the firms it is supervising. It is currently the subject of a government review, led by Sir John Kingman, to determine if it is fit for the future.The FRC said that it would in future “conclude cases more quickly” and increase fines so that financial penalties against auditors “reflect the gravity of the issue”.In June, PwC was hit with a record £6.5m fine over failings on its audit of retailer BHS two years before its collapse, but the FRC report indicates that future fines could be much higher.The sector is also braced for a breakup of the dominance of the big four, with calls for the Competition and Market Authority to reopen an investigation.In a statement referring to the FRC’s criticisms, Michelle Hinchliffe, head of audit at KPMG, said: “We are taking action to address these results. We are investing heavily in our audit business to ensure the highest standards of consistency and rigour are applied across all aspects of our work.”﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd2147c5bd8beef8f37374e3c214b15cbfcbbe51/0_1_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4152325abbf8e6eaab451e9b2f07a05c","title":"french connection for sale stephen marks mike ashley","story":"Founder Stephen Marks could sell stake, with Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct a possible bidderStephen Marks, the chairman and chief executive, is looking to offload his holding, nearly half a century after creating the fashion brand. French Connection said in a statement it was “reviewing all strategic options in order to deliver maximum value for its shareholders, which includes the potential sale of the company”.Marks, who founded French Connection in 1972 and named it after the film starring Gene Hackman, has come under mounting pressure from investors to relinquish control of the business after years of losses. His dual role has been heavily criticised and the company responded by appointing two new independent directors last year.French Connection shot to prominence with its notorious FCUK T-shirt slogan in the 1990s. The eyebrow-raising logo was brought back in 2016 but failed to revive the fashion brand. The firm has struggled to keep up with rivals such as Asos, Next and Zara.The company, which also owns the brands Great Plains and YMC and recently sold Toast, last month reported a big increase in half-year losses and further store closures. It blamed tough conditions on the high street and provisions for bad debts partly related to the collapse of House of Fraser, in whose stores French Connection has concessions.Faced with the decline of the British high street, French Connection has been shifting its business towards wholesale and started closing shops five years ago. It aims to have only 30 in the UK and Europe by the end of January 2019, less than half the total it had in 2013. The firm supplies department stores in the US such as Bloomingdales and Nordstrom, as well as the online arms of UK and European retailers.Russ Mould, the investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “A potential buyer would have to have to look at the company’s leases and create a plan to streamline the estate of physical stores. It could seek to do more licensing deals as this is proving to be a resilient part of the business, so why not focus more attention here to accelerate growth? And there could be opportunities to make the wholesale business even larger.“There could even be an opportunity to capitalise on French Connection’s brand awareness and revitalise the brand strength which it previously enjoyed in the 1990s.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5b2dd42773aba5887744a56959356be370d39ef/0_166_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69afcdf073b5cc8d4da56db2df500324","title":"repulsive to children and adults how explicit should public art get","story":"Censorship in metro stations and other public places reveal limits to how far we’re prepared to be challenged by artThe Vienna tourist board had long earmarked 2018 for its year-long retrospective of Viennese modernism. Unexpectedly, of all the artworks it could have advertised it with – Gustav Klimt’s tender Kiss Venus in the Grotto by Koloman Moser – it chose a selection of characteristically baleful, spindly nudes by Egon Schiele.“We thought it was so stark, so strong to work with in advertising,” says spokeswoman Helena Hartlauer one drizzly afternoon at Café Museum, a traditional coffeehouse in Vienna where Schiele, Klimt and their peers were regulars more than 100 years ago. “And then we were made to cover most of it up.”Advertising regulators in Germany, the UK and US all refused to display the figures – male and female – uncensored. A source close to the decision-making of Transport for London expressed concern that the depiction of genitals, though artistic, could be at odds with public wellbeing.The decisions demonstrated not only Schiele’s continued capacity to shock, 108 years after his nudes were removed from an exhibition for their “obscene nature”, but also the unseen ceiling on artistic expression in shared spaces.Public art is usually spoken of approvingly, as is art that pushes boundaries. But is there a limit to how challenged we’re prepared to be in places like airports and train stations, where everyone has to go?After two weeks of back-and-forth about how much Schiele’s nudes needed to be covered, the Viennese tourist board had the idea to reframe the rejection as an opportunity. It resubmitted the posters with an apology splashed across Schiele’s bare bodies: “SORRY, 100 years old but still too daring today.” The accompanying hashtag, #ToArtItsFreedom, referenced the slogan of the Viennese secession: “To every age its art, to art its freedom.”“We figured it’s the exact same discussion” as 100 years ago, says Hartlauer. “It’s art, it’s not pornographic. But apparently some people are still offended.” Of course in this case Schiele’s art was also advertising, and therefore in London was held to the same standards as any other material displayed on TfL’s network. With 31 million trips recorded every day, TfL says it must be considerate of its large and erse audience.From its recent censorship of both a woman’s bare back and an irreverent funeral campaign, TfL seems to err on the side of caution. (German authorities agreed to display Schiele’s female nude with torso uncovered TfL didn’t.) Surely a distinction can be made between a masterpiece in oil on canvas and Gary Lineker with his kit off?A spokeswoman referred  Cities to TfL’s advertising policy, which says that though it does not seek to be a censor, its network is largely closed: “unlike TV, online and print media, people cannot simply switch off or turn a page if an advertisement offends or upsets them”.This is a crucial distinction with other public expressions of artistic nudity: as functional, shared spaces, transport hubs have to try to accommodate everyone.In Stockholm, where the metro doubles as the world’s longest art gallery, with works by 150 artists displayed in 90 of the 110 stations, the line can be harder to draw. Last year The Night Garden, a series of 26 enlarged felt-pen sketches – of birds, cats, trees and even naked men – by the graphic artist Liv Strömquist, known for her feminist and satirical perspective, was accepted for exhibition at Slussen station. Three of the 26 images captured particular attention: those showing women with visible menstrual blood. One, of an ice skater in repose with a red stain on her leotard, was captioned “It’s Alright (I’m Only Bleeding)”.Images of it went viral, further cementing the city’s progressive reputation. Strömquist says an American tourist told her they’d made a special trip to Slussen station just to see it. “This would never happen in the US,” they told her. She says: “They think it’s typical for Sweden because there has been so much feminist progress.”In truth, the cartoons were polarising even in Stockholm. Feedback to the transport company Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL) ranged from “the best you’ve ever done” and “it makes me happy each time” to “vulgar, dirty and provocative” and “repulsive to both children and adults”.“People felt that this is a sign that our society is going in the right direction, and a sign that everything is falling apart,” says Strömquist, laughing.Nearly all of the 30-odd responses formally logged by SL were critical of the menstruating characters. Most were from men, and many expressed concern about the potential toll on children and Sweden’s international reputation. The menstruating ice skater was defaced in one station with black paint, as was cartoonist Kolbeinn Karlsson’s “bathhouse diary” series of homoerotic male nudes at Fridhemsplan station.The far-right populist Sweden Democrats (who saw an increase in support in the recent election) even politicised her work in a meme, juxtaposing one of her images with an oil painting of boats: their preferred interpretation of public art.Strömquist admits she was surprised when SL accepted The Night Garden, and praises it for having “the guts to put it up”. “You very rarely see menstrual blood out in a public space,” she says. “I was expecting them to say ‘This is too provocative,’ but they didn’t.”Martina Viklund, a spokeswoman for SL, says the metro’s artworks are decided by a panel with few guiding criteria beyond meeting a certain professional standard.“Art is art,” she says. “It’s an expression, a way of thinking – it would be wrong to limit artists and not give them this chance.” She believes the criticism of Strömquist’s cartoon reflects a taboo over a natural part of life, and demonstrates the need for more provocative public art – “so we can start the discussion”.To that, some might ask whether their commute is the time or the place. Many complainants said Strömquist’s cartoons would suit a museum – or “places where people actually want to look at it”, to quote one – but not the metro, where more than 1 million trips are recorded each day.Yet Stockholm metro bills itself as “one gigantic art gallery”: did Strömquist and Karlsson push that function of the space too far?Back in Vienna, Hartlaeur says the tourist board’s campaign was more successful precisely because of TfL’s cover-up. She says it sparked a global debate about artistic censorship, double standards for advertising, the appropriateness of the human body and the need for shared spaces to be inclusive of all.When the board extended the campaign to New York, it was censored on the subway the politan Transportation Authority has form for rejecting ads depicting “sexual or excretory activities”.But the city made one notable exception.A full-frontal female nude (risqué even for Schiele, and not used elsewhere in the advertising campaign) was shown uncensored, several metres high, on the side of a building – simply because it was a handpainted mural.The double standard baffles Hartlauer. “In the subway, it was the same restrictions that had applied in Europe, but with the mural it was suddenly possible.” She adds, with some satisfaction: “And we’d chosen the most explicit one.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cd316e70be76165c84ae8eb45142c28d8d874e0/0_0_4896_3264/master/4896.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8ec2bef739d9b91cd2950fbc5a45bfda 960w","title":"brexit dads army dont panic","story":"Sentimental versions of our island story are a handicap when it comes to deciding Britain’s futureSometimes history is made by surprise. As with the fall of the Berlin Wall, it’s only afterwards that how the event came about becomes clear. Sometimes it’s blindingly obvious what’s coming, but you can’t see how to stop it.No one, today, can miss the inexorable unfolding across the headlines and social media timelines of a transformed relationship between Britain and Europe. It is poignant that another turning point of history, the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war, will be marked just as the Brexit talks lurch into a future that could threaten not just our prosperity but also the survival of the organisation that has been guarantor of Europe’s peace for half a century.Tories spent last week boldly whistling their unique brand of the kind of historical revisionism that has played a major part in getting us here. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general who has given up the huge extra-parliamentary income he earned as a barrister from defending wealthy rogues, decided to tickle Tory loyalists in his warm-up for Theresa May’s closing conference speech on Wednesday with a burst of poetry from the English civil war poet, John Milton. Cox’s thing is defending flimsy cases, and as he strode round the platform declaiming sonorously, like Rumpole on a particularly outrageous brief, it was easy to see why they pay him so well.His audience was desperate for someone to explain where the bonkers Brexit express was headed, and then persuade them it would be nice when they got there. Cox found the necessary uplift in the Areopagitica, Milton’s rampage against censorship.“Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant Nation rousing herself like a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible locks: Methinks I see her as an Eagle mewing her mighty youth, and kindling her undazl’d eyes at the full midday beam.”At least the civil war is a classier reference point than the second world war or Churchill, which tend to be the go-to framing for any conversation about British history. Yet in further depressing evidence of the grip that a sentimentalised past continues to have on our collective imagination, plans were announced last week to remake the three lost episodes of Dad’s Army. It turns out that it doesn’t matter how flimsy the product, the triumph of the bumbling amateur against the odds is unbeatable. Even the 2016 film, dismissed by the ’s critic as “Brit-comedy ancestor worship”, took £8.7m at the box office. Repeats of the TV series – a series that ran, remember, from 1968 to 1977 – still top the BBC Two ratings.When Dad’s Army launched, Paul Fox, then the controller of BBC One, was worried that it might offend veterans or those who’d lost loved ones in a war that had ended less than 25 years earlier. In the event, he found that its soft-focus portrait of defiant Britain muddling along was just how people wanted to remember it. It was reassuring in the turbulent and uncertain 1960s to be reminded that pomposity, hierarchy and incompetence had somehow produced victory, and it played into the idea that it was the Dunkirk spirit and British genius rather than the mighty US war machine that had won the war.The series’ gently faded humour more or less survives. More troublingly, given our current predicament, so does its celebration of a false sense of British exceptionalism. It perpetuates a lie that significantly distorts the national narrative.As Rob Hutton’s new account of the secret war against British fascists, Agent Jack, shows, there were ordinary people who were not at all determined to resist Hitler. Yet the Dad’s Army narrative, just like the idea of a return to the Elizabethan era popular among Brexiters, reinforces the myth that Britain prospers best when she stands alone.Worse, it reinforces the dangerous chasm in outlook between generations. To most people under 50, the Dad’s Army school of all-white, all-male British history just looks weird. Baby boomers learned to read from comics where goggle-wearing aviators shouted, “Bandits at nine o’clock!”, before thrusting their Spitfires into a death-defying e. The memory of violence and the sense of national jeopardy in the recent past was vividly alive in parents and grandparents.But millennials, the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of peace and prosperity, don’t think like that at all. They, or at least many of their friends, have multiple identities and ideas of home, and violence is associated more with the random acts of terror than any external military jeopardy.Yet Milton’s puissant nation is perhaps a better model for our times than Cox realised, and certainly more useful than most of the morals to be drawn from Dad’s Army tales. As a smart piece of instant academic commentary explains, the author was not a proto-jingoist, he wanted ersity and freedom in order to honour truth. If some of that spirit can be channelled into the final phase of Brexit negotiations, we might not all be, as Private Frazer would put it, “doomed”.• Anne Perkins is a former deputy political editor of the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61908e8018c6671645ec3e022b35bcdc80b987f1/0_100_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=057dc8e5364dc20379bfef2eb2434c89","title":"kavanaugh case revealed system rigged against women","story":"There are no silver linings to the judge’s confirmation. But the history of women’s activism shows the virtue of persistence“The arc of the moral universe is long,” said Martin Luther King Jr, “but it bends towards justice.” It is hard to keep faith with that right now. A woman with everything to lose took on the might of the US political establishment, only to see the man she accused of sexually assaulting her appointed to the highest court in the land, following a hasty smokescreen of an investigation.Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the supreme court on Saturday was not just a defeat for sexual assault victims, it was also a clear reaffirmation of an entrenched, patriarchal hierarchy. It was a reminder to all women that there was more important business to be done there were ideological agendas that needed to be advanced and political careers that needed to be protected. The perfunctory way the Republicans endorsed a shoddy FBI probe, the result of which was a foregone conclusion, sent a clear message that many women are familiar with: this is bigger than you.And yet it still felt like the worst might not happen. Maybe it was because #MeToo gave rise to the false hope that fundamental change was truly possible. Perhaps it was because the moral contrast between Dr Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh was so huge it was almost comical: Ford composed, human and brittle Kavanaugh snarling, rude and unravelling. This was the bad guy, the images screamed, and he wasn’t even trying to hide it. But with every new revelation, with every apparent lie Kavanaugh told during his testimony, there was always an underlying sense of futility. Everyone was just going through the motions. It was excruciatingly tense and yet deep down we already knew the outcome. Like watching a bullet travel in slow motion towards its target.So who today wants to hear nonsense about long arcs bending towards justice? Can anyone find comfort in empty aphorisms about how we shall prevail? This surely is a time to look defeat right in the eye and make peace with it. To allow anger and try to figure out what to do with it. To acknowledge that women marched and said, “Me too”, and were told: “So what?” And it is true that there appear to be no silver linings. In fact, there is only the possibility of more setbacks, as the balance of the supreme court shifts to the right, and the nightmare of Roe v Wade being overturned, leading to a rollback of abortion rights, becomes reality. A man accused of sexual assault and of exposing himself to another woman will preside over the reproductive rights of women until the end of his natural life, if he so chooses.The US (along with the rest of the west) likes to believe itself a virtuous defender of women’s rights. There is no doubt that a woman’s lot on the whole is likely to be better if she is born in the United States as opposed to, say, Afghanistan. But the relative advances made mask the many ways in which women are second-class citizens. The Ford-Kavanaugh affair spelled them all out in plain view: a culture of violence towards women in schools and universities the cultural disdain towards women’s pain, evidenced in the public mockery of Ford’s experience by President Trump and the grotesque laughing faces lined up behind him at a Mississippi rally the obdurate patriarchy underpinning the state and mobilising its machinery to ensure that Kavanaugh was shepherded to confirmation.This dirty business was all conducted in language and ritual designed to vaunt the liberal greatness of the US, even while liberal values were undermined. We saw the self-conscious show of “respect for due process”, the charade of “moderate” Republicans in solemn deliberation, and the pantomime of supposed bipartisanship. Those at the sharp end of US foreign policy are familiar with this con, which advances cynical interests and atrocities abroad, but always with a supposedly heavy heart as it accepts the burden of living up to its values. The con has now been perpetrated on American women, told in tortured rhetoric by their representatives that a difficult moral decision has been made in the best interests of the nation. The language of aspiration, of hope in a better future, has been hijacked.But the temptation to despair must be resisted. There will be other moments of reckoning. Martin Luther King’s arc is more like a zig-zag a freehand scribble that loops, rising and falling, sometimes towards justice and at other times away from it. It is a frontline in the battle for justice that advances and retreats. Thinking of progress as some inexorable, linear thing, where achievements can be ticked off as settled for good, creates a false sense of comfort. It breeds the kind of complacency that ushered in a Trump victory, which has now installed a judge whose influence is likely to outlast Trump’s administration by decades.When the system is so rigged against women, so hardwired against the promotion of their basic rights, the fight for justice is not fought in landmark battles. It is fought street by street, in messy skirmishes of unpredictable outcome. There is no guarantee that the Kavanaugh episode will unleash an anger that will finally turn the tide and fulfil the promise of the #MeToo movement. Right now, it looks like Ford’s efforts were for nothing, and the collective emotional investment of women from all over the world paid out no idend in justice. But fighting for a cause is about the mundane hollowness of repetition.Sometimes there will be a breakthrough, sometimes we will be pushed back. This is the arc of women’s activism throughout history, and it bends towards persistence. Victory is not certain, but defeat is – if we despair. We just have to show up and keep showing up. There is no other choice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee00d47df8fa54426f79f9084fb02df82037b904/0_43_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e547203852466dab7aac55bf7b919aa","title":"world leaders climate change ipcc report","story":"The dangers if governments ignore efforts to limit warming to 1.5C are more grave than the summary makes outA report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms the enormous wisdom that governments showed in Paris in December 2015, when they agreed to the goal of “pursuing efforts” to limit global warming to 1.5C.The report’s summary for policymakers paints a sobering picture of the potentially terrible impacts of allowing global mean surface temperature to rise by 2C compared with pre-industrial levels: more extreme weather, sea level rise and ocean acidification, with detrimental effects on wildlife, crops, water availability and human health.But the policymakers, or at least their aides, should make the effort to read the whole report. Incredibly, the stark summary is still a relatively conservative assessment of the consequences we might face if global warming does exceed 1.5C.The report is a comprehensive review of the published evidence painstakingly compiled by hundreds of authors and reviewers over the past two and a half years. The summary of the report was approved line by line by governments, including the US, Australia and Saudi Arabia, during long and intensive discussions last week in South Korea.It is written in matter-of-fact language, but it omits some of the biggest risks of climate change, which are described in the full text.For instance, the summary indicates that warming of 2C would have very damaging impacts on many parts of the world. But it does not mention the potential for human populations to migrate and be displaced as a result, leading to the possibility of war.This is a risk that many governments around the world have already recognised, with climate change often highlighted in national security assessments as a “threat multiplier”, which could increase the chances of political instability and conflict.The summary also leaves out important information about so-called “tipping points” in the climate system, beyond which impacts become unstoppable, irreversible or accelerate. It acknowledges that the land-based ice sheets in Greenland and west Antarctica may be destabilised even by warming of 1.5C, ensuring several metres of sea level rise over the coming centuries. But there is no mention of other important thresholds that might, for instance, halt the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic, or cause shifts in the occurrence of the monsoons in Africa and Asia.It is not clear why such crucial information has been left out of the summary. Perhaps the authors felt that there are too many uncertainties in our knowledge to be definitive. But the danger is that policymakers will assume the absence of these very significant risks from the summary means that researchers have assessed them to be unimportant or impossible.Uncertainties are also evident in the summary assessment of the economics of climate change and the cost of doing something about it. It indicates that, to keep to the 1.5C target, carbon prices would need to be three to four times higher than for 2C. But on the overall investment required, it states: “The literature on total mitigation costs of 1.5C mitigation pathways is limited and was not assessed in this report”.These omissions in the IPCC summary are puzzling. But nevertheless the overwhelming conclusion any reasonable policymakers will reach from reading the summary is that the target of keeping global warming to 1.5C is both affordable and absolutely necessary in order to avoid highly dangerous consequences.The question now is whether world leaders such as Donald Trump and Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, will ignore the IPCC report and continue their policy of inaction on climate change, including a disregard of the Paris agreement, when the impacts so clearly threaten the lives and livelihoods of people in their countries and around the world.• Bob Ward is policy and communications director at the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd8d2b0e0a1533c70ec2c3f9b64004c5c594fd5/180_239_3689_2214/master/3689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2975c1d62886e2375cd8800859e22d69","title":"tesco to scrap best before dates from fruit and vegetable lines","story":"Labels will be ditched from a further 116 lines of produce to help reduce food wasteThe UK’s largest supermarket is to scrap potentially confusing “best before” dates from dozens more of its fresh fruit and vegetable lines after research found ditching the labels helped customers reduce their food waste at home.Tesco shoppers will from this week no longer find date labels on a further 116 items of produce – including own-brand apples, oranges, cabbages and asparagus. Tesco hopes this will prevent food from being thrown away while still edible. The supermarket removed guidance dates from about 70 fruit and vegetable lines earlier this year.Compulsory “use by” labels have to be put on foods such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy products that carry a safety risk if eaten after that date. But the best before dates put on fruit and vegetables are largely a quality indication to show that although they may no longer be at their best, they are still safe to eat.Food waste is a huge issue in the UK: £13bn of edible food is thrown away from homes every year, according to the government’s waste advisory body, Wrap. A further £3bn is wasted by the hospitality and food service sector.“Removing best before dates is our way of making it easier for customers to reduce food waste at home and save money in the process” said Mark Little, Tesco’s head of food waste reduction. “It’s simply not right that food goes to waste and we’re going to do everything we can to help.”Last month Tesco was among major supermarkets and manufacturers signing up to efforts to drive down the food waste mountain by committing to halving waste from “farm to fork” by 2030.A roadmap published by Wrap and the food and grocery charity IGD sets a series of milestones for businesses to reduce waste at every stage of the supply chain. Now 27 of Tesco’s biggest suppliers have published their food waste data for the first time.Tesco also works in partnership with suppliers to find ways to use as much of their crop as possible, including relaxing specifications to allow “wonky” or imperfect fruit and vegetables to go on sale, or creating new products while food is still edible, for example ensuring avocados that are close to becoming overripe are taken to a UK supplier and used to create guacamole."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/697b857d42790bf950c42c1a3a8bfbda4cecb1a1/0_4_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ed868ba49f12b583d1c1d8c265c6d9f","title":"patterns in nature 2018 rsb photographer of the year shortlist in pictures","story":"The Royal Society of Biology’s 12 shortlisted entries range from symmetries seen under a microscope to camouflaged insects• The winners of the Photographer, and Young Photographer of the Year competitions will be announced on 11 October in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26da604fc04d9ff921513636a43177c8873496a2/0_192_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a2fb1085e5f75862b99c38219d5007d","title":"ipcc climate change report urgent action fossil fuels live","story":"UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says coal-fired electricity must end by 2050 if we are to limit global warming rises to 1.5C That is it from the liveblog. For all the news and reaction to the IPCC report please follow our coverage here. Julie Hirigoyen, chief executive at UK Green Building Council (UKGBC), said:This report from the IPCC is a wake-up call for governments and businesses across the globe. One of the goals of the international 2015 COP21 climate deal was to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. This latest IPCC report points to the urgency and scale of action required to achieve this, which should be keenly reviewed by every single boardroom. There is no doubt that business leaders need to make bold decisions today to transition to a lowno-carbon economy that can sustain future generations.According to my colleague Jon Watts, the big question now is whether governments will act on the report or ignore it:In Britain, the next step will be a meeting in parliament to discuss how to move towards net zero emissions. It will be chaired by Lord Krebs, former member of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), and speakers will include Prof Jim Skea, who was co-chair of an IPCC working group, and Baroness Brown. The government to expected to formally ask the CCC for advice around 15 October.Gebru Jember Endalew, the chair of the Least Developed Countries Group, one of the key negotiating blocks in climate talks representing the world’s poorest countries, said:Communities across the world are already experiencing the devastating impacts of 1C global warming. Each fraction of a degree that global temperatures rise is extremely dangerous.Limiting global temperature increases to 1.5C means significantly decreased levels of food insecurity, water shortages, destruction of infrastructure, and displacement from sea level rise and other impacts. To the lives and livelihoods of billions, that half a degree is everything.Endalew said the report made clear that there is an urgent need to “accelerate the global response to climate change to avoid exceeding the 1.5C limit”, adding:Governments must increase climate action now and submit more ambitious plans for the future. This includes increasing the level of support to developing countries to enable them to develop and lift their people out of poverty without going down a traditional, unsustainable development pathway.On the issue of loss and damage, Endalew said: This IPCC report confirms that loss and damage resulting from climate change will only worsen with further warming with much greater losses at 2C than at 1.5C. It is particularly vulnerable countries like the least developed countries that are worst affected by the devastating impacts of climate change and bear the greatest cost from the damage it causes, despite contributing the least to the problem. This injustice must be addressed by the international community through the provision of support for dealing with loss and damage.The most important message of this IPCC report is that achieving 1.5C is necessary, achievable and urgent. A safer, more prosperous future is possible with immediate action to implement transformative change across societies. There is a need to take advantage of the increasing availability of affordable, renewable and efficient energy solutions, rapidly reduce the use of fossil fuels, with coal phased out by mid-century, preserve and restore forests and soils, promote sustainable agriculture and implement other real climate solutions that together can bring about a zero-carbon economy.On the implementation guidelines for the Paris agreement that are due at COP24 in December 2018, he said:The IPCC report has made even clearer the need for the Paris rulebook to properly reflect the breadth of action required by all countries to achieve the agreement’s 1.5C goal. Countries must deliver a robust rulebook that will ensure adequate action is taken to cut emissions, adapt to climate change and address loss and damage, and that support is provided to enable poorer countries to do the same.Dr Jo House, reader in environmental science and policy at the Cabot Institute, University of Bristol, said today’s report underlines the need “to rapidly replace fossil fuel emissions with low-cost renewable energy technologies that are already widely available”.The report also highlights the urgent needs to protect forests and peatlands – these store more carbon than fossil fuel reserves, but also suck it out of the atmosphere, removing nearly a third of our current carbon dioxide emissions. Planting new forests can remove carbon from the atmosphere, as can using plants’ biomass for energy with carbon capture and storage technology. Some scenarios rely on planting up to 700Mha of land to bioenergy crops – that’s twice the size of India. To avoid relying on land for bioenergy mitigation, competing with food and nature, we have to address fossil fuel and industrial emissions. The IPCC will produce a special report on climate change and land next year to look further into land based mitigation and the co-benefits and tradeoffs.This is a good video from climate campaigner Bill McKibben (thanks for highlighting, @jessthecrip). There is no shortage of political opposition to meaningful climate action, from the US president, Donald Trump, to Brazil’s far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro. And this morning Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has put himself firmly in that category.Speaking before the IPCC report was released he said there was no money for “global climate conferences and all that nonsense”.Here is the full story from my colleague Paul Karp.George Monbiot has written a powerful thread about the threat we face and what needs to be done:More from Labour’s Rebecca Long-Bailey on Labour’s commitment to tackling climate breakdown:Caroline Lucas, MP for and former leader of the Green party, said:This report couldn’t be written in stronger terms: we are at a tipping point on the edge of complete climate breakdown, and governments around the world are failing to prevent it.Our own government is pushing us towards that tipping point with carbon intensive and ecologically destructive projects like airport expansion, fracking and HS2 – while slashing support for renewables and continuing to subsidise fossil fuels.Ministers have a choice: they can keep coating business-as-usual policies in a green veneer and watch as floods and heatwaves become the norm. Or they can embrace the opportunities to create a fairer, healthier, safer society that come with the economic overhaul we need.It is worth revisiting this piece from last week by my colleague George Monbiot, who argues that unless we kick our addiction to economic growth we can not meet the challenge posed by the unfolding climate breakdown.Given that economic growth, in nations that are already rich enough to meet the needs of all, requires an increase in pointless consumption, it is hard to see how it can ever be decoupled from the assault on the living planet.The Aldersgate Group, which represents some of the of the UK’s leading businesses, said the report sets out clear opportunities for a zero-carbon economy.This report from the world’s leading climate scientists is clear that there are compelling environmental, economic and social benefits to limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5C as envisaged in the Paris agreement. Whilst achieving such a target will require challenging emission cuts across the economy, important progress has already been made and an increase in ambition would unlock a significant innovation and investment opportunity.With strengths in areas such as offshore wind and electric vehicle manufacturing, energy efficient building design and green financial and legal services, UK businesses have a strong basis from which to accelerate emission cuts and be at the forefront of the development of the new clean technologies and services which the world economy will increasingly demand.Major economies now need to increase their existing emissions reduction pledges under the Paris agreement and adopt net zero-emissions targets in line with the conclusions of the IPCC report. The prime minister made the right call when she announced at the UN general assembly that the UK will be joining the Carbon Neutrality Coalition, especially as this follows growing public backing and cross-party support for a net zero target.The government must now begin work towards legislating for such a target in the UK, by rapidly acting on its commitment to seek the Committee on Climate Change’s advice on how the UK can ensure its climate targets are aligned with the 1.5C goal. Backed by detailed policies, such a target would accelerate investment in ultra-low-emission goods, services and infrastructure and support the innovation needed to tackle emission cuts in more challenging sectors such as land management, agriculture, long-distance transport and heavy industry.Claire Perry, minister for energy, has put out a brief statement.She added that in a “few days”, during the “first-ever Green GB Week”, the government will “outline our next steps to confront this global crisis”.Jagoda Munić, director of Friends of the Earth Europe, said the message from the report was stark, and warned that Europe was not doing enough:The fossil fuel age has to end ... To have any chance of avoiding the chaos, droughts and rising tides of 1.5C or more of global warming, we must massively and speedily transform our society to kick our fossil fuel addiction.Munic said a “safer, fairer and cleaner fossil-free” Europe was possible, with many communities already showing the way, from resisting dirty energy projects to installing community-owned renewable energy schemes.He said the EU is still planning to keep emitting carbon beyond 2050, and is currently only considering committing to “net zero emissions” by that year. He argued that as one of the regions most responsible for causing climate change, and most capable of responding, the EU needs to act at much greater speed and scale.Friends of the Earth Europe is calling on the EU to:Karin Nansen, chair of Friends of the Earth International, said:This is a climate emergency – for many around the world preventing climate catastrophe and temperature rises exceeding 1.5C is a matter of life and death. Only radical system change offers a pathway towards hope and out of despair. We want a just transition to a clean energy system that benefits people, not corporations.The Aldersgate Group, an alliance of leading business groups committed to sustainable economy, has welcomed the report.Here’s a selection of what some of its prominent members have said:Keeping global temperature increases to 1.5C will help safeguard our investment portfolios and protect our customers savings. The long-term negative financial consequences of climate change are far, far greater than the short-term financial risks of transitioning to the Paris agreement. Today’s report reiterates the need for policymakers to accelerate action to reduce carbon emissions and meet the agreed aims of the Paris agreement.Gabrielle Ginér, head of environmental sustainability at BT: Pia Heidenmark Cook, chief sustainability officer at Ikea: We will contribute by decarbonising our energy use including electricity and heating, using zero-emissions deliveries, moving to a circular business model and enabling millions of customers and co-workers to take climate action in their everyday lives.Benet Northcote, director of corporate responsibility at John Lewis Partnership:Mike Barry, director of sustainable business at Marks and Spencer: We need to take bolder, faster action and shift our mind-set to one of embracing the inevitability and opportunity of the low-carbon economy.More from the Labour party on today’s IPCC report. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, who seems to be fronting a lot of the party’s climate breakdown agenda, said the report makes clear that avoiding dangerous climate change will require “a transformational effort”:That is precisely what Labour is offering – a plan to rapidly decarbonise our energy system as part of a green jobs revolution, and a long term target of net zero emissions before 2050. This would make the UK one of the few countries in the world on track to meet the Paris agreement goals.The Tories are way off course to meeting our existing climate targets, and every day this government remains in power the window of opportunity to tackle the climate crisis shrinks. It is a cruel irony that today we were also expecting the first horizontal shale fracking in the UK – an industry the government has pushed at the expense of local communities, air quality and our climate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e16084bd66d77499bfaa80d1317b1ead61ba71d1/0_70_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6f7b65e71755bc359560fbd3ff4cbdf","title":"helena bonham carter standing up to harvey weinstein johnny depp","story":"In her 35-year career, the actor has seen the best and worst of Hollywood. She talks about orce, depression and making her most personal filmHelena Bonham Carter does not attempt to disguise her hurt. She says she has just made the most important and personal film of her career, and is convinced nobody will see it. 55 Steps tells the story of Eleanor Riese, a psychiatric patient who successfully fought the US’s medical and political establishment in the 1980s for the right to refuse antipsychotic drugs.Bonham Carter, who executive-produced the film as well as playing Riese, tried to get the movie made for 15 years, but it kept collapsing – budget problems, casting problems, director problems. Initially, she was going to play Colette Hughes, the campaigning lawyer (think Erin Brockovich) who represents Riese, with Susan Sarandon in the central role. But so much time passed that Bonham Carter ended up playing the older psychiatric patient, with Hilary Swank cast as the lawyer. And now the film is going straight to video.We meet at a restaurant close to where she lives in London. You can spot her a mile off. If she weren’t so famous, you might think she was down on her luck – massive dirty black coat and trainers disguising a gorgeous floral dress (“I wore it as a tribute to Eleanor – she loves flowers”) massive shades disguising a gorgeous girlish face. Bonham Carter is the establishment’s oddball – uninhibited, direct, forceful, funny and, at times, vulnerable. (Riese was always an outsider, but they have much in common.)She takes a bottle of Coke out of her bag, pours it discreetly into a glass and asks the waiter for ice.“I want some food,” she says to me. “Have you eaten?” She puts on her filthy reading glasses, which are hanging on a pearl lanyard. Are the pearls real? “No, but they’ve got the weight. Feel them. Look. I’ve got to get them for Margaret, because she likes pearls.” She is playing the famously hot-blooded and hot-tempered princess in the next series of The Crown. She pulls a finger across her mouth to zip it. “I’m not allowed to talk about The Crown.” She turns her attention to the menu. “I’m going to do lots of meze. Aubergine salad! Mmmm. Tabbouleh, chicken shashlik, hummus, tzatziki and some lentils.” She bursts out laughing. “I’ll just buy the whole lot.”Bonham Carter, 52, seems to have been with us for ever. She comes from a well-to-do family (her great-grandfather was the Liberal prime minister Herbert Asquith), made her name in the 1980s playing English roses in tasteful Merchant Ivory adaptations of EM Forster classics (A Room With a View, Maurice, Howards End) and evolved into something entirely grungier. She first reinvented herself in the late 90s, cast as a louche siren in David Fincher’s Fight Club. Then came a professional and romantic relationship with Tim Burton, master of the ghoulish fairytale, who cast her in unlikely, often unearthly, roles – a rebel chimp in Planet of the Apes, the Red Queen with the huge, hydrocephalised head in Alice in Wonderland, the eponymous zombie in Corpse Bride, and the adorable serial-killer Mrs Lovett in Sweeney Todd. Bonham Carter and Burton had two children (Billy Ray, now 15, and Nell, 10) and became a tabloid staple. They were fabulously eccentric – supremely childlike (the goths who never grew up) and a Hollywood power couple. One day, Bonham Carter would be photographed shopping for milk in her pyjamas, the next she would be enjoying a New Year stroll with then prime minister David Cameron. (And, no, she says, she is not a Tory – “Rule of life: you don’t have to be a Tory in order to be friends with one. Even if they end up being PM.”) There were endless stories about their wacky lives – notably the fact that they lived in adjoining cottages, and slept separately (he snored in his sleep, she talked). Even she referred to herself and Burton as “the bonkers couple”. Then, four years ago, they announced they were splitting up.“It’s a miracle this film got made,” she says of 55 Steps. “It’s fallen apart so many times.” But the more knockbacks, the more determined she was. She says she felt a responsibility to a woman who had been silenced for so much of her life. “It was like I was carrying the baton for Eleanor. The main thing she wanted was to be heard.”The film is called 55 Steps because, among other things, Riese had OCD – she was an obsessive counter of her footsteps, and had to climb 55 steps for her first day in the San Francisco court. Has Bonham Carter ever had OCD? “No. I’ve had depression. My periods of depression usually relate to the end of things. But I don’t have rituals. I’ve had times when my mind is not helping me.” She stops. “Actually, when I was little, I did. I used to jump up and down three times. This was just before I did the 11-plus. I thought if I didn’t do it, I wouldn’t get in. It obviously worked.”The curious thing is, she says, it only gradually dawned on her just how personal a film this is. She shows me a picture on her iPhone of her younger self, little more than a toddler. “I look so concerned. Already worried. I was a worrier.” After the death of her grandfather, her mother, Elena, had a breakdown Bonham Carter was five. “Grief can bring a hell of a lot of other stuff up,” she says. “But she always felt her breakdown was a gift. Mum has been a real example of wearing her depression and her mental frailty as a badge of honour. She’s saying: ‘Look at what I survived.’” (Her mother trained as a psychotherapist when she recovered, and still practises today at 84.)When her mother had her breakdown, says Bonham Carter, “she had a recurring dream that she was eating her father – carving him up and eating him. She thought it was the most horrifying dream, and the therapist she ended up seeing said: ‘What did he taste like?’ And she said: ‘No one’s ever asked me that. Really sweet.’ After that, the dream went. Suddenly it was solved.”The family links to 55 Steps run deeper. When Riese was 10 years old, she contracted meningitis, and an operation went wrong, leaving her with brain damage. When Bonham Carter was 13, her father, Raymond, a banker, was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma – a noncancerous growth – in the brain cortex. The surgeon prolonged the operation by six hours to try to save his facial nerve he subsequently had a post-operative stroke that left him paralysed and cortically blind. She adored her father. “He was amazing. He was so clever and flipping hilarious. When somebody is so disabled, other bits compensate. He got even brainier, and more bold. My dad sat down for 25 years of his life. He was never upright. The only time I saw him upright was when he came down the stairs in his mortuary bag.”It was only when she was shooting a scene towards the end of 55 Steps that Bonham Carter linked her father’s experience with Riese’s. “I thought: ‘Of course I’m doing this film because of my flipping father because he also had a medical intervention on the brain that went wrong.’”The food arrives, with a glass of wine for me (Bonham Carter sticks to her Coke). “It’s so yellow!” she says. “It looks like a urine sample.” She gets the giggles.She talks about how optimistic she was when 55 Steps was finished. It premiered at the 2017 Toronto film festival, the two real-life lawyers (Hughes and Mort Cohen, played by Jeffrey Tambor) attended the screening, and it got a rapturous ovation. “Mort came up to me and said: ‘You have no idea how much this is going to help this film will do more to raise awareness of people like Eleanor than anything I can do.’ Then no one bought it.”Why does she think that was? “One or two reviews were OK about me and another two really assassinated me. I was like, maybe they’re right, maybe it is completely over the top. There was one really horrible one and at the end of it somebody tweeted and said: ‘Excuse me, I knew Eleanor and she pitched her perfectly.’ When Colette saw the film she said: ‘You’ve resurrected her.’ So I felt a bit of vindication.”Of course, it’s a big performance, Bonham Carter says – Riese was a big personality. “What I didn’t like about it was that they assumed I was being patronising. I am the last person to patronise this woman. I am her biggest champion.” Her voice rises. “Don’t you dare level that accusation. Maybe I’m a crap actor, but don’t don’t don’t say that I’m patronising her.” She is right it is a big performance. But it is a big, touching, life-affirming performance that could just as easily have been Oscar-nominated as panned.A number of people Bonham Carter has worked with have been caught up in abuse allegations. Johnny Depp, who starred with her in five films Burton directed, was accused of being “verbally and physically abusive” by his former wife Amber Heard after they separated. Depp denied the allegations and Heard dropped her domestic abuse case against him. Did the allegations affect her relationship with Depp? “No. Johnny is still a friend. He’s the godfather to my children. I haven’t seen him for a long time. But he’s quite an elusive character.” Silence.What does she think of the #MeToo movement? “It is definitely a good thing that #MeToo has happened. Any kind of abuse is not on. But I think one has to be careful. You have to be absolutely rigorous about what somebody has done to stand up and accuse them. You have to honour #MeToo.”The #MeToo movement began on social media after the first abuse allegations were made against film producer Harvey Weinstein, with whom she has also worked. When I ask about Weinstein her response is typically measured. “Nobody is wholly bad and nobody is wholly good. He was very clever. There are a lot of reasons he was very powerful. He knew how to get you Oscar nominations. Both my nominations are due to him. And he had great taste in films.” What was the downside? “I found the way he treated certain people chilling – without any kind of respect. There were many times I disagreed with the way he behaved, and I don’t mean sexually.” He was bullying? “Yes. There were times when Harvey asked me to do certain things, and I said no. I knew I was running a thin line. Standing up to him wasn’t an easy thing to do because I knew I could potentially lose work.”Why could she stand up to Weinstein when so many others couldn’t? “Because I already had a career. Other people were employing me. I wasn’t reliant on him.” Despite this, she says, she did discover the cost of disobeying him when working on the Jean-Pierre Jeunet film The Young and Prodigious TS Spivet, about a genius boy who runs away from home. “Harvey wanted me to tell Jeunet to change it. There is a scene in which he hitchhikes and Harvey said as soon as that kid gets into a truck everyone will think the truck driver is a child molester and all the kids in America will be freaked out. I said: ‘I don’t think you’re right, and I’m not going to tell Jean-Pierre Jeunet I know better than him.’” What did Weinstein say to her? “‘You’ve got to tell that arrogant asshole he’s being a shit, he doesn’t know the American market like I do.’ I found it revolting.”Did she think Weinstein’s behaviour would come back to haunt him? “No, absolutely not.” Because he was too powerful? “Yes.” Had she heard allegations of sex abuse? “I was aware certain actresses had had sex with him, but I thought it was consensual.” Did her experience put her off working with him? “No. It’s a business.”Bonham Carter is admirably honest about Weinstein. As she is about the end of her relationship with Burton. Reports have suggested they still live side by side in their adjoining cottages, but she says this is untrue. Earlier, she mentioned that she tended to get depression when things end. Did she have a bout after they split up? “I had a depression, definitely. I think when you’re with somebody your identity is wrapped up with that person, so it’s a loss of identity when you break up. I wouldn’t say orce is the easiest thing.” Were they married? “No, but we were emotionally married. We’re family. So even when you know something is meant to end, that it’s had its proper life, you still have to grieve for all the good bits. It’s a whole massive re-formation.” There have been rumours that they will get back together, but she says she now thinks of the relationship as the past. “I think we’ll have a friendship because we made the two greatest things in the world.” Do they share custody of the children? “Yes.” She pauses. “Well, they share us.” Is there anybody new in her life? She grins. “I’ve got two bunnies and a tortoise. I’m not prepared to talk about my friends.” Pause. That sounds like a yes? “Maybe.” She tugs at a huge silver hairpin that says “Maybe”. “Look there’s a Maybe in my hair.”She talks about how the world has been turned on its head in recent years – Trump, #MeToo, Brexit (“God, it’s a disaster. Now we know what we’re talking about there’s no doubt we should have another referendum”).After all the grieving, she says, she now feels positive. “I’ve got a whole new life. It’s fun. It’s less boring. It’s got a whole new unpredictability. It’s really nice.”She is also excited about her work. While so many middle-aged female actors bemoan the lack of interesting work, Bonham Carter feels it is getting more interesting. After all the bonnets and Burton-inspired weirdness she is establishing herself as a character actor, with the rare ability to do frumpy (Enid Blyton and Riese) and glam (Elizabeth Taylor in the fine TV drama Burton and Taylor, and her forthcoming Princess Margaret in The Crown).It is time to leave. But she is still thinking about 55 Steps. She says she knows it might sound funny, but she genuinely believes Eleanor Riese has helped her through her tough times. “I think it’s probably the best thing I’ve done. The irony is that I think three people will see it. But, luckily, even if you are in a nominal flop, as an actor you always have the gift of playing someone who’ll leave her imprint on your soul and psyche. I’m a wiser, more joyous person for having known her.”55 Steps is available to buy and rent from 15 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/325fdeebff6eb04a3e0ca737398901765c4d3fbb/0_943_6963_4178/master/6963.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edccc0bbcea794a57b4bd807caaff8a4","title":"roman beans pork rind recipe rachel roddy","story":"Centuries have taught working-class Romans to conjure up flavour and goodness from leftovers and offcuts, such as this traditional recipe for a rich stew of beans and pork“If sweetbreads and oxtail aren’t your thing, then don’t come here.” They are my thing, so I put a ring around the entry for Trattoria Agustarello in Testaccio in my 2005 Lonely Planet Italy. It wasn’t until a month or so later that I made it there, by which time I knew a bit about Testaccio, its second-century hill of broken terracotta pots and its graveyard of dead poets, its contemporary history as the slaughterhouse district and its particular cooking. The butchers and vaccinari (cow men) who worked the slaughterhouse from the 1880s until the mid-1970s ided animals into prestigious cuts for the wealthy, leaving the lower classes and slaughterhouse workers the offcuts and offal, the quinto quarto, or fifth quarter.The slaughterhouse may have closed in 1975 and habits are changing, but, in Testaccio, quinto quarto cooking is still alive, and nowhere more than in Trattoria Agustarello. There have been small adjustments to the half-open kitchen and the walls are now a sunny yellow, but apart from that, Agustarello feels much the same as it did the first time I went, 13 years ago.Also defying the years is chefowner Alessandro, who like his father before him, smokes slim cigars and cooks a menu where – as the Lonely Planet noted – “virtually every dish (other than pasta) in this old-fashioned trattoria has some correlation to the innards of an animal”.If offal is not your thing, I doubt you’ve read this far. If it is, and you like tripe cooked in tomato with mint and pecorino cheese, or oxtail simmered with celery, tomato and red wine until it’s the colour of a horse chestnut and falling from the bone, or enjoy the crunch of veal cartilage (think chicken cartilage only better) with pickled vegetables, then Agustarello is the place for you.It is also a place to enjoy classic Roman pastas – gricia, carbonara, amatriciana – whose form and deep flavour comes from guanciale (cured pig cheeks), bitter tangles of twice-cooked cicoria or chicory, braised artichokes and a vignarola, or Roman spring stew of broad beans, artichoke and peas that laughs like Jack Nicholson in the face of my bright green version. It is not food I would want to eat all the time, but food I want to eat sometimes.Alessandro also makes the most delicious fagioli e cotiche, beans and pork rind, which I might not have ordered were it not for the fact that I thought cotiche was sausage (that would be cotechino, the new-year treat that does contain a proportion of pork rind). To make it, pork rind (about 130g, hairs burned away, and trimmed of all but a couple of millimetres of fat) is boiled in water for 15 minutes, drained, cut into one-inch-wide strips and then boiled again in clean water until tender, which takes about an hour and a half.The rind is then cut into 2mm-thick matchsticks, and mixed with tomato sauce, a little water and cooked cannellini or borlotti beans, then simmered until the sauce is rich. The combination of the beans, sauce and pork rind is a dish that is thick, rich and delicious, and – with bread and plenty of red wine – a good thing if it is your sort of thing.Serves 4300g dried cannellini or borlotti beans, soaked in water for at least 12 hours120g pork rind, with all but 2mm of fat trimmed awayOlive oil1 small onion, peeled and diced1 garlic clove, peeled and dicedA sprig of parsley, stem and leaves finely chopped300ml tomato passata (or a tin of tomatoes passed through a food mill)Salt and black pepperCook the soaked beans in plenty of water until it boils, then reduce to a steady simmer until tender – about an hour depending on the beans.

Once in a blue moon, I had the perfect one: sweet, juicy with a hint of crispness and delicate floral notes – how I loved those pears! Sadly, more often than not, they are rock-hard or mushy. Then I started keeping them in the fridge and I have not looked back. Make this delicate, creamy tart with pears that are still quite firm. It makes a stunning pudding.For the pastry190g plain flour, plus extra for dusting30g icing sugarA pinch of salt100g chilled butter, chopped, plus extra for greasing 1 egg, separated, the white lightly beaten For the pears1 large thumb fresh ginger, peeled and finely slicedZest and juice of 1 lime200g caster sugar500ml water4-5 firm pears (depending on size), peeled, cored and halvedFor the filling3 eggs75g caster sugar200g creme fraiche2 tsp ground cinnamonFirst, make the pastry by blitzing the flour, icing sugar, salt and butter in a food processor for 20-30 seconds. Add the egg yolk, blitz again until incorporated, then add just enough egg white to bind it all together (reserve the rest for later). Roll the dough into a ball, flatten slightly, wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest in the fridge for at least half an hour.Now coarsely grate the pastry into a 25cm tart tin. Press evenly across the base and up the sides with your fingers, sprinkle with a little flour and use a small glass to roll it flat. Prick the base all over with a fork, then freeze for 20 minutes.Make a sugar syrup by putting the ginger, lime zest and juice, sugar and water into a wide pan and bringing to simmering point. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the pears and cover with a round of greaseproof paper to keep them submerged. Simmer for 10-20 minutes, until tender, then cool.Heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Remove the pastry from the freezer, cover with baking paper and some baking beans, and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the beans and paper, brush the base with the remaining egg white and return to the oven for five to 10 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Remove, leave to cool and turn down the heat to 180C350Fgas 4.For the filling, beat together the eggs and caster sugar, then stir in the creme fraiche and cinnamon. Remove the pears from their poaching liquid. Cut the halves into slices and arrange around the tart case, then pour over the filling (if you have too much, see below). Place Put in the middle of the oven for 20-25 minutes until just set. Rest for 20 minutes before serving.The filling is delicious with blackberries. I also love to make the tart with nutmeg instead of cinnamon, poaching the pears with a bay leaf and red wine instead of a straight stock syrup. You can make a blue cheese, chicory and toasted walnut salad with the leftover pears, too – one of my desert island dishes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b213f320614afed172fcb6a9b179cf279fced85/0_0_4305_2583/master/4305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b082e72d771622f7325bc036fbf2501b","title":"pep guardiola commandments manchester city liverpool tactics","story":"Pep Guardiola went back to the basics of Cruyffism at Anfield and in doing so showed new-found flexibility and pragmatismEighteen games into Pep Guardiola’s second season as manager of Bayern Munich, his side lost 4-1 at Wolfsburg. It was their first defeat of the campaign and a major surprise, and it made Guardiola stop and reconsider. Had he been overthinking things? Had he got so carried away with his experiments in using his full-backs in possession effectively as old-fashioned wing-halves that he had forgotten the basics? Determined he shouldn’t make the same mistake again, he wrote what he came to refer to as “the Bible” on the whiteboard in his office.It was a very short Bible, containing only three key strictures. He would deploy:• Two against four in attack• An extra man in midfield• An extra man in defenceThese were very Cruyffian values, the second and third commandments echoing the line Guardiola had written in his 2001 memoir La meva gent, el meu futbol to explain the thinking of his great mentor Johan Cruyff on basic formations. The priority, he had said, was “to fill the centre of the pitch in order to play having numerical superiority”.There are, of course, numerous other factors that come into play when setting up a team, and there have been many occasions when Guardiola has not faced 4-3-3 with 4-4-2, but for Guardiola these three principles form the central idea. And that, perhaps, explains the set-up against Liverpool on Sunday.Against Liverpool’s three-man forward line, a trident he had admitted before the game that scares him, he deployed a back four. A back three had worked in the 5-0 win at the Etihad last season – and to an extent, before his own dismissal at half-time, in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final – but, despite the availability of Benjamin Mendy, who gives him the option of setting up with a back three and wing-backs, he preferred a four. Mendy was given a certain licence, but Guardiola avoided the dangers of having both full-backs push on simultaneously by having Kyle Walker play in a more restrained way than usual, often tucking in as a de facto third centre-back.But it was the shape of the rest of the team that was so striking. Rather than the usual midfield, Guardiola included an extra man, obeying the command to play two against four in attack by deploying a 4-4-2. Fernandinho and Bernardo Silva occupied the centre, supported, as they had to be if they were not to be overmanned, by Raheem Sterling and Riyad Mahrez. The wide players tucked in, playing much deeper than has been usual for wide players at City this season, both helping out in the centre and offering protection for the full-backs.As it turned out, with Jürgen Klopp also opting to use his full-backs in a more conservative way, bringing in Dejan Lovren and shifting Joe Gomez to right-back in place of the more obviously attacking Trent Alexander-Arnold, the battle on the flanks became much cagier than had been anticipated.The third prong of the plan was the use of David Silva as a second striker just behind Sergio Agüero. That fitted a more general trend that has seen strike pairings begin to re-emerge as it has become apparent that central defensive pairings have forgotten how to deal with two strikers (so both have to mark rather than one marking and the other dropping off as cover) but, because Silva often dropped deep, it also put pressure on the back of Liverpool’s midfield, an area in which they can look vulnerable.As it turned out, Jordan Henderson had a very good game, but it is difficult for a midfield three to press with full confidence when it is always having to look over its shoulder to see what is happening in the gap between it and the back four.The game, in truth, was probably not the spectacle most were hoping for, but in applying the lessons of Wolfsburg, in going back to the basics of Cruyffism, Guardiola demonstrated a flexibility and a pragmatism he has often eschewed in the past. It might not be as much fun as the days of “Sorry guys, this is how I play” but in terms of getting results away against elite opponents, it may turn out to be more effective."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e224bdf05dbc7cd5b3a7b9b74cddd8ff4d52a4f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3971a5d20ae9049f9ce894a8c33fa377","title":"premier league 10 talking points from weekend action","story":"A call to get tougher on ing, Arsenal are turning up the volume and Everton’s biggest investments are coming goodDeclan Rice faces a big decision over his international future after once again being left out of the Republic of Ireland squad for the Nations League matches against Denmark and Wales as he ponders switching allegiances to England. The versatile 19-year-old – who qualifies for Ireland through his grandparents – already has three senior caps and represented them at several youth levels but remains eligible for the country of his birth under current Fifa regulations. He performed well in a defensive midfield role despite West Ham’s improved run of results coming to an end against Brighton on Friday and looks like the kind of player who could excel in Gareth Southgate’s young England side if given an opportunity. Manuel Pellegrini said Rice must take his time to decide but the best advice for him is to follow his heart. Ed AaronsThose who play the game will tell you that ing cases are not always open and shut. But sometimes footballers just cheat. That is what Laurent Depoitre did at Turf Moor, throwing himself to the ground in the box amid no hint of contact with his side a goal down, and Sean Dyche could not hide his disgust afterwards. It was “embarrassing”, the Burnley manager said, before suggesting the only way to stop such offences is to impose far stiffer sanctions than the yellow card Depoitre received. A sending off would certainly have made it harder for Huddersfield to equalise, as they did a few minutes later through Christopher Schindler, and they did not deserve to lose. But they are still yet to win and Depoitre will need to apply himself properly, rather than attempting to con the officials, if he is to have any hope of helping them stay up. Nick AmesWolves are purring in the league and continuity is a part of that. The same XI has started all eight matches since their return to the Premier League. There is continuity with last season, too. Despite the £60m spent this summer by the owners, Fosun International, seven of the starters were part of Wolves’ Championship‑winning team. Beyond that, there is Matt Doherty. Scorer of a deserved winner at Crystal Palace, he played for Wolves the last time they were in the top flight. The former trainee has also been in the team throughout Nuno Espírito Santo’s year in charge and spoke of his “massive pride” at remaining part of the Molineux revolution. “A lot of managers, new owners, they could have just wiped me out and said we are going with someone new but I have got my head down,” he said. “I’ve played well when I have needed to and I am still here, so long may it continue.” Paul MacInnesUnai Emery was having none of the post-match “Can Arsenal win the title?” questions, preferring to filibuster his way through a rambling response with mentions of “work”, “calm”, “mentality” and “enjoy”. But a nine-match winning run in all competitions – the kind of sequence only Herbert Chapman, George Graham and Arsène Wenger have previously overseen at the club – might just have some of their more optimistic supporters dreaming. That sequence may well be extended. The most daunting of their next four fixtures is at Sporting Lisbon in the Europa League and, by the time Liverpool arrive at the Emirates Stadium next month, they might have won 13 in a row. They will need to muster a dominant display against Jürgen Klopp’s side if they are truly to banish the memories of those defeats by Manchester City and Chelsea at the start of Emery’s tenure but, for the first time in a while, Arsenal have genuine cause for optimism. Dominic FifieldEverton’s two most expensive signings, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Richarlison, have thrived so far this season and scored the goals that brought victory at Leicester. But Bernard, hired for no transfer fee, was the most exciting performer on his first league start of the season. With that trio, each deployed in the positions where they can do most damage, Everton have an attack that should trouble any team. While showing how promisingly they are developing, Marco Silva’s side also exposed the persistent vulnerabilities in an otherwise fine Leicester team: neither Daniel Amartey nor Ricardo Pereira look secure on the right, and Wes Morgan’s best days at centre‑back are behind him. The captain’s second ban of the season will give Jonny Evans a route back into the starting lineup and it will be surprising if the Northern Irishman does not stay there. Paul DoyleIt is astonishing that Manchester City don’t have anyone but Sergio Agüero who is capable of taking a penalty. In the end, with the Argentinian on the bench, the decision appeared to come down to Gabriel Jesús – who has scored one of three in this country – and Riyad Mahrez – who had missed four of his last seven, now five of his last eight. When Manchester United recently lost to Derby on penaltiesJosé Mourinho infamously said that “after the sixth, the seventh I knew we’d be in trouble with Phil Jones and Eric Bailly”. With City it seems the wobbles come after penalty No 1 (and even Agüero has missed four of the 15 he has taken in the last two seasons). Their next most experienced penalty taker was David Silva, who last took a penalty for City more than six years ago and missed. Of those players who were not present Kevin de Bruyne missed the only penalty he has taken for the club and Ilkay Gündogan has also taken only one penalty for City, scoring at Tottenham in April. But perhaps there is one other decent candidate. “I would have definitely scored,” said goalkeeper Ederson after Jesús missed from the spot in a 5-0 win over Swansea in April. Simon BurntonIt was disappointing to see that there was no room on Chelsea’s bench for Ruben Loftus-Cheek. The England midfielder started in the Europa League victory over Vidi last Thursday and he could have been forgiven for thinking that he would get another chance to impress in the 3-0 win over Southampton. However Maurizio Sarri had other ideas. Loftus-Cheek has just returned from injury and Sarri wants to see tactical and physical improvement in training before looking at him in the Premier League. Yet the 22-year-old should not be too downhearted. Perhaps he can take encouragement from the way that Ross Barkley is developing under Sarri. Barkley was in danger of becoming the forgotten man at Stamford Bridge last season but he registered a goal and assist against Southampton. While Chelsea are often criticised for not giving enough minutes to young English players, Barkley’s resurgence is an encouraging sign for Loftus-Cheek. Jacob SteinbergThe weather was miserable on Saturday and for Cardiff City it was another bleak afternoon following an eighth game without a win and a subsequent slide to last place. Yet afterwards Neil Warnock described himself as proud of his side’s display and was right to do so. The visitors showed resilience against Tottenham Hotspur, particularly after being reduced to 10 men, and produced six shots on target, the most Cardiff have managed in a league fixture this season. That came on the back of the five they had in the previous week’s defeat to Burnley, suggesting the Welsh team are finding their feet from an attacking point of view. This still feels like it is going to be a trying campaign for Cardiff but relegation may not necessarily be a formality, especially given they are not cut adrift from those above them. Sachin NakraniHaving been, at the very worst, competitive in each of their first seven fixtures this was a bizarre and frequently inept display from Watford against opponents who defended ably in the brief period they were required to and counterattacked ruthlessly. In particular, the Hornets’ reaction to having a centre-back sent off after half an hour was puzzling: there was a direct replacement on the bench, but instead they chose to crowbar Étienne Capoue into their back four, with calamitous results. Adrian Mariappa finally came on after 55 minutes and Watford’s defending instantly improved, though by then Bournemouth were four up. “It has been the first game where we hadn’t competed at the same level as other games,” said Javi Gracia, but it wasn’t just on the pitch that Watford’s decision-making appeared faulty.

But there are steps we can take to mitigate its effectsLast month, air pollution was named as the biggest risk to public health in Europe. It is responsible for the early deaths of an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year, 40,000 of whom are in the UK. Moreover, the UK, among other countries, regularly breaches EU pollution limits – which are lower than the World Health Organization standards. London reached its legal limit for 2018 in just one month, and a report by the WHO in May found 30 British towns and cities, including Manchester, Swansea, Leicester and York, that exceeded WHO limits.Air pollution has been linked not only to lung disease, but cardiovascular disease, stroke and dementia. Besides that, it has been linked to lower cognitive function, and a rise in mental illness and asthma in children. While it is already known that air pollution can increase the risk of premature birth, it was recently reported that scientists have discovered particles of pollution in mothers’ placentas, and that the pollution may have reached foetuses. And, last month, a study found that children in the UK were absorbing a disproportionate amount of toxic black carbon particles from diesel engines on the way to and from school, and even in classrooms and playgrounds. The main solution, of course, is to drastically reduce pollution, but in the meantime, what can we do to protect ourselves?“You get an exponential reduction,” says Prashant Kumar, director of the Global Centre for Clean Air Research at the University of Surrey. Within the first few metres of the roadside, “the concentrations are really high and then they dilute quite quickly. Within 50 or 100 metres, depending on the pollutant types, they reduce to at least half of their concentrations.”Air pollution apps, says Stephen Holgate, a professor of immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton and an air pollution expert, are “quite good and they’re improving. There are apps where a city or town has a real-time update of what the air pollution is, so you can make choices about where to avoid ... they’re really helpful.” London Air was developed by King’s College London and shows levels of pollution at sites across the city. Holgate also points to the growing market in personal sensors, which – when paired with a phone – can monitor levels of pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. However, scientists, and bodies such as the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the US Environmental Protection Agency, have warned they are still in their infancy and their measurements may not be reliable.In the UK, even with our sometimes illegally high air pollution, the benefits of exercise seem to outweigh the risks of pollution exposure, says De Nazelle. “Theoretically, it makes sense that physical activity would protect you from the harms of air pollution,” she says. “There are many benefits to exercise, but one is reducing inflammation and one of the major mechanisms of air pollution on health is to increase inflammation in the body. By doing physical activity, you’re combating the negative effects of air pollution. It’s hard to prove at this point but there is some indication that that’s the case.”As for days when pollution is high, De Nazelle says: “It’s hard to say if it really makes sense to go running along high traffic roads, we don’t really know. If you’re very young or very old, or you have a heart or respiratory condition then you are probably better off not being physically active outdoors on days of high-level air pollution.”Is there a best time of day to exercise? “Avoid rush hour, basically,” says De Nazelle. “And right before the rush hour is probably better than right afterwards.” Early in the morning may be better, says Kumar. During the morning rush hour, he found that levels of PM2.5 – particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less, which can penetrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream – were higher than in the afternoon rush hour.The researchers are currently running experiments on whether different types of pram or pushchair are better (forward-facing or backward-facing, for instance), but in the meantime, Kumar advises staying away from busy roads where possible and using a cover, which will reduce some but not all pollution, particularly at hotspots such as traffic lights, bus stops and junctions. A plastic raincover will do, although he points out it won’t be snug (so pollution will leak in) and it could be uncomfortable for the child in hot weather. Products such as a baby pillow that filters the air around a child’s breathing area are about to come on to the market. “The permanent solution,” says Kumar, “is to tackle the source – the vehicles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39082930426176007cb1d524a4d30f3b2ed028f1/0_148_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8de58400fbbd7063a5de23e9e2d2b38","title":"bark if you want to stop brexit wooferendum in pictures","story":"Anti-Brexit dog owners and pets join the protest rally in London for a ‘people’s vote’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/994128ddffdc5034600e71403bf8cbf1832635b2/0_181_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b55e08943deb958ad47c1e745dbc817","title":"we rent in brixton should we move out of london to buy","story":"We’ve been looking at places around the south-east, but they seem dull and boringQ I rent a two-bed flat in Brixton with my husband and two daughters who are eight months old and two.

This is pushing down optimism over future prospects as firms fear their trading relations with customers in the European Union could be disrupted next year.“CFOs have become more pessimistic about the long-term effect of the UK’s departure from the EU,” Ian Stewart, the chief economist at Deloitte, said.“Indeed, CFOs are more negative about the effects of Brexit today than at any time since the EU referendum.” British businesses are increasingly worried that Britain might crash out of the EU in March 2019 without a transition arrangement. The outgoing chief executive of the insurance market Lloyd’s of London, Inga Beale, revealed on Sunday that her firm is accelerating Brexit contingency plans to transfer contracts to a Brussels subsidiary, with the risk of a no-deal Brexit rising.“We’re accelerating that plan as it seems to me we might be closer to a no deal than we were,” Beale told the BBC.The British Chambers of Commerce is also concerned that Brexit uncertainty is hurting the UK economy and dragging down growth.The BCC also reported a slowdown in the number of manufacturers reporting higher export orders, despite the weaker pound making UK exports more competitive.Factories are suffering from a rise in raw material costs, which is forcing many to raise their own prices.Dr Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, warned that UK businesses are “stuck in limbo” as negotiations with the EU rumble on.“These figures reinforce what we are hearing from businesses up and down the country – the uncertainty over Brexit, and the lack of bold moves to boost business at home, are starting to bite,” Marshall said.“It should be a matter of grave concern to government that sales and orders both at home and abroad are stagnating.

Any other deal sells us short. I put the prime minister on notice we will not support any measure that threatens Scottish jobs and living standards.”His speech echoes a warning on Sunday from Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, who said it was “almost inevitable” the SNP would vote against whatever deal May produced, since the UK government would never table an offer to stay in the EU single market.“We will not sit back and allow Scotland to be dragged out of the single market and customs union against its will. We will not be complicit in a blind or a no-deal Brexit. Friends, when the time comes to vote on a Brexit deal, the only deal we will accept is one that keeps Scotland in the single market and the customs union. Any other deal sells us short.”Their ultimatum will increase pressure on May and the EU to produce a compromise deal that commands a cross-party majority large enough to neutralise the votes of Conservative Brexit hardliners. If the SNP sticks to its stance, that will require backing from Labour.It also raises the prospect of the SNP’s MPs walking through the same ision lobbies in the Commons as Brexit hardliners such as Jacob Rees Mogg and Boris Johnson, who would reject any deal designed to find a middle-ground compromise on Brexit.Sturgeon and Blackford have also backed the alternative route of staging a second EU referendum, where the question would be to accept the deal or remain in the union.Both doubt such a vote will take place because it would never be supported by the UK government, but they have decided they cannot be seen to obstruct or dismiss the proposal, even it it remains hypothetical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee17e2273717f67beda3abae8fe170c1d197d072/3_230_3026_1816/master/3026.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f2ef5e734c655783fd0c6a6ff54b455","title":"welsh labour leadership hopeful mark drakeford backs jeremy corbyn","story":"Mark Drakeford was the only Welsh cabinet member to vote for Jeremy Corbyn in 2015The frontrunner to become the next Welsh first minister is describing himself as a “21st-century socialist” and making clear his solidarity with the UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.Mark Drakeford, who is launching his campaign on Monday to become leader of Labour in Wales, also says the party is still reeling from the death of Carl Sargeant, who killed himself after being sacked as a minister amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour to women.Drakeford is on the centre left of the Welsh Labour party. At the time, he was the only member of the Welsh cabinet that voted for Corbyn in his first leadership bid in 2015.The current Welsh Labour leader and first minister, Carwyn Jones, who is stepping down following a torrid time since Sargeant’s death, has been more lukewarm about Corbyn and has always emphasised that Welsh Labour is a different beast to the UK party.Drakeford says he has never regretted backing Corbyn. “The reasons why I support Jeremy Corbyn, and the democratisation of our party lie in the political tradition to which I belong – the mainstream radical, Welsh socialist tradition.“If I am first minister, I want to lead a Wales where government invests in the conditions in which wealth is created – investing in people and in places. But for me that is common wealth, the wealth to which everyone makes a contribution and from which the fruits are then shared out fairly for all.”Drakeford used to work as special adviser for the former first minister Rhodri Morgan, one of the most charismatic of Welsh politicians in recent years, who famously advocated “clear red water” between Welsh Labour and the UK party – then led by Tony Blair. Drakeford appears to be signalling that this ide is no longer needed.He says he has learned a lot from his time with Morgan. “It provided me with a unique insight into what it takes to be a first minister, the pressures which that office brings, and the possibilities it opens. Being first minister is unlike any other job in government and I know from the inside.“Since becoming an assembly member myself in 2011 I have been Labour’s health minister and today, am the minister for both finance and Brexit. Whoever is the next first minister will face the pressures caused by the longest and deepest period of austerity we have ever known. She or he will also take up office just at the point when the Brexit negotiations finally come to a head.“Labour’s next first minister will have to be able to grapple with those enormous challenges from the moment of election – there will be no time to learn on the job.”Drakeford will also speak about the “distressing and draining” time members of the Labour group at the assembly have faced since Sargeant’s death.The current first minister has come in for fierce criticism over his handling of Sargeant’s sacking and faces an inquiry over it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fbc36ac670cfd975207f457fa37ecf429163b70/0_199_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2965a259a281041565c64831bc6bd0b6","title":"labour and tory mayors unite to demand they take back control of regional spending after brexit politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenLiam Fox, the international trade secretary, has welcomed the Japanese prime minister’s comment in a Financial Times interview (see 10.12am) that the UK would be welcome to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after Brexit.I’m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. And, after Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, talking up the prospects of a Brexit deal being reached at the end of last week, this morning Downing Street is adopting a more downbeat note. The prime minister’s spokesman told reporters:We have always said that we are working hard for a deal this autumn, and that continues at pace.It is worth me pointing out that there’s a difference between people talking optimistically about a deal and a deal, including both a withdrawal agreement and the future framework, actually being agreed. There remain big issues to work through and, as the PM has said, this will require movement on the EU side.I will just make that point again that there can be no withdrawal agreement without a precise future framework.It is hard to be sure quite how much to read into this. During any complex negotiation of this kind, there is always “hopes for a deal risehopes for a deal fall” see-saw in the reporting as both sides manage expectations. If you’re a foreign exchange trader, I wouldn’t quite dump sterling quite yet. But the spokesman did make it very clear that the government does not expect the entire deal to be finalised next week, and his words did serve as a reality check to anyone thinking, on the basis of Juncker’s comments, that it’s all done and dusted.I will post a full summary of the briefing shortly.Ian Blackford also said the SNP would cause “maximum disruption” at Westminster, the BBC’s Philip Sim reports.That’s interesting, if the SNP does act on this threat. In June Blackford tried to hold up PMQs by demanding a vote on the Commons sitting in private half way through the exchanges. But John Bercow, the Speaker, did not allow the vote, and Blackford ended up being suspended. SNP MPs walked out in sympathy. The protest attracted a lot of coverage, but did not disrupt government business, and since then the SNP have not tried anything similar.I’m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am.According to the Herald’s Tom Gordon, Ian Blackford also joined the long list of those people who have said breakfast instead of Brexit.Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, has been speaking at the party conference in Glasgow. According to the extracts from the speech released by the party, he said the SNP would not be complicit in a “blind” Brexit (meaning a deal so vague that it is not clear what the future trade relationship will look like). He told delegates:The SNP will not sit back and allow Scotland to be dragged out of the single market and customs union against its will. We will not be complicit in a blind - or a no deal Brexit.The Tories are on a reckless mission to trash our economy. Their self-destructive policies on Brexit, austerity and immigration threaten serious and lasting harm.An extreme Brexit threatens £2,300 lost from every person in Scotland 80,000 Scottish jobs destroyed the door shut to talented EU workers and our economy smaller, weaker and poorer.The people of Scotland didn’t vote for this Tory government, they didn’t vote to have a referendum on leaving the EU, they didn’t vote for Brexit, they didn’t vote for a hard Brexit and they certainly didn’t vote to come crashing out of the EU with no deal.Time and time again, the SNP and others have fought to ensure that Scotland’s remain vote is respected in the EU negotiations – but the Tory Cabinet is completely in thrall to the hardline Brexiteers who could not care less about jobs, living standards and public services in Scotland.Yesterday the Sunday Times (paywall) carried a story saying some Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group are so opposed to Theresa May’s Chequers plan that they have been talking about voting down the budget.This seems to have prompted Douglas Carswell, the former Tory MP who was so pro-Brexit he defected to Ukip, to criticise its tactics. Greg Hands, the former international trade minister, has welcomed the news that the Japanese prime minister has said the UK will be welcome to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after Brexit.Steve Peers, a trade law professor, points out that this is less significant than it sounds.We’ve got two other live blogs on the go today worth keeping an eye on.Matthew Taylor and other colleagues have been covering reaction to the new IPCC report on climate change here.And Graeme Wearden is covering the announcement of the winner of the Nobel prize for economics.The BBC’s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has posted a good round-up of where we are in the Brexit process in a Twitter thread. It starts here.“Take back control”, the Vote Leave rallying cry, was one of the most effective political slogans in recent times. And today it has been appropriated by four metro mayors from the North of England, three Labour and one Tory, who have united to demand that they get control of the regional funding promised by the government to replace EU structural funds after Brexit.EU structural funds are spent on deprived areas and, taking into account UK government match funding, they have been worth around £2.4bn a year to the UK. It their 2017 manifesto the Tories promised to replace it after Brexit with a shared prosperity fund (SPF), but the government has yet to give details of how the SPF will work.The four mayors who want to “take back control” are Labour’s Andy Burnham (Greater Manchester), Steve Rotheram (Liverpool City region) and Dan Jarvis (Sheffied City region) and the Conservative Ben Houchen (Tees Valley). In a joint statement released this morning they say:More than two years since the Brexit referendum, the defining mantra of that campaign – to take back control – looms large as we approach March 2019. If that phrase is to mean anything, it must mean substantial devolution of power and resources out of Westminster to the English regions.The UK’s employment rate has recently hit record highs and many of our city centres are thriving hubs of commerce and culture. But some places remain locked out of this success story.This underlines the need for areas to be given more control of the tools to unlock inclusive economic growth in their communities. Ministers have promised a consultation on the shared prosperity fund this year and this is becoming urgent if we are not to be left with a damaging gap between the ending of EU structural funds and the setting up of the shared prosperity fund – a gap which would lead to the closure of vital economic programmes and investments.To be honest, given all Theresa May’s other Brexit worries, what happens to the SPF probably barely registers with her as an issue. We are in a crucial fortnight for the talks process, as Dan Sabbagh explains in our overnight story.Parliament does not return until tomorrow. The SNP is holding its conference in Glasgow. I normally go, but given how much Brexit news is around this morning, it made more sense to stay in London where we will get a briefing from Number 10 later this morning. But I will be keeping an eye on conference proceedings.Here is the agenda for the day.10.30am: Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, speaks at the SNP conference.

I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up, probably between 5pm and 6pm.Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news.

Why is shuteye so important – and what happens if we don’t get enough?“The only known function of sleep is to cure sleepiness,” the Harvard sleep scientist Dr J Allan Hobson once joked. This isn’t quite true, but the questions of why we spend about a third of our lives asleep and what goes on in our head during this time are far from being solved.One big mystery is why sleep emerged as an evolutionary strategy. It must confer powerful benefits to balance out the substantial risks, such as being eaten or missing out on food while lying dormant. The emerging picture from research is that sleep is not a luxury but essential to both physical and mental health. But the complex and erse functions of sleep are only just starting to be uncovered.The brain doesn’t just switch off. It generates two main types of sleep: slow-wave sleep (deep sleep) – SWS – and rapid eye movement (dreaming), or REM.Eight hours is often quoted, but the optimum sleeping time varies between people and at different times of life. In a comprehensive review, in which 18 experts sifted through 320 existing research articles, the US National Sleep Foundation concluded that the ideal amount to sleep is seven to nine hours for adults, and eight to 10 hours for teenagers. Younger children require much more, with newborn babies needing up to 17 hours each day (not always aligned with the parental sleep cycle).However, the experts did not consider quality of sleep or how much was SWS v REM. Some people may survive on less sleep because they sleep well, but below seven hours there was compelling evidence for negative impacts on health. According to experts, too much sleep is also bad, but few people appear to be afflicted by this problem. In the UK the average sleep time is 6.8 hours.In the 1930s, an American scientist Nathaniel Kleitman spent 32 days 42m below ground level in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky. The aim was to investigate the human body clock. Living in complete isolation, with no external cues of night and day, he adopted a 28-hour day. Despite sticking rigidly to a schedule of mealtimes, delivered in a bucket down a shaft, and bedtime, Kleitman failed to adapt and continued to feel awake only when his assigned “daytime” happened to coincide roughly with daytime in the outside world.His body temperature also continued to follow a cycle of close to 24 hours. Many shift workers – particularly those working irregular shifts – face similar problems. In recent years this issue has been taken more seriously, with professional sports teams taking on consultants about schedules for training and travel abroad. The US navy has altered its shift system to align it with the 24-hour clock, rather than the 18-hour day used in the old British system.Over millions of years of evolution, life has become deeply synchronised with the day-night cycle as our planet rotates. So-called circadian rhythms are evident in almost every life-form and are so firmly imprinted on our biological machinery that they continue even in the absence of any external input. Plants kept in a dark cupboard at a stable temperature open and close their leaves as though they can sense the sun without seeing it.In the 1970s, scientists uncovered a crucial piece of machinery for this internal molecular timekeeping. In experiments using fruit flies they found a gene, later given the name “period”, whose activity appeared to reliably rise and fall on a 24-hour cycle. Scientists, two of whom received Nobel prizes last year, later showed that the period gene worked by releasing a protein that built up in cells overnight, before being broken down in the daytime.Later, humans were shown to have the same gene, expressed in a tiny brain area called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This serves as a conduit between the eye’s retina and the brain’s pineal gland, which pumps out the sleep hormone melatonin. So when it gets dark, we get sleepy.The SCN clock is our body’s master timekeeper, but in the past decade, scientists have discovered clock genes are active in almost every cell type in the body, and the activity of roughly half our genes appear to be under circadian control.The activity of blood, liver, kidney and lung cells in a petri dish all rise and fall on a roughly 24-hour cycle, and virtually everything in our body – from the secretion of hormones to the preparation of digestive enzymes in the gut, from changes in blood pressure to body temperature – is influenced in major ways by what time of day these things are normally needed.Just how the ticking of each neuron is linked to the more complex brainwave rhythms that emerge in our brain during sleep is not yet clear, but scientists are investigating. When brain cells are grown in a dish in the lab they begin to self-organise and, somewhat unnervingly, start to show patterns of activity similar to those seen during sleep.Poor sleep is often seen as a modern problem, a blight of sedentary lifestyles and being glued to smartphones late into the night. However, research into the sleep patterns of modern-day hunter gatherers suggests this may paint an overly romantic view of the past. One study, of the Hadza people in northern Tanzania, found frequent night-time waking and widely differing sleep schedules between iniduals. Over a three-week period, there were only 18 minutes when all 33 tribe members were asleep simultaneously. The scientists behind the work concluded that fitful sleep could be an ancient survival mechanism designed to guard against nocturnal threats.The main difference appeared to be that tribe members were unburdened by paranoia and anxiety about sleep problems, which are a common cause of concern in western countries.In extreme cases, sleep deprivation can be fatal. Rats that are completely deprived of sleep die within two or three weeks. This experiment hasn’t been repeated in humans – obviously – but even a day or two of sleep deprivation can cause otherwise healthy people to suffer hallucinations and physical symptoms. After a poor night’s sleep, cognitive abilities take an immediate hit. Concentration and memory are noticeably affected and people are more likely to be impulsive and favour instant gratification over waiting for a better outcome. We are also worse people when we’re tired – one study found that sleep deprived people are more likely to cheat and lie.The reasons for some of these associations are complex and hard to separate from other lifestyle factors. The studies mentioned above attempted to filter out socioeconomic factors, for instance, but factors like stress and social isolation can be harder to capture. That said, there is growing evidence for a direct biological influence. Sleep deprivation has been shown to alter the body’s basic metabolism and the balance between fat and muscle mass.Insomnia has long been known as a common symptom of dementia, but some scientists also believe poor sleep could play a role in causing Alzheimer’s. Research has shown that the brain “cleanses” itself of beta-amyloid proteins linked to Alzheimer’s during sleep and that sleep deprivation causes the levels of these toxins to rise.The answer partly depends on what counts as sleep. Most scientists seem to go with the definition of (a) being immobile and (b) being significantly less responsive than when awake. Based on these criteria, there have been some candidates for sleepless species, but none has been conclusively shown to be true. The bullfrog was an early contender – a 1967 study found the frogs reacted similarly when given electric shocks in the daytime and middle of the night. But doubt has since been cast on this finding. There are animals that require little sleep: the little black bat is thought to sleep for 19 hours each day adult giraffes rarely sleep for more than five minutes at a time. And sleep is not the same for all animals. Dolphins have the ability to put only half their brains to sleep at a time, known as unihemispheric sleep. Migratory birds are thought to sleep-fly and sharks sleep-swim.The House of Sleep, Jonathan CoeOvercoming Insomnia and Sleep Problems, Colin EspieSleepfaring: A Journey Through the Science of Sleep, Jim HorneSleepyhead, Henry Nicholls"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d76c80ba94eac71054b6c8f341845184060f3a58/0_224_6560_3936/master/6560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70b03f5acac00af6bd8dd81b2e28720a","title":"laura muir interview athletics tokyo 2020 olympics","story":"It is a long way from Tooting to Tokyo but, on an autumnal morning in south-west London, Laura Muir can see the path stretching out before her.After her best year as a 1500m runner the road to winning a medal at the Olympic Games seems much clearer to the Scottish veterinarian.In the midst of graduating as a vet earlier this year Muir has won two medals at the world indoor championships, become the European champion and secured the prestigious Diamond League. The world championships in Doha next year will provide a new challenge before Muir attempts to win an Olympic medal, with gold being her target, in Tokyo in 2020.“Obviously the pinnacle is to win the world championships, to win the Olympics,” Muir says as she sits near the finish line at the Tooting Bec athletics track where her dreams of glory are spoken of softly in an understated setting. “I really think I’ve got the potential to do that. It’s going to be very tough but I just want to keep it going.”Last month, having already cruised to the European title, Muir produced the most impressive win of her career in Brussels when she beat three of the four fastest women in the world this year to become Diamond League champion.Having allowed Ethiopia’s Gudaf Tesgay to open up a lead, Muir reeled her in and then, with just over a lap left, she surged ahead and never looked as if she would be caught by a world-class field in a time of 3min 57.85sec.“This year the Europeans was the main focus because you want to win championship medals,” Muir says, “but it felt important to win the Diamond League because it’s kind of a world final. There aren’t any world championships this year so that win was really special. It was a big statement. The time was good but the race slowed for a couple of hundred metres and we lost a second or so. We could have run 3.56.”The 25-year-old Scot ran her personal best of 3min 55.22sec in Paris in 2016. It is the 16th fastest time in history but it is reasonable to wonder how much higher she would climb if the times of athletes who have been subject to doubt about their doping history are set aside. Four of the faster times were set in the Eastern bloc during the cold war when state-sponsored doping was rife. Nine Chinese athletes are in the top 15 and their times in the 1990s were recorded under the infamous coach Ma Junren, though he denies ever employing performance enhancing drugs. Yet most of these runners have never failed a drugs test and they remain in the record books. All Muir can do is run hard and clean and hope that anti-doping measures ensure the world championships and Olympics are drug-free in her event.When Muir finished seventh in the 2016 Olympic final she was openly dubious about the credibility of the winner Genzebe Dibaba. “I have my doubts,” Muir replied when asked if she trusted the new Olympic champion. Dibaba’s coach, Jama Aden, was being held in Spain after the police raided his hotel and discovered various banned substances, including EPO. Aden continues to insist on his innocence and Dibaba has never tested positive and stressed that she was “crystal clean from doping”.Muir said: “You know a tree by the fruit that it bears. If a tree bears sour fruit, then the fruit around it are likely infected.”The case against Aden continues and El País reported recently that the coach could be jailed for four and a half years if he is extradited from Qatar and if found guilty at trial. Muir has not been following the protracted legal case but her rivalry with Dibaba intensified six months ago when, at the World Indoors in Birmingham, she won silver and bronze behind the Olympic champion in the 1500m and 3,000m.Relations between Muir and Dibabe are strained – but has she tried to discuss the situation with the Ethiopian? “There’s never been the opportunity to speak to her. She keeps to herself and doesn’t interact with many athletes.”Muir tries to avoid taking any medication in an attempt to be totally natural and clean. “I can count the number of paracetamol I’ve taken in my life on one hand. I don’t like taking anything. There is medication out there that is perfectly fine to take – like paracetamol – but if something is sore I don’t want to mask it. Yeah, you can take something if your achilles flares up but I like to work through the pain.“Even with protein shakes I take them between the rounds of a championship only because it’s important to recover. During and after training sessions I always just have water and a banana. I don’t have any special shakes. I don’t even drink coffee. I tried it once but it made my heart race.”Muir sounds scrupulous but how often she is tested by anti-doping officials? “Sometimes you can be tested three times a week. Then a month can pass. In Berlin, at the European championships, I was tested when I arrived and then after the race. So it can be multiple times in a few days or once every month. I’m happy to be tested every day of the year but the problem is when you don’t feel those same principles are being applied to everyone else.”Some countries, including Ethiopia, do not allow anti-doping officials entry without prior warning and, as Muir says: “That’s worrying. If you can get a protocol in place for everybody, so everyone’s getting tested equally, it would definitely be the right step.”Muir is admirable in remaining true to herself. She has no wish to create a “brand” or widen commercial opportunities. “It’s a different culture these days, isn’t it,” she says with a shrug. “Everything’s online and people’s appearances are deemed more important. Yeah, I like to dress up and have nice hair and make-up – but there’s a time and a place. I don’t want to be like that 247. I enjoy training and getting muddy and wet, hair all over the place. I don’t want to become something I’m not. I’m just a normal girl from Scotland that likes running.”It seems apt, considering her wholesome character and background as a vet, that Muir should launch the first Simplyhealth Canine Run on 20 October – a 2.5km run for dogs and their owners this month. “It’s great because Simplyhealth have got ties with the veterinarian community and we’re promoting health benefits for dogs and people. As a vet you see lots of overweight pets. Hopefully running with their dogs will spur people to get fit as well.”Muir was a dedicated veterinarian student – so much so that, even when her world indoor championship travel plans were disrupted by severe snow last winter, she kept studying. It needed a £1,500 taxi ride from Glasgow to Birmingham to make it to the worlds but Muir’s studies kept her calm. “I’d been working that morning so I was looking at my notes on the way down and had no time to think about missing the championships. I was just thinking: ‘I’m running today. We’ll get there somehow.’ On Monday morning I was back at school. I couldn’t overthink.”Yet she ran against Dibaba in Birmingham with a more measured tactical approach. At the Rio Olympics, in contrast, she had run the third lap too hard and faded while chasing gold. She seemed much more pragmatic tactically when securing her medals in the world indoors. “I now know you need plans a, b, c and d. Having more experience meant I did really well tactically and a silver and a bronze was really good. But getting my degree was the important thing this year.”Will a complete focus on athletics boost her performances still further? “I don’t really know yet because most years I’d finish my exams in May and then focus on athletics for the summer – and go back to vet school in September. At the moment it feels normal. But, yeah, in the coming months I’ll be training full time. It’s exciting to see what I can do with the extra time.“I’d always wanted to be a vet when I was younger. I never thought about being a professional athlete or winning the Olympics. I never dreamed about it. It was that far from what I thought I could achieve. Now I see it is possible. As Tokyo comes closer I’m very conscious of not letting it consume me. So I’m just going to the Olympics like I’ve always done. Very focused, very relaxed. I know that’s the best way for me to run.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b2446fa7dba4d9b4d96a9b58d74eb14058fe51/0_320_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fc704bc6b292212b74084c295108efd","title":"lewis hamilton f1 world title formula one","story":"Lewis Hamilton insists he will not relax in his pursuit of the Formula One title, despite victory at the Japanese Grand Prix making a fifth world championship a near certainty.The British driver has won five of the last six races held in Austin, so will be targeting victory in the next round in the US, or at the very least in the one after in Mexico, after a superb mid-season gave him a commanding title lead of 67 points.

Hamilton won unexpectedly in Germany and Hungary and then after defeat in Belgium came back with a bravura performance at Monza. He has won all three races since, making it a run of six from seven but despite the advantage he insisted his approach will not change as he closes out the title fight.• If he wins and Vettel is third or lower• If he is second and Vettel is fifth or lower• If he is third and Vettel is seventh or lower• If he is fourth and Vettel is eighth or lower• If he is fifth and Vettel is ninth or lower• If he is sixth and Vettel is 10th or lower• If Hamilton finishes seventh or lower, he cannot win the title in the USA“I am very strict on not being complacent with our position,” he said. “There are 100 points available and I know we have to keep doing the job we are doing now until the last flag.“That is the goal. From past experiences, so much can happen. I will be at the factory this week, and the focus will be on extracting as much as we can from this car because we can always improve.”It is an understandable mental approach from the defending champion who admitted in Japan that he was drawing on youthful experiences familiar to many schoolchildren. “It is a marathon and not a sprint,” he said. “I have been in races when I was a kid doing cross-country and I have just run out of stamina to keep going. We have good stamina this year.”For Vettel and Ferrari, who have shared a series of costly errors and misjudgments this season, it seems clear after Suzuka that the title has gone. Vettel joined the team in 2015 and last year signed a new contract to take him to the end of 2020, unsurprisingly he tried to take the positives from what will likely be his second consecutive runner-up finish behind Hamilton for the Scuderia.“We have great potential in this team,” he said. “The last weeks have been tough for us, overall we could be in a better place and that is for a reason. We know that we have a lot of potential to unleash and we need to work and dig a little deeper. For now we want to prove that the last few races are not what we can deliver.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b62797296784392aa17218970b8754f032d2599b/0_137_4144_2488/master/4144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d4c6b150d7a8acbb969f0fb09c44b73","title":"new york giants odell beckham jr eli manning nfl","story":"Odell Beckham Jr vented his anger, while Sterling started a fight with a trash can. It’s little wonder when an ageing Eli Manning is in declineIs Eli Manning to blame for the New York Giants struggles on offense? Odell Beckham Jr didn’t outright\u0026nbspsay\u0026nbspit, but he strongly hinted at it. \u0026nbspThe star receiver is frustrated. He wants to be featured more prominently in the passing attack, a common complaint from whoever is perceived to be the loudest a receiver in the NFL each year.And he wants to know why he’s not being sent deep where he can take the tops off defenses. There’s a good reason why, of course. Manning no longer possesses the requisite arm strength to connect on such darts down the field. When the signal-caller did find Sterling Shepard on a deep passing play on Sunday, what should have been a sure touchdown was relegated to a 28-yard gain because the third-year wideout was forced to wait for the underthrown ball. The Giants did, however, finally break the 30-point barrier, ending their league-worst streak of 36 consecutive games with 29 points or fewer. But they once again were defeated, this time on a 63-yard field goal by the Carolina Panthers’ Graham Gano as time expired.The 33-31 setback featured a sideline meltdown from Shepard, who let loose with a barrage of punches on a metal bench, followed by a thrashing of the nearest trash receptacle. It was Beckham, no stranger to temper outbursts himself, who tried to soothe Shepard.Just a few hours earlier, OBJ fanned the flames during an interview that aired on ESPN Sunday Countdown, in which he expressed his displeasure with the Giants’ offense and team morale.“I haven’t been in this situation,” said Beckham, who was\u0026nbspaccompanied by rapper Lil Wayne. “I haven’t been in the place where I felt like I could really go out and do everything that I’m capable of doing. I don’t get 20 targets like some other receivers, you know.”It seems Giants coach Pat Shurmur and Manning received the message loud and clear. Beckham was targeted a season-high 14 times on Sunday, and he produced his best game of the campaign: eight receptions for 131 yards and one touchdown. He even passed for one, a 57-yard score to Saquon Barkley. That’s one way for Beckham – who acknowledged he becomes “heated” when he witnesses the success other offenses are enjoying – to ensure the ball travels downfield.Manning, for his part, no longer resembles the steely quarterback who twice outdueled Tom Brady in the Super Bowl. Even though he produced his first 300-yard game of the season on Sunday, Manning was still prone to mistakes with two interceptions. Now 37, his play has sharply declined over the last two seasons.Even when the Giants qualified for the playoffs in 2016, Manning was unable to routinely deliver the ball with zip outside the numbers. Too often, receivers were left to reach back for the ball, with too many precious yards left on the field. The two-time Super Bowl MVP was benched last season by then-coach Ben McAdoo, only for the decision to later be reversed amid public outcry from the passionate Big Blue fan base.Entering the Panthers game, Manning had completed just three of 12 passes that traveled 20 or more yards. The Giants, armed with the No2 pick in April’s draft, had a chance to draft Sam Darnold, but they opted for Barkley, and the USC passer headed to the\u0026nbspother\u0026nbspNew York team.The 21-year-old Darnold has shown glimpses of his talent – and incredible arm strength – through four games with the Jets. The Giants, meanwhile, sit at 1-4 in what looks like a lost season now swirling in controversy and turmoil.“These are the kind of things, in my opinion, when we have the locker room that we have that will help galvanize them because the locker room took care of it, and that is all I’m saying on it. Finito. Done. Let’s talk football, not drama.”The drama isn’t going anywhere, and neither is Beckham. He signed a five-year, $95m extension over the summer that made him the game’s highest-paid receiver. The two-time All-Pro isn’t the problem it’s Manning. And if Giants general manager Dave Gettleman is smart, he’ll fix the problem under center sooner than later.Isaiah Crowell. The New York Jets picked up the running back amid little fanfare on a three-year, $12m deal in March. On Sunday, Crowell ran wild and set a franchise record for yards with 219 yards on just 15 carries in the 34-16 victory over the Denver Broncos. Bilal Powell, his running mate in the Gang Green backfield, also produced a nice day with 99 rushing yards on 20 carries. The Jets broke another record on Sunday, although this one was a little more unfortunate. Marcus Maye intercepted a pass in the Jets endzone and returned it 104 yards, before being tackled on the Broncos one-yard line. That made it the longest interception return in history that hasn’t resulted in a touchdown.200. The number of yards the Tennessee Titans and Buffalo Bills\u0026nbspcombined for\u0026nbspthrough the air. The Bills won the battle of anemic offenses 13-12, but both teams were sluggish. The Titans’ attack – if you can call it that – is averaging just 294 total yards per game (the Los Angeles Rams lead the NFL with 468.4). The Bills are ranked 31 – two behind Tennessee – with a shade over 221 yards compiled per game.OK, maybe it’s not to polite to riff on the Giants’ pain twice in the same week but there was some grand incompetence on show as they conceded this touchdown to the Panthers.“I’ve done this a long time and I’ve never had a game like that. This is uncharted territory ... That type of game has never happened to me. I’m going to evaluate it and chalk it up to an anomaly in life” – Green Bay Packers kicker Mason CrosbyMuch of the kicking in the NFL has been comically bad this season, but Crosby reached a new low in the continuing folly on Sunday. The Packers lost to the rival Detroit Lions, 31-23. The difference? Crosby, who left a total of 13 points on the field in a contest decided by eight points.That’s right, the longtime Packers kicker missed attempts from 41, 38, 42 and 56, plus an extra point – all inside a dome.\u0026nbsp He did connect on a 41-yarder, his lone successful try of the road game.\u0026nbsp–– The Kansas City Chiefs remain undefeated, but this time their defense did the heavy lifting. They harassed Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles all day, registering two sacks, two interceptions and a forced fumble. The unit is still allowing the most yards in the NFL, but if they can continue to pressure quarterbacks, coupled with their own marvelous play under center from Patrick Mahomes, they could be Atlanta-bound come February.–– Baker Mayfield registered his first win as a starter in yet another Cleveland Browns contest that reached overtime. Hue Jackson’s team were 0-2 in the extra period beforehand, but Mayfield was calm on the final drive, with a 13-yard scramble and a 39-yard completion to beat the Baltimore Ravens, 12-9.\u0026nbsp–– The Minnesota Vikings’ Kirk Cousins was electric again, proving that he’s a high-quality starting quarterback. He was the 30 of 37 passing with one touchdown and no interceptions. Of course, he’s aided by the dynamic duo of Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs, but Cousins is delivering the ball right on the money. The Vikes topped the Philadelphia Eagles, 23-21, and at 2-3, the defending Super Bowl champions look shaky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18af07086514f1e9dd4855044f495a241bcb56f5/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfa54d630fddbb2f79e2f9617603fe06","title":"rugby union talking points from weekend action premiership","story":"Joe Cokanasiga will bring bulk to England’s backline and Billy Vunipola does the game a good turnAlready it seems likely Joe Cokanasiga will win his first England cap this autumn and the smart money would be on him doing so against Japan in the third match of the series. He has impressed since his move to Bath and Eddie Jones has been eager to add size to his backline for a while now, taking Cokanasiga on the 2017 summer tour of Argentina. Against Exeter on Friday, Cokanasiga showed how devastating he can be when finishing a second‑half try, albeit ruled out, but the 20-year-old’s inexperience was also exposed by Exeter, particularly for Don Armand’s try. England do not want for wingers but Cokanasiga brings some thing his rivals do not. Gerard MeagherSeeking a third successive Premiership win against Leicester for the second time, Northampton dominated for long periods but lost to two tries in two minutes in the opening half to leave them in the bottom half of the table. They have started Chris Boyd’s reign with two wins and four defeats but were not far away in any of the losses. The New Zealander’s broader vision of the game is slowly taking shape, but wet conditions meant Saturday was a reversion to the old way and Saints were uncomfortable with what used to be familiar. A sign of progress? Paul ReesOspreys took aim at the referee Nigel Owens after their second narrow defeat at the Scarlets this year. “It was a huge penalty count against us and I did not think it should have been 14-3,” the region’s head coach, Allen Clarke, said. “The referee was receiving information from guys either side of the field who have probably never been in a ruck or a maul.”Grenoble’s victory against Bordeaux‑Begles on Saturday left Toulon dangling above the relegation zone, above Agen on points difference, before their match at Montpellier 24 hours later. Their New Zealand wing Julian Savea is still awaiting his first try for the club, a failing his wife, Fatima, last week blames the team’s inability to pass the ball. It was not a problem for Chris Ashton last season.Zebre have sacked their Italy prop Sami Panico after he was arrested following a police search of his house that allegedly uncovered bags of marijuana and hashish in his back garden along with thousands of euros. He is due in court on Monday to face a charge of possessing drugs for the purpose of sale or supply.\u0026nbspPaul\u0026nbspReesWhen Newcastle and Sale met in April it was a thriller contested between two sides with designs on reaching the top four. It will not have gone unnoticed then that they occupy 11th and 12th in the table and played out a pretty torrid match, ultimately won 20-17 by Sale. Both have mitigating circumstances – Sale are missing their big-name players while Newcastle have had an extremely tough run of fixtures – but, as the league has its first break for Europe, the northern optimism that was so prevalent last season has been tempered somewhat. GMWorcester’s director of rugby, Alan Solomons, was quick to stress the Premiership “is a marathon not a sprint” but his Warriors are heading in the right direction. A seven-try romp at Sixways against a lacklustre Bristol has left them on the fringes of the top six after the opening half-dozen fixtures and any prospect of them being relegated this season feels remote. As their former Bristol flanker Marco Mama observed: “We’re an all-court team. We can carry through you or go around you. We don’t just run into brick walls.” The Bears will hope the European break allows Stephen Luatua and George Smith a chance to regain their early-season freshness, with Charles Piutau also due back next month. “We are six games into a 22-round season,” the director of rugby, Pat Lam, said. “We should have won at home against Northampton had we done that we would have been in the top four. We definitely still want to be in the Champions Cup next year but based on this sort of performance we know we are not good enough. We will be judged on that until the next time we front up.” Robert KitsonAre we still talking about this? Danny Cipriani’s exclusion from the England squad has been a talking point for a good 10 years or so and as intensively so as ever in the past few weeks. But when he returns to taunt his old mates with another performance of sheer class it is only right that tongues resume their wagging. His England exile is not quite the scandal people like to make out, such is the class (and age) of Owen Farrell and George Ford, but on this form it remains at the very least contentious. I’d have him in. Discuss. Michael AylwinThe final weekend of the tournament New Zealand had already won was notable for two comebacks. The All Blacks trailed South Africa 30-13 with 19 minutes to go in Pretoria having already lost at home against the Springboks while Australia were 31-7 down against Argentina at the break in Salta and looking doomed to finish bottom of the table, dumping more pressure on their head coach Michael Cheika. In one of their best halves off rugby since the last World Cup, though, they scored five tries to win by 11 points a few hours after New Zealand’s resurrection. The Wallabies will meet their neighbours in Japan at the end of the month before New Zealand face the World Cup hosts ahead of the November series of Tests in Europe. A year ago, South Africa were nondescript but their tour opener at Twickenham now promises to be a Test match, if they come with a full squad.

He had sought assurances from friends, given a number for his fiancee to call if he failed to reappear – and even received an overture to return to Riyadh from Mohammed bin Salman himself.Convinced that he faced no official threat from the powerful crown prince, and feeling pressure from his future father-in-law to get the marriage process rolling, Khashoggi believed the odds were with him.Five days later, the move by the kingdom’s highest-profile dissenter to start a new life may have instead led to his death. Khashoggi has not been heard from since. And with each passing day, Turkish authorities are more convinced that he will never be seen again, his life ended by Saudi agents who had lain in wait, then carried out an act of state-sanctioned murder in the heart of Istanbul.By Sunday night, authorities in Turkey had pieced together a case against Saudi agents that has reverberated through Ankara and Riyadh, placing two regional juggernauts on a diplomatic collision course and underscoring – yet again – the high price of dissent in an era of fast-ebbing freedoms.The allegations against Riyadh are breathtaking. Khashoggi, say Turkish officials, was tortured, then killed and his body smuggled out of the consulate, all under the nose of local agencies. Initially stunned into silence, or curbed by their political masters, officials had initially remained mute as questions about Khashoggi’s disappearance mounted. But at midnight on Saturday, that changed, when a government press officer circulated a news report quoting two Turkish sources who had in turn claimed that Khashoggi was likely dead.Ever since, officials from across the country’s executive and security apparatus have drip-fed information from a still-ongoing investigation. Sources inside the consulate have helped shape understandings, as have hundreds of hours of security and flight logs detailing the comings and goings of a 15-person Saudi security delegation and – according to an ally of Khashoggi – the route taken by a convoy that left the consulate on Tuesday, hours after he had walked through the gate.“They followed the cars, and they know what happened,” said Turan Kışlakçı, the head of the Turkish Arab Media Association, and a friend of Khashoggi. “We have all the details, and he was killed.”According to Kışlakçı, Khashoggi had confided in him in the lead-up to his ill-fated visit. “He said, ‘I’m not afraid, because there is no official investigation against me. On the contrary, recently, Mohammed bin Salman asked me to be his adviser, and I refused, saying this is against my country and region’s interests.’“He said, ‘the most they can do is interrogate me. And I can give them answers, I have nothing to hide.’” His fiancee’s father pressurised him to get the relevant documents to initiate the official marriage process in Turkey. His trusted Saudi friends in the US gave him assurance. He was confident in what he was doing.”The Turkish leader’s position reflects the delicate balance of interests between Ankara and Riyadh, two regional heavyweights who remain at odds on pivotal issues, such as the Saud-led blockade with Qatar, the status of the Muslim Brotherhood and the 2013 military coup in Egypt. Turkey remains resolutely in Doha’s camp on the Qatar standoff, however its officials prefer to direct their enmity at the United Arab Emirates, rather than Riyadh, with which they try to remain on neutral terms.By allowing state functionaries – not elected officials – to out the Saudis over Khashoggi’s vanishing, Turkey has dealt itself a powerful hand, one which Erdoğan fully intends to play in the coming week, as intelligence officials prepare to table their findings.The concessions the leader of a debt-burdened economy could potentially squeeze from a Saudi leader facing allegations that the kingdom’s agents had murdered a foe in a foreign city could be significant. But that would depend on how much the Saudi heir to the throne fears the scrutiny.Less than one year since Prince Mohammed effectively kidnapped the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, after summoning him to Riyadh, Hariri was forced to sign over assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars, as were many of the kingdom’s business and political elite.Since then, Prince Mohammed has pushed ahead with social and economic reforms, but intensified a crackdown on political freedoms. The brash 33-year-old has shown no tolerance for dissent. In the kingdom’s eyes, Khashoggi – through his platform in the Washington Post and access to stakeholders in the US and Europe – was more than a critic: he had become a threat.Saudi denials – and deflection – of any knowledge of Khashoggi’s whereabouts read from a Kremlin playbook, as does his alleged death.Turkey, meanwhile – the world’s most prolific jailer of journalists – now finds itself in the peculiar position of being a champion for a columnist who vanished under its nose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f46d685a38ed1ffb498958d73457d7b9064976/0_191_1395_837/master/1395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a5096bd9cee594f6e248c62984039d7","title":"china accuses detained interpol chief meng hongwei of bribery","story":"Beijing admits it is holding Meng Hongwei, who had been missing since 25 September China has accused the missing ex-Interpol president, Meng Hongwei, of bribery, as the case continues to tarnish Beijing’s image as a rising power and responsible member of international organisations.In a terse statement on Sunday evening, the Chinese authorities admitted they were holding Meng and China’s ministry of public security said on Monday that the Interpol chief, who was reported missing in France at the weekend, was being investigated for accepting bribes.“The inspection and investigation of Meng Hongwei … is very timely, totally right, and very wise,” it said in a statement on its website.Claiming Meng, who is Chinese, “only had himself to blame”, the ministry added: “There is no exception in front of the law. Anyone will be strictly investigated and punished.”French police have been investigating Meng’s disappearance during a visit to China, which was first reported by his wife, Grace, on Friday.In an emotional appeal on Sunday, she told journalists she had not heard from her husband since 25 September when he sent her a WhatsApp message that said: “Wait for my call.”Four minutes later, the message was followed by an emoji of a knife, she said.Then late on Sunday, China’s new anti-corruption body, the national supervision commission, said he was being detained and investigated for suspected “violations of the law”.Also on Sunday, Interpol released a statement saying Meng had resigned “with immediate effect”.Meng, president of the global law enforcement organisation since 2016, usually lives in Lyon, where Interpol is based, with his family.Meng’s case has highlighted China’s opaque system of often arbitrary detentions. In the past few months, the Chinese actor Fan Bingbing vanished from public view before re-emerging with a statement pledging loyalty to the ruling Communist party and apologising for tax evasion. Top officials have also disappeared, re-emerging shamed and under investigation.“Making the president of Interpol suddenly disappear is embarrassing, but China no longer cares about ‘losing face’,” said Zhang Lifan, a historian and independent commentator in Beijing. “I think the authorities knew how big the discussion would be after this incident, but they just don’t care.”Meng’s disappearance and downfall has raised speculation of a renewed political struggle within the Communist party. The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, has overseen a broad corruption crackdown that many see as a political purge.Some observers have pointed to Meng’s connection with now-fallen security tsar Zhou Yongkang. Meng, previously head of China’s bureau of oceanography as well as its coastguard, was promoted to vice-minister of national police under Zhou.Yet Meng’s appointment as Interpol head came after Zhou had been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for bribery and other crimes. Zhang said that showed he was still trusted.As a trade war with the US drags on, there is reported infighting within China’s political elite and it is unclear who Meng may have fallen foul of.“I don’t think the reason behind Meng’s investigation is corruption,” said Zhang. “It’s likely related to a power struggle.”Meng may have foreseen his own downfall. In April, he lost his seat on the decision-making body, the Communist party committee, according to the South China Morning Post. For his wife to give public statements is unusual as relatives of Chinese officials usually remain silent.At a press conference in Lyon, she refused to be photographed, saying she did not want to be identified as she feared for her safety and that of her two children.Meng’s wife and children have been placed under protective custody, according to the French interior ministry.The incident may hurt Beijing’s years-long campaign to put more Chinese nationals in top international posts. Meng’s appointment, the first time a Chinese official has been head of Interpol, was questioned by critics who worried that Beijing would use the organisation to pursue political dissidents and officials who had fled China.But as president of Interpol, a largely symbolic role, Meng would not have had much influence over the “red notice” system.“Meng, like all other Chinese citizens, is required to be loyal to Chinese Communist party first, and must comply with the party’s political demands, including approaches to security that contradict international norms,” said Samantha Hoffman of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. “In Meng’s case, this should have been disqualifying. In other cases, this should at the very least raise serious questions about any senior Chinese Communist party official taking a leadership position at any international institution.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/861ee9836eaf89a3175a25e707e49457ae442cac/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a10ef2ad5b0a22ba86843a1828c1ec34","title":"fernando haddad lula brazil election","story":"Lula’s understudy is running for president, and the support of his jailed patron could prove decisiveWearing a red sweatshirt emblazoned with the image of a Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Fernando Haddad and his entourage piled out of a minibus and marched up the main street of the Rocinha favela, as a band in orange overalls beat out samba rhythms.Haddad, an earnest intellectual, expert in Marxist theory and former mayor of São Paulo, has until 7 October to convince 147 million Brazilian voters he should be their next president – even though one recent poll showed that more than a third of them have no idea who he is.Haddad’s leftwing Workers’ party (PT) is hoping that Lula – who last week dropped his prison-cell bid for re-election – can transfer enough votes to his protege to get him through to a runoff vote on 28 October.Haddad has centered his campaign on a promise to reverse swingeing austerity measures and boost spending to drag the country out of its worst ever recession.“We combine fiscal responsibility with social responsibility,” Haddad, 55, told the . “We are not going to sacrifice the people any more. Without public investment, without families spending, without cheap credit, the economy won’t recover.”But swapping a formidably popular former president for a candidate who many still do not know is not going to be easy.The PT appeared to recognise the scale of the challenge in a recent campaign video, which shows Brazilians struggling to say the candidate’s name before learning to repeat: “Haddad is Lula, Lula is Haddad.”Until this month, when Brazil’s top electoral court barred him from running, Lula was campaigning from behind bars after he was given a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering.Haddad was only confirmed as the PT candidate on 11 September – less than a month before the election he has a lot of ground to cover, and not much time.The latest polls suggest that he is about 10 percentage points behind the far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who is still in hospital after he was stabbed during a campaign event.In Rocinha, some voters had already decided for Haddad. “Of course I will vote for him, my whole family will,” said Regina Carvalho, 55, minding a street stall.“Lula was awesome,” said Antonio Casanova, 37, a motorbike taxi driver. “Many people will vote for whoever he says.”But even in Lula’s home state of Pernambuco, many residents shook their heads when asked to identify his replacement. In Brasíia Teimosa, a heavily pro-PT favela in the city of Recife, Maria do Carmo da Silva, 63 apologised as she struggled to name the party’s candidate – even though a large propaganda sticker of Lula and Haddad adorned her seafront home.Despite knowing nothing of Haddad’s background, Da Silva said she would back him “because he’s from Lula’s party. I’ve seen him on the television promising that he will do what Lula did. I trust him.”Her neighbour, 70-year-old Maria José dos Santos, was also unable to name Lula’s stand-in but agreed. “I can swallow him,” the retired maid said. “But I’d prefer Lula.”Others were less certain. Social worker Luiz Ferreira said he admired Lula for helping the poor even though he believed he was guilty of corruption. “But I’m not voting for Haddad. For starters, I don’t know who he is,” he said.The son of a Lebanese shopkeeper father and teacher mother of Lebanese descent, Haddad and his dentist and academic wife Ana Estela have two children. He graduated in law, before taking a master’s in economics and a doctorate in philosophy at the University of São Paulo.Professor José Álvaro Moisés, who helped judge his thesis on orthodox Marxist theory, described him as “a very serious, competent person”. But he added: “I don’t agree with his theoretical points.”Haddad’s biggest advantage is that his political patron is the most successful politician in the country’s recent history. But it’s also his biggest problem: many Brazilians still love Lula for helping bring 36 million people out of poverty during the country’s boom years – but others despise him for the rampant political corruption and the economic bust that followed.A third of electors say they would vote for whoever Lula recommends. Another third would not vote for Lula under any circumstances.Top PT figures have said Lula would choose all the ministers in a Haddad government – and receive a presidential pardon. Haddad, who is registered as Lula’s lawyer, regularly visits the former president in prison and said he doesn’t want a pardon.“He wants his innocence declared, because he did not commit a crime,” Haddad told the . But he said nothing to clear doubts over Lula’s possible role in a future government. “Why would I stop talking to someone I have known for 20 years, and who I judge to be innocent?” he said.Both men oversaw their party’s manifesto, which promises to overturn austerity measures and privatisations introduced by Michel Temer’s conservative government, and pledges to kickstart a moribund economy with infrastructure works financed by $40bn of Brazil’s international reserves.It also calls for tax cuts for the poor, higher taxes for the rich, increased protections for LGBT people and demarcation of indigenous lands.Haddad said he has been quietly meeting investors spooked by fears that a PT government won’t address Brazil’s huge deficit. “The debt can increase a little in two years then go back to declining,” he said. “Serious people really trust our governments because we already ran the country for 12 years.”Under Lula, the economy surged thanks to a commodity boom which also enabled massive poverty-relief programmes. But under his successor Dilma Rousseff, commodity prices fell and Brazil tumbled into a crippling recession, exacerbated by the impacts of a sprawling corruption scandal, which ensnared top PT figures and their political allies.Fury over corruption propelled Rousseff’s impeachment in 2016 for breaking budget rules. Leftists maintain this was a judicial coup.Plenty of Brazilians feel the case against Lula – a separate scandal involving a seaside apartment allegedly given to him by a construction company – was either concocted to remove him from the race or was simply unfair, given the vast amounts pocketed by other politicians.Yet only the most loyal partisans believe PT protestations that only isolated party figures were involved in what prosecutors described as an institutionalised, multi-party, multibillion-dollar corruption network.On the evening of his Rocinha visit, Haddad faced aggressive questioning on TV Globo’s flagship news programme over PT corruption in general and charges he faces over allegations of illegal donations in his 2012 mayoral campaign.Visibly sweating, Haddad struggled to answer, before racing to a rally in central Rio where speakers angrily accused the TV network of being part of the same rightwing conspiracy that toppled Rousseff.Standing in the crowd, street vendor Wendell de Oliveira, 23, admitted that he was unsure about Haddad, who lacks Lula’s earthy charisma but delivered a powerful, impassioned speech.As the crowd cleared after the rally, a couple danced to Haddad’s folksy campaign song in the light rain, De Oliveira changed his mind. “I would vote for him,” he said.Additional reporting by Tom Phillips in Recife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dff48d8648cf0b93aaed61fd6f19eaa9273442f/949_922_3463_2078/master/3463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3598ba093e570ff6e2002bf120f4446","title":"castellers human towers of catalonia","story":"The 27th Human Tower Competition in Tarragona, Spain.

Photograph: David DaviesPA Wire For middle-class families keen to boost their children’s grades in the State exams, there’s now a new frontier: grinds for parents. The Dublin Academy of Education, a grind school based in the capital, is offering classes on “how to be an A1 parent”.It says parents will learn how to assist and motivate their children to maximise their “confidence, preparation and ultimately their grades in the Leaving Cert exams”.There will also be advice on how to provide a calming study environment and provide a balanced diet for teenagers.Chris Lauder, founder of the Dublin Academy, said the classes are in response to demand from parents who want to know how they can best help their children.“They often feel powerless when it comes to the Leaving Cert and feel they can’t help their children with the subjects because they’re out of touch,” Mr Lauder said.Many, instead, want to learn about ways of inspiring and motivating their children to help reach their full potential, he said.While some accuse grind schools of being “exam factories” and adding to pressure around high-stakes exams, the Dublin academy’s principal, Michael Ruaidhrí Deasy, said the parents’ classes aim to ease exam stress.He said while some “involved” parents may feel they helped their children at Junior Cert level by managing their children’s study, this approach can be counterproductive in the Leaving Cert. “We ask parents to consider themselves as being their child’s number one supporter and cheerleader – rather than manager,” Mr Deasy said.This, he said, involves parents negotiating the boundaries of study and students taking on more responsibility.The parents’ course also seeks to ease conflict at home by helping parents understand the differences between the generations when it comes to study habits.While parents may have been able to study for hours at a time, Mr Deasy said “generation Z” can have a shorter attention  which requires more breaks.They are also more reliant on technology and may genuinely need a phone or computer at times.The courses, which are free and take place this month, come at a time when demand for private grind schools is on the rise.Full-time enrolments at grind schools, which charge more than €7,000 a year, are on the rise.The Institute of Education, one of the largest grind schools, has expanded to two new locations in south and north Dublin.The Dublin Academy of Education, the newest grind school on the market, says it has enrolled 200 full-time students for the current academic year and thousands in evening courses at a new €4.6 million school in Stillorgan. The rise of grind schools has been criticised by equality campaigners, who say they are a way for privileged parents to give their children an advantage.Kathleen Lynch, professor of equality studies at UCD, has said they undermine the equality principle that governs education policy.“Major social and economic inequalities inevitably undermine all but the thinnest forms of equality of opportunity in education because privileged parents will always find ways of advantaging their children in an economically unequal society,” she told an Oireachtas committee earlier this year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3655327.1538980080!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"climate change effects to be far worse than previously thought","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreenpeace activists display a banner during the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) at Songdo Convensia in Incheon on October 8th. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe immediate consequences of climate change are worse than previously thought, according to the world’s leading climatologists.Their warning of heightened risk to the Planet before 2040 is one of the main conclusions in a landmark report on the likelihood of containing global warming to a rise of 1.5 degree increase on pre-industrial levels.Avoiding the likely immediate damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has “no documented historic precedent”, they warn in their report issued by the UN on Monday.Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by mid century would require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”, it adds.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report describes a world of extreme weather events, worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040.There is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 degrees, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.With clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees compared to 2 degrees could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable society, the IPCC said after its report was issued. The half-degree difference could also prevent corals from being completely eradicated and ease pressure on the Arctic, the study finds.It was launched after approval at a meeting of 91 lead authors and government representatives of 195 countries, including Ireland, in Incheon, South Korea.“Scientists might want to write in capital letters, ‘ACT NOW IDIOTS’, but they need to say that with facts and numbers,” said Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace, who was an observer at the negotiations. “And they have.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3655406.1538994185!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what is ireland doing on climate change hint not enough","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSales of electric vehicles including plug-in hybrids are increasing rapidly but from a low level. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe most effective way of addressing climate change is reducing carbon emissions and adopting renewable energy sources. On both fronts Ireland is coming up short.We are out of step with many countries because we are locked into a pattern of rising CO2 emissions notably in transport, agriculture and heating.The UN IPCC “1.5 degree report” shows it’s not too late to reduce the worst effects of global warming – and confirms prompt actions now will minimise the economic costs.Renewable energy: The Irish goal is to achieve 16 per cent renewable energy use by 2020. In spite of generating big amounts of onshore wind, this target will be missed while most EU countries will meet their commitments.Delivery date: Likely by early 2020s – fines will be applied on a yearly basis from 2020 until we meet the target. More demanding targets are being set for 2030.What does this mean? Best case scenario is next year’s budget will have to make allowance for fines of up to €200 million for missing our targets.\u0026nbspThe worst case scenario is the fines could reach up to €600 million, based on current estimates.Power generation: The big success story as far as Ireland is concerned. We are close to achieving 40 per cent electricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2020. With a national grid now able to take a large and wide variety of renewables, there is potential for that to be scaled up to at least 70 per cent.Delivery date: A provisional 2030 target is 60 per cent but 70 per cent is realisable by that date, according to recent analysis.Diversification of energy sources: Critical to Irish energy security and less reliance on fossil fuels is the generation of a wider variety of energy sources (notably solar and offshore wind) and extending interconnector between Ireland and the UK, and with mainland Europe.Delivery date: Solar rollout is likely from early 2020s offshore wind in spite of its immense potential needs an urgent policy overhaul to facilitate quicker delivery. The Celtic Interconnector linking Ireland and France is due by 2025.Heating homes and buildings and energy efficiency: Buildings using fossil fuel boilers account for over 30 per cent of Irish emissions. A hugely costly deep retrofit of housing stock is needed over coming decades. Up to 2 million homes in Ireland need to be refurbished to become as close as possible to “zero carbon”.Delivery date: To be confirmed – 100,000 houses a year are needed to be retrofitted every year for the next 20 years.National Development Plan: €22 billion is committed to climate measures (mitigation and adaptation measures) in the National Development Plan over the coming decade to 2030.Delivery date: Key measures are due to kick in from 2020 – finance is guaranteed but implementation and timelines are unclear.Agriculture: Emissions from agriculture account for a third of Irish emissions and, like transport, are on a rising trajectory. “Smart farming” has been shown to reduce emissions arising from farming. A key policy driver will be a UN land use report coming in August 2019.Delivery date: To be confirmed – emissions are unlikely to peak before 2025 due to major expansion of the sector.Transport: The sale of cars using fossil fuels is to be banned by 2030. Sales of electric vehicles including plug-in hybrids are increasing rapidly but from a low level. The Government plans to have 500,000 electric vehicles on Irish roads by 2030.Delivery date: That target is not realisable based on current uptake and lack of a widespread recharging network.Carbon Tax: The taxing of polluting behaviour in the burning of fossil fuels (petrol, diesel, oil, gas and peat) is currently at a modest €20 per tonne which is insufficient to prompt the widespread adoption of greener fuels and renewable energy needed. There is a likelihood of an increase of up to €10 per tonne in Tuesday’s Budget.Delivery date: The extent of ambition will be revealed within hours.Climate Innovation: The Government has unveiled a €500 million Climate Action Fund with a view to finding innovative solutions. Initial applications have been received which propose radical projects on EV charging infrastructure and developing district heating.Delivery date: To be confirmed.Consumer buy-in: Critical to achieving societal change in moving to a decarbonised world is consumer buy-in, and recognition that transformation in the way we live is needed today not tomorrow.The Citizen’s Assembly has outlined pertinent recommendations which if implemented would mean Ireland could become a world leader in addressing climate change. Politicians have yet to fully take on board its charting of a way forward. A “National Dialogue on Climate Action” has begun with meetings being staged around the country.The impact of a year of extreme weather events has concentrated minds like never before.Delivery date: Needed as soon as possible."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Met \u0026Eacuteireann may issue weather warnings later but says storm, if it arrives, will be shortlivedVideo footage showed woman driving after accident when it was claimed injury prevented her doing so for two monthsTransport, agriculture and heating locked into pattern of rising emissionsTipperary County Council says it is in discussions to try to resolve the problemLawyer says Australia deporting immigrants they believe do not have a \u0026lsquogood character\u0026rsquoMurder investigation under way following incident in house in MacroomLandmark report predicts extreme weather, food shortages and coral die off by 2040Third year of awards celebrating legacy of \u0026lsquo\u0026rsquo science writer Mary MulvihillEoin \u0026Oacute Broin says \u0026euro75m already available, so real figure for scheme is \u0026euro25m a yearDublin Flea Market has failed to find an alternative venue since MayQueues for Krispy Kreme Louis Vuitton sales up \u0026ndash are we throwing caution to the wind?Site earmarked for Traveller accommodation has lain idle due to residents\u0026rsquo objectionsNorthern Secretary meeting politicians in preliminary move to resolve deadlockRestaurant sector critical of VAT rise: \u0026lsquoIt\u0026rsquos a knee-jerk reaction and not Brexit-proofed\u0026rsquoNew scheme pitched at officers with specialist skills that have already left the serviceHiqa has began assessment to examine cost and clinical effectiveness of supplyMary Jane O\u0026rsquoDonovan Rossa was involved in Fenian movement and husband\u0026rsquos releaseThe Dublin university has recovered \u0026euro217,810 in funds that were lost last year"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3655350.1538986190!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"australia deports 630 irish nationals over two year period","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAustralia has replaced the 457 visa programme with the Temporary Skill Shortage Visa (TSS) with a significantly reduced list of qualifying occupations. Photograph: Getty images More than 630 Irish people have been deported from Australia over the last two years according to figures released by the Australian Department of Home Affairs.Overstaying a visa, having a visa cancelled or invalid visas were the most common reasons for their deportation.The Irish Australian Support Association in Queensland (IASAQ), a group that helps Irish people in Australia, said changes to visas had left people in “a grey area” and they were not surprised by the figures.A spokesperson for IASAQ, Paddy Farrelly told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland the changes came as a “shock” and some Irish people in Australia have “fallen between stools”.Earlier this year, Australia scrapped its skilled 457 visa programme, which had allowed tens of thousands of Irish workers to enter the country legally. The visa changes were announced in 2017 by then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull who said he wanted “to put Australians first.”There were allegations that the 457 visa was being misused by employers to import workers “on the cheap” and not to fill genuine skill shortages.The 457 visa was replaced with the Temporary Skill Shortage Visa (TSS), however, the list of occupations that qualify for TSS, was significantly reduced.Mr Farrelly said the transition from the 457 to TSS can be difficult as the new visas are limited, expensive and have an intimidating amount of paper work.He said dozens of people are turning to the Irish Australian Support Group looking for help with visa issues.Melbourne-based Immigration law expert Rick Gunn also told Morning Ireland many people are taking a risk and living undocumented. He said the Australian government was deporting immigrants if they believe they do not have “good character”.Mr Gunn said he recently represented an Irish man held in immigration detention for two months after authorities discovered he did not disclose a minor conviction in Ireland.“The incident was very upsetting for the man and his family.”He urged people to be “upfront and honest” about prior convictions, no matter how minor, when entering Australia.The Irish Australian Support Group urged anyone experiencing visa problems to contact them."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3655501.1538997162!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm callum could be on the way after balmy mid week weather","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHeavy rain and gale-force winds are forecast for Thursday night into Friday morning across the country.

Interpol said on Sunday its general secretariat had received his resignation as president. Photograph: Du YuXinhua via AP The Chinese former head of Interpol, Meng Hongwei, who disappeared last month after a visit to China, is under investigation for accepting bribes, a senior Chinese minister said on Monday.Zhao Kezhi, head of the ministry of public security, issued a statement saying senior officials from the ministry, which is in charge of the police, held a meeting and unanimously agreed to investigate Mr Meng (64). Mr Meng’s wife, Grace Meng, who lives in Lyon where Interpol has its headquarters, reported him missing after she had had no contact with him since September 25th following his departure for China. Her last communication with him was a text message saying “wait for my call” and a knife emoji.Until recent days Mr Meng was president of Interpol, the global law enforcement agency. Interpol said on Sunday its general secretariat had received his resignation.The first official comment on the situation came from China’s national supervisory commission, which said in a brief statement late on Sunday that Mr Meng, a deputy minister of public security in China, was under investigation for a “breach of the law”. The move to detain a high-profile head of an international organisation could prove a setback to Beijing’s efforts to boost its diplomatic standing, suggesting that the charges could be serious.However, the language of the statement from the ministry emphasises Communist Party discipline, which almost certainly indicates that this is being seen as an internal matter. While China’s international reputation is considered important, domestic party issues will always take precedence when it comes to making a decision on who to investigate.“The investigation of Meng is correct and wise. Party members and leading cadres should be honest and show self-discipline and abide by the law. We must strictly abide by the party’s political discipline and political rules,” the statement said, adding that the decision to investigate displayed commitment to the central committee of the Communist Party “with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core” to carry out the wide-ranging anti-corruption campaign that has been one of the hallmarks of the Xi era.He is said to have been close to the disgraced former security chief Zhou Yongkang, a rival of Mr Xi who is now in jail for corruption. This could be a sign that he has fallen foul of faction fighting in the upper echelons of the Communist PartyMr Meng was named president of Interpol in 2016 for a four-year term. Interpol named Kim Jong-yang of South Korea as its acting president."},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

In private he is the kindest and most courteous of men, but his dazzling public ferocity once earned him the reputation of “the rudest man in Britain”. There seems no intention to provoke in his latest utterance – a touching personal reflection on the effects of love and loss on his working life. Yet what he says about bringing a lifetime’s experience to the understanding of history may prove to be more subtly subversive than any of his more teasing obiter dicta. Discussing his latest project – an exhibition about the Tudors at Hever Castle, once the home...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of UK spy agency GCHQ, said that it agreed with those denials from the two companies.Apple and Amazon deny report they were hit by huge Chinese hack“We aware of the media reports but at this stage have no reason to doubt the detailed assessments made by AWS and Apple, an\u0026nbspNCSC\u0026nbspspokesperson said.“The NCSC engages confidentially with security researchers and urges anybody with credible intelligence about these reports to contact us.”The denial came after Apple and Amazon – the two companies named in the report – both emphatically rejected the content of the report. They both said they were unaware of the claims and had undertaken detailed investigations to find any chips and had discovered nothing.Apple even published a special page on its website, under the title What Businessweek got wrong about Apple, that took all of the claims on in detail. It said on that page that there is no truth to these claims, that it never found malicious chips, and that its contacts in law enforcement had not heard of such a case either.As we have previously informed Bloomberg, this is completely untrue, Apple concluded.\u0026nbspApple has never found malicious chips in our servers.Finally, in response to questions we have received from other news organisations since Businessweek published its story, we are not under any kind of gag order or other confidentiality obligations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is their victory and nothing to do with any politicians, despite what they might have you believe\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentUnilever had planned to consolidate its headquarters at its base in RotterdamPoliticians of varying stripes were quick to jump on marmite maker Unilever’s decision to abandon plans to pull its headquarters out of London, and its shares out of the FTSE 100, and no wonder. It’s created quite the froth.\u0026nbspBut let’s be quite clear: This is not their victory, whatever their stripe.\u0026nbspIt is not down to London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Kahn and it has nothing to do with any efforts made by Theresa May’s Tory Government. As for the ramshackle army of gloating Brexiteers? They can belt up too.\u0026nbspUnilever scraps plans to move HQ from London to RotterdamLegal \u0026amp General vows to vote against Unilever’s planned Dutch moveThis was, in point of fact, a battle fought and won through the prosaic virtue\u0026nbspof responsible engagement and activism by big City institutions acting\u0026nbspin the interests of the people who invest with them, which is not something that they always do.\u0026nbspUnilever moving its headquarters out of the UK and abandoning its dual headed Anglo-Dutch corporate structure would have seen it ejected from both the FTSE 100 and the FTSE All Share indices.\u0026nbspThat\u0026nbspwould have forced funds run by the likes Legal \u0026amp General, Standard Life, Aviva and others, to sell up (full disclosure, I have\u0026nbspfunds that track FTSE\u0026nbspindices\u0026nbspand Unilever’s presence within them thus benefits me) because of the rules they operate under.\u0026nbspAs a result, there would have been an awful lot of stock hitting the market in a short time, which would have depressed the selling price. But Unilever’s London exit - a Lexit? - would also have deprived their funds of a high quality, well run, company\u0026nbspa reliable performer with a reliable idend that is\u0026nbspthe sort of hardy perennial every investor needs.\u0026nbspIt was thus very much in the interests of the\u0026nbspclients of London institutions\u0026nbspfor them to say no, and for them to do so publicly, as a number of big fund managers did (but not, sadly, BlackRock, a heavy hitting index\u0026nbsptracker manager).This left Unilever, which needed to secure the support of 75 per cent of its UK shareholders, facing a potentially embarrassing defeat.\u0026nbspIn the City you don’t hold a vote you can’t win if you can help it, so it sensibly withdrew.\u0026nbspNot happily, mind. The statement it issued explaining the decision had\u0026nbspthe feeling of a Scooby Doo style “we’d have got away with it if it weren’t for those meddling kids”.I imagine there will be some strained conversations between a board that robustly defended the plan - “guided by the opportunity to unlock value for our shareholders by creating a stronger, simpler and more competitive Unilever” - and investors over the coming months.\u0026nbspShareholder value was clearly not the sole issue in bringing this forward, however.\u0026nbspForget Brexit. Going Dutch would have made it much harder for the likes of Kraft Foods to come forward with opportunistic, and bad, bids in future because of the regulations in that country. Remember, Unilever only narrowly avoided getting taken out by Kraft last year.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

But they posit that the largest contributory factor is a misallocation of resources, notably the “crowding out” of other industries which causes those industries to wither and die over time.In the UK, the\u0026nbspvast sums of money being created as banking, fund managers and other financial businesses boomed\u0026nbsphas created a brain drain that pulled people from other industries.In the 30 years following Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation of the City in the mid-1980s, financial workers were overpaid by around £280bn, when compared to people of a similar educational background in other jobs, according to the research. Meanwhile, financial services firms reaped an estimated £400bn in excess profits.City of London criticised for giving award to Turkish president’s wifeMcDonnell offers City bosses role in Labour policy makingMay warns EU: Keep City in Brexit trade deal or ‘hurt your economies’Corbyn vows to strip City of London of dominance in British economyBrexit: City of London suffers ‘alarming’ drop in job vacanciesTheresa May says City of London should be ‘optimistic’ about BrexitThese booming profits and salaries pushed up the relative value of the UK’s currency, making manufactured goods and agricultural products more expensive to overseas buyers. Because the price of those goods is set internationally some businesses in those sectors have become less competitive or even unviable.\u0026nbsp“Too much finance” also inflicts the costs of recurrent crises, which the study puts at £1.8 trillion between 1995 and 2015.Professor Andrew Baker, co-author of the report and professorial fellow at the University of Sheffield, said the numbers hint at a “deep underlying problem” caused by the UK’s financial sector.“UK economic strategy in a post-Brexit world needs to make addressing this the central challenge, recognising that where finance is concerned, more can sometimes be less, and less could be more,” he said.John Christensen, a director at the Tax Justice Network who helped develop the framework for the research, witnessed the effects of the “finance curse” in his former role as economic adviser to the island of Jersey.“This new evidence overturns the entrenched orthodoxy that what is good for the City of London must be good for the rest of Britain,” Mr Christensen said.“For decades City interests have been inflicting a finance curse on the UK economy, inflating the exchange rate, slowing growth of the productive sectors, and lobbying governments into deregulating financial services, which led directly to the 2008 banking crisis.\u0026nbsp“UK productivity has fallen dramatically behind most EU member states, and excess household and corporate debt is holding back growth.”Created with Sketch.Biggest business scandals in pictures  Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 Barclays CEO under investigation for trying to identify whistleblower - Monday Paril 10Authorities have launched an investigation into Barclays chief executive officer Jes Staley for trying to identify a whistleblower, the bank said on Monday.221 UK to crack down on bank money laundering after reports of £65bn Russian scam, City minister says -  March 2017The Economic Secretary to the Treasury has vowed that the Government will crack down on money laundering practices, after several of the UK\u0027s biggest banks were accused of processing money from a Russian scam, believed to involve up to $80bn (£65bn).321 Former HBOS bankers convicted of bribery and fraud over £245m loan scam - February 2017Two former HBOS bankers were among six people found guilty of bribery and fraud that cost customers and shareholders hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC reports.421 Former Reckitt Benckiser executive linked to death of 100 people in South Korea jailed for seven years - Friday January 6 A former South Korean executive of UK-based Reckitt Benckiser has been jailed for seven years over the sale of a humidifier disinfectant that killed about 100 people and left hundreds with permanent lung damage.A French court cut the damages owed by rogue trader Jerome Kerviel from €4.9bn (£4.2bn) to just €1m (£860,000). 621 Lloyds chief apologises for damage caused by affair allegations - August 2016 Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has broken his silence over allegations about his private life admitting he regrets any damage done to the group\u0027s reputation.The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, must stand trial in France over a payment of €403 million (now £340m, then £290m) to tycoon Bernard Tapie, a France\u0027s highest appeals court has ruled.821 HSBC senior manager arrested in FX rigging investigation at JFK airport in New York - July 2016A senior executive at HSBC has been arrested at New York\u0027s JFK airport for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to rig currency benchmarks, according to reports.921 Former PwC employees found guilty in \u0027Luxleaks\u0027 tax scandal - June 2016Two ex- PricewaterhouseCoopers staffers were found guilty in Luxembourg of stealing confidential tax files that helped unleash a global scandal over generous fiscal deals for hundreds of international companies.1021 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand.

But you do have an upward revision to the prior month’s increase and there is evidence of some downward effect from the hurricane,” said Matt Luzzetti of Deutsche Bank in New York.“The overall picture is that the labour market remains solid and robust. You have the unemployment rate down to levels last seen in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Wage growth remains consistent with the Fed’s expectations at about 3 percent. Barring any shocks to the economy, we expect them to raise rates in December.”Last month the Federal Reserve raised rates to 2-2.25 per cent, its third hike of 2018 and projections by policymakers signalled one further quarter point rate hike later this year, followed by three in 2019 and another three in 2020.The BLS said the September jobs gains came in professional and business services, health care, transportation and warehousing.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But they posit that the largest contributory factor is a misallocation of resources, notably the “crowding out” of other industries which causes those industries to wither and die over time.In the UK, the\u0026nbspvast sums of money being created as banking, fund managers and other financial businesses boomed\u0026nbsphas created a brain drain that pulled people from other industries.In the 30 years following Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation of the City in the mid-1980s, financial workers were overpaid by around £280bn, when compared to people of a similar educational background in other jobs, according to the research. Meanwhile, financial services firms reaped an estimated £400bn in excess profits.City of London criticised for giving award to Turkish president’s wifeMcDonnell offers City bosses role in Labour policy makingMay warns EU: Keep City in Brexit trade deal or ‘hurt your economies’Corbyn vows to strip City of London of dominance in British economyBrexit: City of London suffers ‘alarming’ drop in job vacanciesTheresa May says City of London should be ‘optimistic’ about BrexitThese booming profits and salaries pushed up the relative value of the UK’s currency, making manufactured goods and agricultural products more expensive to overseas buyers. Because the price of those goods is set internationally some businesses in those sectors have become less competitive or even unviable.\u0026nbsp“Too much finance” also inflicts the costs of recurrent crises, which the study puts at £1.8 trillion between 1995 and 2015.Professor Andrew Baker, co-author of the report and professorial fellow at the University of Sheffield, said the numbers hint at a “deep underlying problem” caused by the UK’s financial sector.“UK economic strategy in a post-Brexit world needs to make addressing this the central challenge, recognising that where finance is concerned, more can sometimes be less, and less could be more,” he said.John Christensen, a director at the Tax Justice Network who helped develop the framework for the research, witnessed the effects of the “finance curse” in his former role as economic adviser to the island of Jersey.“This new evidence overturns the entrenched orthodoxy that what is good for the City of London must be good for the rest of Britain,” Mr Christensen said.“For decades City interests have been inflicting a finance curse on the UK economy, inflating the exchange rate, slowing growth of the productive sectors, and lobbying governments into deregulating financial services, which led directly to the 2008 banking crisis.\u0026nbsp“UK productivity has fallen dramatically behind most EU member states, and excess household and corporate debt is holding back growth.”Created with Sketch.Biggest business scandals in pictures  Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 Barclays CEO under investigation for trying to identify whistleblower - Monday Paril 10Authorities have launched an investigation into Barclays chief executive officer Jes Staley for trying to identify a whistleblower, the bank said on Monday.221 UK to crack down on bank money laundering after reports of £65bn Russian scam, City minister says -  March 2017The Economic Secretary to the Treasury has vowed that the Government will crack down on money laundering practices, after several of the UK\u0027s biggest banks were accused of processing money from a Russian scam, believed to involve up to $80bn (£65bn).321 Former HBOS bankers convicted of bribery and fraud over £245m loan scam - February 2017Two former HBOS bankers were among six people found guilty of bribery and fraud that cost customers and shareholders hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC reports.421 Former Reckitt Benckiser executive linked to death of 100 people in South Korea jailed for seven years - Friday January 6 A former South Korean executive of UK-based Reckitt Benckiser has been jailed for seven years over the sale of a humidifier disinfectant that killed about 100 people and left hundreds with permanent lung damage.A French court cut the damages owed by rogue trader Jerome Kerviel from €4.9bn (£4.2bn) to just €1m (£860,000). 621 Lloyds chief apologises for damage caused by affair allegations - August 2016 Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has broken his silence over allegations about his private life admitting he regrets any damage done to the group\u0027s reputation.The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, must stand trial in France over a payment of €403 million (now £340m, then £290m) to tycoon Bernard Tapie, a France\u0027s highest appeals court has ruled.821 HSBC senior manager arrested in FX rigging investigation at JFK airport in New York - July 2016A senior executive at HSBC has been arrested at New York\u0027s JFK airport for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to rig currency benchmarks, according to reports.921 Former PwC employees found guilty in \u0027Luxleaks\u0027 tax scandal - June 2016Two ex- PricewaterhouseCoopers staffers were found guilty in Luxembourg of stealing confidential tax files that helped unleash a global scandal over generous fiscal deals for hundreds of international companies.1021 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand.

June 22, 2017It\u0027s strange to think, but Kendrick Lamar hasn\u0027t actually appeared at Glastonbury Festival before. This year he topped the Coachella bill and also appeared as a headliner at Reading \u0026amp Leeds, so he\u0027s no stranger to festivals. Glastonbury seems as though it\u0027d be a great fit for the hip hop star, but perhaps he\u0027ll be too busy working on a follow-up to 2017\u0027s acclaimed album,\u0026nbspDAMN.\u0026nbspThe Australian pop star recently said she would love to get a headline slot, after she was forced to pull out in 2005 to undergo treatment for breast cancer.\u0026nbspI think I would have been the first solo female to headline in however many years it was, so I was really proud of that at the time, she told the\u0026nbspPress Association.\u0026nbspObviously it didn\u0027t happen. So yes, it would be amazing and very emotional to be standing there and doing what I didn\u0027t get to do all those years ago, for sure.Michael Eavis has been after Fleetwood Mac for years, but said in 2016 that unfortunately he just couldn\u0027t afford what its members were asking for.\u0026nbspAdele did it for less, Rolling Stones did it for a reasonable rate, he said. We can\u0027t afford to spend £4-5m on people to play. Mick Fleetwood said he would do it himself, but come on. I\u0027d like the rest of the band and they all want to be paid a lot of money.Emily Eavis says one Glastonbury 2019 headliner is already bookedMick Fleetwood talks Lindsey Buckingham ahead of Fleetwood Mac tourA brief history of Fleetwood Mac\u0027s ever-changing lineupHe then suggested in 2017 that Stevie Nicks as a solo performance would be a good alternative: Maybe I could get her on her own.However, things may be looking up – despite the band\u0027s split from Lindsey Buckingham,\u0026nbspFleetwood Mac recently announced tour dates for 2019. Mick Fleetwood also teased an appearance last year, suggesting: One day we\u0027ll just get on a plane and come over and do it.The pop megastar\u0027s\u0026nbspReputation\u0026nbspworld tour runs until the end of 2018 with a closing date at the Tokyo Dome in Japan, but there\u0027s\u0026nbspscope for it to continue beyond that if Swift decides to return to Europe next summer.Her close friend and fellow pop star Ed Sheeran, who headlined last year,\u0026nbspsuggested she may not be keen on a Glastonbury slot because she doesn\u0027t like festivals. However, given the success of her headline appearance at the BBC\u0027s Biggest Weekend festival in Swansea – dubbed the Glastonbury replacement for 2018 – perhaps she\u0027ll reconsider. There\u0027s no doubt whatsoever that she\u0027d put on an amazing pop spectacle – earlier this year\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspgave her opening\u0026nbspReputation\u0026nbspshow in Manchester five stars\u0026nbspand called it the biggest event on the 2018 pop calendar.\u0026nbspOne person who might convince Swift to appear at Glastonbury is another rumoured performer: Sir Paul McCartney. The Beatles legend recently revealed that one of the songs on his new album\u0026nbspEgypt Station\u0026nbspwas inspired by Swift and her positive anti-bullying messages to fans.\u0026nbspI was actually thinking about Taylor Swift and her relationship to her young fans and how it\u0027s sort of a sisterly thing, he told the BBC of his song Who Cares. I was imagining talking to one of these young fans and saying: \u0027Have you ever been bullied? Did you get bullied?\u0027Then I say: \u0027Who cares about the idiots? Who cares about all this? Who cares about you? Well... I do.Paul McCartney reveals advice he\u0027d give himself after Beatles splitPaul McCartney: What makes the most successful pop star keep writing?Asked by Jo Whiley about the potential of Macca getting his own headline set, Michael Eavis\u0026nbspsaid: Oh we always want him – he\u0027s top of our list. We\u0027ll have to see. He last headlined in 2004, and with his 17th\u0026nbspsolo album\u0026nbspEgypt Station\u0026nbspnow released and topping the charts in the US, a Worthy Farm visit doesn\u0027t sound completely beyond the realms of possibility.\u0026nbspIt wouldn\u0027t really be Glastonbury without another Oasis reunion rumour flaring\u0026nbspup, as unlikely as it still appears to be. However, with both the Gallagher brothers releasing solo albums this year, perhaps the festival will find space for both of them. Although it\u0027s probably safer to keep them on separate stages.\u0026nbspThe grime king released his debut album Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer\u0026nbspin 2017, receiving critical acclaim and a spot on the Mercury Prize shortlist. He also delivered an\u0026nbspincendiary performance at the Brit awards.\u0026nbspConsidering he is one of the hardest-working people in the music industry, no one could say Stormzy\u0026nbspdoesn\u0027t deserve a spot on the Pyramid Stage.\u0026nbspIt was Stormzy himself who sparked the rumours of his potential Glastonbury headline slot, after he shared a cryptic Instagram story which showed a quote by Noel Gallagher on previous Glasto headliner Jay Z: No, I\u0027m not havin\u0027 hip hop and Glastonbury. F***in\u0027 no chance.The comment is a slight mis-quote from the former Oasis star who was asked how he felt about Jay Z\u0027s watershed moment at the festival\u0026nbspin 2008.Sweden holds world\u0027s first major \u0027women only\u0027 music festival Stormzy has launched a Cambridge scholarship for black studentsStormzy announces #Merky Books imprint with Penguin Random HouseIf it ain\u0027t broke, don\u0027t fix it, Noel said. If you start to break it then people aren\u0027t going to go. I\u0027m sorry, but Jay Z? no chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music and even when they throw the odd curveball in on a Sunday night you go \u0027Kylie Minogue?\u0027 I don\u0027t know about it. But I\u0027m not having hip hop at Glastonbury. It\u0027s wrong.Festival organiser Emily Eavis contradicted Noel earlier this year, explaining that genre was irrelevant when it comes to booking a good act.It\u0027s about who is going to produce the most exciting show and is making the best music, she said. We always encounter debate, which is great, that\u0027s what it\u0027s all about. Most music fans are open minded and many discover new music by coming to festivals and getting blown away by some amazing artists that they\u0027ve never seen before.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And figures himself as trying to create a bigger blip on the long timeline, whereas a lot of the people will be stuck in a very small space of where their art reaches, or where their thoughts reach, after they’ve died.”Kanye has been using every platform he has to warn against, as he sees it, the homogenisation of black thought, although he recently deleted his Twitter and Instagram accounts (again).\u0026nbsp“Black people don’t have to be Democrats,” he tweeted in April, which Chance retweeted and later apologised for.Kanye West goes on political rant about Democrats after Saturday Night Live performanceSNL’s Pete Davidson criticises Kanye West’s rant on showChance, who is currently working with Kanye on a new album entitled Good Ass Job, didn’t endorse his producer’s behaviour however.“I think he does a lot of stuff for the attention of the masses, to get that stuff documented and made into history, but I think also a lot of times the attention that he may be seeking is at the immediate detriment of some people that may need the attention more, he said.Budden asked him: “Do you have those conversations?” To which Chance replied: “Hell yeah...Definitely in these past few weeks since he’s been back in Chicago, that’s what it is: hard conversations.”Over the weekend, Saturday Night Live cast member Pete Davidson criticised Kanye’s post-filming political speech, stating that being mentally ill is not an excuse to act like a jackass.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Andy Martin says it’s time to revive the sound of silenceClick to followThe IndependentI’m sitting in my local library, in Church Street, London. Trying to concentrate, the way you do. There are people reading and writing, and taking books off shelves, and reading the newspaper. There are also two people, one man and one woman, making telephone calls. I imagine it’s a WhatsApp call or Skype, via the library’s decent wifi setup. The guy is keeping his voice down a bit (some kind of business deal), the woman, if anything, is speaking louder than normal. She is upset. Something about how she has thrown her partner out of the house for excessive drinking or something. Either way, it’s a sad tale.\u0026nbspBut what I really want to know is this: whatever happened to those signs in libraries that said,\u0026nbsp“SILENCE PLEASE”, or “SILENCE MEANS SILENCE”? When did libraries become silence-free zones? The telephone callers come in here specifically to shoot the breeze. The library has become a mecca for mobile phone users who can’t get a decent signal in the street.I was recently on a train journey from London to Bristol. An hour or two. I had reserved a seat in the “Quiet Carriage”. A train is not a library (although that’s not a bad idea). But it seems reasonable to have at least one compartment dedicated to people who want to keep it down for a while. There are polite notices (that not everybody reads) asking passengers to refrain from (as per the library) making telephone calls. But what about loud conversations? Is there a protocol about that? Two women, sitting opposite one another, keep up their dialogue, punctuated by laughter, all the way to Bristol. Maybe they really are old friends who haven’t seen one another for years. But I get the feeling that, overt content aside, everything they say is a protest, a revolt against oppressive peace and quiet.‘Africa’ by Toto to be played at Bristol music venue for entire nightYou will often find me walking down the street (or, indeed, sitting in libraries or in quiet carriages) wearing a pair of headphones – the big ones that go right over your ears. And you are welcome to tap me on the shoulder and say:\u0026nbsp“Aren’t you that curmudgeon who goes about complaining about noise and yet here you are with headphones on, listening to music. Isn’t there some kind of contradiction here, verging on hypocrisy?” (or words to that effect). And I might reply to you – perhaps wordlessly – by removing the headphones and inviting you to listen to… the sound of silence. I am wearing the headphones to keep the music out.\u0026nbspBut in any case, even if I were listening to that old song by Simon and Garfunkel (now to be heard in a rather louder version by a band called Disturbed), there is a big difference between consensual listening and the non-consensual kind. Take, for example, my local gym. Again, the gym is not a library or a quiet carriage. You expect to hear a certain amount of grunting and groaning and huffing and puffing, not to mention the chugging of X-trainers and rowing machines and the clang of weights hitting the floor. But do I have to listen to yet another droopy Ed Sheeran tune as well? In fact most of the “songs” at the gym are not songs at all but rather extended disco programmes consisting of some endlessly repeated electronic pulse. Like static, but too irregular to count as white noise.Even in the post-industrial landscape we still seek out the solitude of far-flung spaces, the forest or the desert or the mountainI went to the trouble of writing to the higher powers at the gym to register dismay at this aural fodder and trying to get them to change their playlist, but was told that the “music” is bought in as a package from some anonymous provider, so can’t be modified, and is deemed to be suitable for the purpose of exercising anyway. Someone is paying for this garbage? I’d pay not to have to listen to it.Does life need a perpetual soundtrack, as if it were a movie, with a theme tune denoting sharks or flying saucers or romance? Or commentary, as if it were the Big Match or the Big Fight? We are living through an age of maximum noise, which has driven me into the arms of a new book, A History of Silence, by the French historian Alain Corbin, who has also written marvellous histories of bells, beaches\u0026nbspand smells (and even a history of the weather). Books used to be largely audio. Since there\u0026nbspweren’t too many copies around (and there weren’t too many people capable of reading them), they would be read out loud to the assembled throng. It’s only in the era since Gutenberg and Caxton that the text has become the accessory of quiet contemplation, the opportunity for a silent conversation going on in your head, and Shakespeare can write:\u0026nbsp“Come and take choice of all my library and so beguile thy sorrow.” A History of Silence is definitely beguiling, like an oasis of tranquility amid the maelstrom.My father, I recall, was close enough to a bomb exploding to lose 50 per cent of his hearing. But I want to set aside acts of war and concentrate on what, for want of a better term, we can call acts of peace. Probably the least peaceful environment I’ve ever been exposed to is a metalworking factory. My job was to feed and clean out the machines. Which kept on ceaselessly stamping out nuts and bolts. Maybe they provide ear-protectors these days, but then you were on your own. It was the aural equivalent of hell, the dark but also ear-splitting satanic mills, where you can’t hear yourself think. I didn’t last too long in that cacophonic job, mainly because I thought it was going to inflict lasting cerebral damage, like getting in the ring with a heavyweight for punishing round after round. They worry about footballers heading the ball, but what if the ball is pounding into your head all day long?\u0026nbspAnd talking of headbanging, isn’t this the point of the typical rock concert? Was it on the Isle of Wight or that one in Suffolk –\u0026nbspLatitude Festival – where I found myself rammed up against one of the loudspeakers? My brain is still reeling too much from the experience to recall exactly. It seems ironic that even musicians need to wear earplugs. Probably didn’t happen to JS\u0026nbspBach. I know Beethoven went deaf, but probably not as the result of an over-amplified pianoforte. \u0026nbspI still don’t understand how Stephen King (according to his book\u0026nbspOn Writing) can write while listening to loud rock music (Metallica is one of his go-to bands). Or maybe it explains why Jack Nicholson can’t wait to pick up an axe in The Shining. Conversely,\u0026nbspProust needed the cork-lined bedroom to write in and even bribed builders working on the apartment above to stop work so he could finish a sentence.\u0026nbspA silent retreat would test me to breaking point. Language is as indispensable to the mental as water is to the physical. In the beginning was the wordThe rise of the Romantic sublime, with its adulation of the pastoral, was in part a counterpoint to the rise of industrial capitalism. Wandering lonely as a cloud tended to take you well away from the madding crowd and into the verdant wood to listen to the birdsong. When Wordsworth does stand on Westminster Bridge and look out over London (back in 1802), he makes sure it’s first thing, before everyone is up and around and making a racket: “This City now doth, like a garment, wearThe beauty of the morning silent, bareShips, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lieOpen unto the fields, and to the skyAll bright and glittering in the smokeless air.”Even in the post-industrial landscape, where the clatter and clamour of factories has given way to the constant chatter of mobile phones and annoying ringtones, we still seek out the solitude of far-flung spaces, the forest or the desert or the mountain. We want to get off the grid for a change. Switch off all the notifications. Leave an “on vacation” message on email. It’s like those telescopes that are installed on top of remote island peaks or in the Atacama desert\u0026nbspto get away from all the artificial light. You’re not excluding light altogether, you’re just trying to focus on a point. So too we seek to escape the noise with some notion of getting a clearer signal from the great beyond. I imagine even GCHQ surveillance wallahs eventually take the headphones off and stop listening in to all those myriad conversations taking place every minute of the day, clandestine or not.Considering the history of the universe, the Big Bang was actually the most peaceful event ever (and here I have to depart from Alain Corbin’s last-page shoutout to the “noise” of the Big Bang) because there was as yet no medium for conveying sound. Nor was there anyone around to lend an ear anyway. As the tagline of Alien used to says:\u0026nbsp“In space, no one can hear you scream”.\u0026nbspWomen driven to suicidal thoughts over ‘callous’ pension age changeHow a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityThere is a case for the music of the spheres. The whole of time and space is vibrating with gravitational waves, which are audible, so in this sense silence is an illusion. But noise is more of a human speciality, and the desire for serenity has risen alongside it. I just heard on the radio – maybe I should have turned it off? – Nicky Campbell denouncing as “pathetic… mollycoddling” the decision by Manchester University students to ban clapping and whooping, but I get that. It’s akin to mystics going off into the wilderness in their quest for the ine. They haven’t banned beer yet.I have a talkative friend who has joined a Talkaholics Anonymous group. I guess she’s getting on pretty well because I haven’t heard from her for a long time. The recurrent catchphrase of Lee Child’s novels, “Reacher said nothing”, is a mute testimony to our sense that, at a certain point, you have to turn off the tap and call a halt to the wisecracks and witticisms and Boris-Johnsonian bluster and speechifying.\u0026nbspBut I understand the fear of silence. “The rest is silence.” It’s the tragic end of Act 5. It feels like RIP. Silence is spooky. Even the deeply contemplative Pascal, who prided himself on being able to remain at rest in a room, could look up into the night sky and fear “the eternal silence of these infinite spaces”. I couldn’t sign up as a Trappist monk. Even going off on one of those silent retreats would test me to breaking point. How long could I stand it? Language is as indispensable to the mental as water is to the physical. In the beginning was the word.I can think of one guy who regularly used to lapse into silence, sometimes for days on end, as an alternative to the blazing row. I don’t blame his wife for leaving him. Coercive silence can sometimes be as much of an assault on the person as too many decibels.But there has to be scope for voluntary and consensual silence. Nietzsche once defined marriage as “a long conversation”, which is fine, but there have to be times (curled up in front of the fire, walking down the street arm in arm) when the conversation stops and silence descends like grace, as soundless as snow falling. Silence (whisper it) is the language of love. Or as Wittgenstein so neatly put it:\u0026nbsp“Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child\u0026nbspand the Making of Make Me’. He teaches at Cambridge University.

But calls and texts will simply not come through.The easiest way to check whether any O2 phone is affected is to try and call another number. If that handset is affected then it will simply fail to connect.The issue was confirmed on phones in\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s office. But some other handsets, right next to them, appeared to be working absolutely fine.Instagram stops working and refuses to load picturesHey @O2 your network is down in Old Trafford, he wrote on Twitter.\u0026nbspNot a surprise normally but it’s not match day!O2 said it was aware of the problem and that it had been fixed, but that the problems might continue as people\u0027s phones settle back onto the network.Some customers may have experienced an issue when using their mobile earlier today, a spokesperson said. This was fixed within 40 minutes. Some customers may continue to experience some intermittent issues when reconnecting to the network. We’re investigating what happened and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.The outage came at the same time as O2 announced a new service, known as Popcorn Pass, which will give eligible customers 40 per cent off cinema tickts for two years. Anyone buying its more expensive sim-only or handset deals will get access to the new membership.It also followed a major outage at Instagram, which left users unable to load their feeds or see pictures on the app.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

their positions handed to European partnersClick to followThe IndependentProfessor Peter Coveney is concerned about the fate of medical research in the country following BrexitA top British scientist has called the government “totally chaotic” as he stands to lose\u0026nbsphis leadership of major European projects after Brexit.\u0026nbspProfessor Peter Coveney heads up three EU projects with a total value of around £15m, and he says work like his will be compromised if a deal is not agreed before March.His research, which aims to create a “forecasting system” that predicts disease, involves scientists working across Europe but is led from University College London.A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science communityWhile the government said\u0026nbspit will fund British scientists participating in European projects if they lose out on money post-Brexit, it has not promised to support entire projects with UK scientists at the helm.The EU currently hands British project leaders millions of euros to distribute among their partners, but it will not do this if the UK is relegated to a so-called “third country” after Brexit.“The big thing that is unclear is that there is no agreement from the government here to continue to support projects that are led by the UK,” said Professor Coveney.“So leadership of projects – big ones that are influential – is thrown completely into disarray.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor

participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchDescribed by Professor Coveney as the “medical equivalent of weather forecasting”, his work uses supercomputers to simulate human bodies and plan people’s medical treatments and surgeries in advance.Due to limited British capacity to undertake such projects, he said this kind of research is totally dependent on European collaboration.His criticism comes after Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTV particle physicist Professor Brian Cox voiced their concerns about the impact of Brexit – particularly a no-deal outcome – on British science.Many leading scientists, including two Nobel prize winners, have backed The Independent‘s campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit vote.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteThe UK is currently positioned as a European leader, home to many of the EU’s most prestigious research institutions and receiving 15 per cent of the funding from the flagship European funding programme Horizon 2020.However, this status will be threatened if the nation’s top scientists are forced to hand over the reins of their research to partners.Such an outcome now seems likely, as the government expects the UK to become a third country without a deal, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit now looks more plausible than ever before.He wants reassurances that his projects and the livelihoods of lab members who are paid with this funding are not jeopardised.Professor Coveney contacted Mr Gyimah to voice his concerns, and received an assurance that the government was “seeking discussion” with the European Commission concerning a no-deal scenario.“This would need to include projects where the UK participant is responsible for coordinating funding,” Mr Gyimah wrote.Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealDismissing this response as “merely regurgitating” information from the government’s official no-deal planning documents “that was unhelpful in the first place”, Professor Coveney said he needs the government to guarantee it will replace any lost funding in its entirety. He has laid out his case in a blog post for the campaign group Scientists for EU.“The picture is as follows: if you were to be a third country following midnight on 29\u0026nbspMarch and you wanted to continue to run these big projects, it would be incumbent on you to fund the entire thing,” he said.This would mean committing to funding not only the British scientist in charge of the project, but also the international team working with them.Despite the expense, he said this was a price worth paying to maintain UK leadership in science and protect the health of its citizens by funding medical research.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But you do have an upward revision to the prior month’s increase and there is evidence of some downward effect from the hurricane,” said Matt Luzzetti of Deutsche Bank in New York.“The overall picture is that the labour market remains solid and robust. You have the unemployment rate down to levels last seen in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Wage growth remains consistent with the Fed’s expectations at about 3 percent. Barring any shocks to the economy, we expect them to raise rates in December.”Last month the Federal Reserve raised rates to 2-2.25 per cent, its third hike of 2018 and projections by policymakers signalled one further quarter point rate hike later this year, followed by three in 2019 and another three in 2020.The BLS said the September jobs gains came in professional and business services, health care, transportation and warehousing.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

His disappearance has roiled the Arab world, and threatened to create fresh diplomatic troubles for the Saudi kingdom, under the sway of its ambitious crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.\u0026nbsp“I still have good expectations.

Turkish officials and those briefed on the matter said Saturday night they feared that Mr Khashoggi had been killed and his body removed based on circumstantial evidence collected via closed-circuit television cameras positioned around the consulate.\u0026nbspSaudi Arabian\u0026nbspofficials have strongly denied that any harm has come to Mr Khashoggi at their hands, insisting he left the consulate on Tuesday shortly after entering. The consul general has allowed Turkish authorities as well as a Reuters correspondent to examine the facility.\u0026nbspTurkey and Saudi Arabia already find themselves on opposite sides of several major regional issues, including Ankara’s strong partnership with Qatar, which Riyadh bitterly opposes. Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance could further exacerbate relations, though neither side has an interest in escalating.

No-one wants a hard border but solutions have to be found and are out there, as the ERG has already outlined.Separately, former Brexit Minister David Jones said the PM must stick to her red lines and rule out membership of a customs union, telling the Sun: We must not be dancing to the tune of the EU.Meanwhile, some Tory Brexiteers are ready to flex their muscles in key non-Brexit parliamentary votes if Mrs May seeks to force a Chequers-type deal through the Commons with Labour support.Senior MP Sir Bernard Jenkin messaged a group of fellow Tories: Make no mistake a softnon Brexit pushed by the Conservative establishment but put through with Labour support will look like we are abandoning our supporters and remove any sense of obligation among Conservative-Brexit supporting MPs to continue to support the Government.Brexit news: Brexiteers are urging Theresa May to toughen her negotiating stance (Image: )Sir Bernard denied he was suggesting that he or any Conservative MP would do something as drastic as voting against the Government\u0027s October 29 Budget.But another rebel said: She (Theresa may) hasn\u0027t got a majority and by God, she\u0027s going to be shown she hasn\u0027t got a majority.Others have privately warned party whips not to rely on their support in votes but play down speculation about an organised Brexiteer plot to disrupt government business.Looking ahead to next week\u0027s EU summit, a Downing Street source said: We have always said we are working hard for a deal this autumn. However, there remain big issues to work through, and as the Prime Minister has said this will require movement on the EU side.Former head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove, a known Brexit backer, told Sky News he was still happy to see Britain leave the bloc.I see it as an issue of sovereignty ...

Brexit \u0027INGENIOUS PLAN\u0027: Whips trying to FORCE Labour to back Chequers                \u0027Abandon customs union by 2022 or risk BOTCHED Brexit\u0026rsquo say Brexiteers There has been a surge in interest from companies looking for new routes into the UK amid concerns that Dover could become gridlocked.Associated British Ports (ABP) has announced a \u0026pound36million investment in its container terminal at Immingham, having spent \u0026pound14million in Hull last year.Higher capacity would bring a huge influx of jobs to Immingham, which is well placed as more than half the cargo entering Britain via the south coast is destined for the North.Relaxed As well as ABP\u0027s proposed expansion, shipping line DFDS has increased its Immingham operation by 10 per cent in anticipation of the Brexit effect.Immingham and neighbouring docks want to become free ports, avoiding tax and duties currently being levied by Brussels.A cross-party group of MPs has been formed to fight for free port status, demanding that imports and exports should take place without trade barriers.The port of Immingham is looking forward to a post-Brexit boom (Image: Glen Minikin)Chairman and Cleethorpes Conservative MP Martin Vickers said: I am very relaxed about whether we get a deal in the Brexit negotiations, because whatever the outcome I feel certain this area can thrive.Free ports are not just a vehicle to boost the national economy.They will be a great boost to coastal communities, some of which are badly in need of regeneration.The Humber in past years has been somewhat left behind. But now there is so much to be positive about and we must capitalise on the potential trade possibilities that Brexit is throwing up. We are seeing real opportunities and there is good cause for a new feeling of optimism.Anne Tate, northern Lincolnshire manager for the Hull and Humber Chamber of Commerce, said: A hard Brexit would certainly have the potential to help this area. We welcome any expansion of trade through Immingham and have the transport infrastructure to keep up with increased demand.Local worker Jo Macfarlane believes the local economy is booming (Image: Glen Minikin)Increased trade through the port would reverberate through other local contract industries and assist not only the logistics sector but also many other supply industries.Jo Macfarlane, 52, who works at the independent clothing store Lou Lou\u0027s Muse in the centre of town, said: Things are moving in the right direction, there\u0027s a buzz about the place. Two major new shops have opened and there\u0027s a better, more positive atmosphere in town.More traffic through the docks is good news for me and my husband because he\u0027s a truck driver.It\u0027s good for business here too because it\u0027ll mean more jobs and more people spending.On a run-down terrace on Queens Road, which twists towards the docks\u0027 southern entry point, new businesses are opening to take advantage of passing trade. Steven Scriver, 63, works for coach operator Sherwood Travel. He said: I voted to leave because millions were going to Brussels when areas like this were declining.Only two or three weeks ago the old loco depot was demolished. It was built when this area was thriving and transporting coal to power stations and oil from the refineries. It\u0027s great news to see some growth and investment in the docks again. This is what we hoped and expected when we voted to leave the EU in the first place and now we\u0027re about to see it happening.

Brit troops were caught in a shooting galleryPosted overseas, Pop spent some time guarding the Empire in India before being transferred to Africa where his regiment served in both Sierra Leone and the bloody Boer War in South Africa.He was eventually discharged on histo England in . But following the outbreak of World War One, Kennedy immediately re-enlisted, leading men as a sergeant in  Battalionin their preparations.By July , the battalion had received the order to sail to the Aegean Sea to take on the Turks, who had sided with Germany.They headed for the peninsula of Gallipoli — a key Ottoman Empire stronghold — and straight into one of the greatest disasters in British ­military history.Exhausted by the beach landings at Suvla and being forced to march over rough ground in darkness for miles without water, Kennedy and his men in  Battalion were nevertheless then ordered to attack a ridge called Tekke Tepe as part of the ­catastrophic battle for Scimitar Hill.General Sir Ian Hamilton, ­Commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, had insisted that capturing Tekke Tepe was crucial to the success of the Gallipoli ­Campaign.As a sergeant following orders, Kennedy had been forced to drag his shattered and desperately thirsty men out of their trenches and into the face of the enemy.Kennedy had landed in the early hours of August  alongside  ­officers and  men. After three days of slaughter, his battalion had lost  officers and  men.In total, more than , troops died and , were wounded in the -month Gallipoli Campaign. Thousands were killed by disease.An unofficial history of the East Yorkshires says: “If ithad been held, the Gallipoli ­Campaign would have succeeded. The th East Yorkshires, who stormed the hill with limited support in dficult conditions were used inthe most important assault of the ­campaign.“They were bravely led and were ­decimated within sight of their ultimate objective.“The story of the th East Yorkshires at Tekke Tepe is not a particularly well researched or well understood part of the campaign, but it encapsulates everything in one small action that was wrong about Gallipoli.”Kennedy had been extraordinarily lucky to survive. But after a short ­period of recovery in Egypt, he and the rest of  Battalion were then thrust into some of the biggest and bloodiest battles in France and Belgium.In tiny, crabbed handwriting, his ­Soldier’s Paybook lists the scenes of slaughter that he incredibly survived, a litany of death — the Somme, Thiepval, Ypres, Messines, Lens and Loos and the Hindenburg Line. Kennedy and his ­Pioneers fought with distinction at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, part of the First Battle of the Somme, where ,, men died, and where tanks were used for the first time.During  he served on the ­Hindenburg Line, digging forward trenches, often under heavy shelling from the Germans.As historian Everard Wyrall noted in his  book The East Yorkshire ­Regiment In The Great War, these men endured “days and hours spent in a spot where death may come”.Sergeant Kennedy wrote himself into Wyrall’s history with an astonishing act of bravery in June , which earned him the Distinguished Conduct Medal. Building a huge railway line to carry British guns towards the German trenches at Messines, the Pioneers came under heavy bombardment.Wyrall wrote: “All of these areas were under direct observation from the enemy’s lines and the work of the ­Pioneers was of a most trying nature. Shortly before the battle opened, about  yards of the railway was blown up by shell fire.“But a gallant corporal, with ten men, working from pm to am the next morning, succeeded in running up  truckloads of rail and material, every bit of which had to be unloaded and carefully concealed.”The railway line had been saved and the planned British offensive could begin.Wyrall’s description, taken from ­regimental war diaries, almost exactly matches Kennedy’s official citation for the DCM published in the London Gazette the following year.After a period of fighting and digging trenches at the Battle of Polygon Wood, the second Battle of Arras and at Lens and Loos, Kennedy was finally — after more than three years of service amid the slaughter — handed a typewritten note giving him orders toto Blighty.More than , British men had died on those blasted battlefields. Incredibly he had not been one of them. Most men would have been content to slip back into civilian le and do their best to forget the horrors of war. But Kennedy was not most men.When Britain declared war on ­Germany again in , the East ­Londoner went straight down to a local recruiting office in Leyton. Asked his age, he lied and said . In reality he was . He casually told his we Mab he was going away “for work”.He was signed to the Royal Fusiliers thBattalion, ­consisting of men aged  to , who had seen service in the Great War. The battalion left for France from ­Southampton early on February ,  on the SS Fenella, landing at Le Havre.Forming part of the th Brigade in the th Division, the nd Battalion moved into the Brussels area on May . On May , the Germans attacked and the blitzkrieg forced them back towards the French border and ­eventually to Dunkirk.A measure of the horrors which the men faced at Dunkirk is revealed in C Northcote Parkinson’s history of the regiment, Always A Fusilier.It tells how they were shelled ­repeatedly as they scrambled from the beach and waded chest-deep in ­seawater to reach some of the hundreds of “Little Ships” which had come to rescue them.Again, Kennedy — nearly four decades older than many of his comrades on those Dunkirk beaches — had defied all odds to survive. Arriving in Dover, he did not have a penny to his name and had to ask a shopkeeperhe could use his phone to let Mab know he was still alive.Earlier that day his son Jack had got married, not knowingPop was alive or dead. Dunkirk proved one campaign too many. Found out for being too old and declared “no longer required” by the Army, he went home to the relative peace of Walthamstow, this time for good, from where he watched Luftwaffe bombs fall on London during the Blitz.Historian Paul Reed said: “John ­Kennedy would have forged documents to show he was younger than he was to re-enlist.“If you were a recruiting sergeant major sitting at a table and a guy comes in with the Distinguished ­Conduct Medal, you think, ‘He’s going to be a really useful guy to have’.“He probably used the old trick of putting some boot polish in his hair to hide the grey. John’s battalion were in France to guard petrol depots, ammunition supply points and communications. They weren’t meant to be involved in the fighting.“He would have been part of an orderly withdrawal but when he got to Dunkirk, I would imagine someone like him is not just going to stand by and do nothing. The Miracle of Dunkirk was part of the propaganda of . John would have been a hero of Dunkirk in the eyes of the public.”After the war, Pop went back to labouring and was still working aged  in  when he tore a heart muscle lting a heavy ladder and died — a tragic end to a le of bravery and devotion to duty.There is one regret that hangs over this story, however. I never got to tell him what a hero he really was.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Overall Scots voted  per cent to remain in the EU.Mr Blackford said: “We have to have the protection of knowing thatthe UK has a second vote and we end up in the same situation as we had in , we would be able to determine our own future. That would be only right and proper.”He added: “There has to be the right for Scotland to call a second referendum on independence.” But rivals last night united to slam the SNP’s stance.Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins branded them “the party of neverendum” by signalling backing for a second Brexit vote while pushing for IndyRef.Prof Tomkins said: “Today we’ve learnt that, not content with taking Scotland backwards, Nicola Sturgeon’s made clear she wants to drag the entire UK through a second referendum on Brexit too.“Scotland voted to stay in the UK and the UK voted to leave the EU. Scotland has had enough of Nicola Sturgeon’s endless complaints and demands for a rematch.”CHANCER OF THE DAY: A photographer tried to get Nicola Sturgeon to put her “Stronger for Scotland” slogan into action by trying out a bench press at a fitness expo at the SEC. Her spin doctors politely declined.BLAST OF THE DAY: Conference chairman Derek Mackay angrily cut off serial conference stage-stormer Gerry Fisher — who accused party bosses of being liars — telling him: “This is not a point of order, this is out of order.”CRACKPOT OF THE DAY: MP Joanna Cherry annoyed party bosses by claiming independence could be declared without a referendum.She said: “There has to be a democratic event, and I choose those words wisely, it doesn’t have to necessarily be a referendum, it could be something , like a general election.”MISSING IN ACTION: TheSNP’s top Holyrood spin doctor Fergus Mutch has raised a few eyebrows by going on holiday over the conference — blaming a family wedding.Lib Dem boss Willie Rennie, whose party has been leading calls for a People’s Vote, accused Nats of a “shoddy exploitation of Europe” by using it to push their independence agenda.The North East Fe MSP said: “After months of dawdling and deflection when it comes to a People’s Vote, it’s finally all out in the open.“The SNP only want the public to have the final say on Brexitit’ll suit them. The First Minister cynically plots and calculates while the Brexit clock ticks.“When it counts Nicola Sturgeon is missing — just like Jeremy Corbyn. We can’t sit idly by and let this devastation go ahead.“The public deserves to have the final say on whether the Brexit deal is good enough.”Labour’s Ian Murray, a campaigner for Brexit vote No, hailed the pledge.The Edinburgh South MP said: “Nicola Sturgeon has been reluctant to back a People’s Vote, so her U-turn is welcome.“Given we know there are Tory MPs who will vote for a People’s Vote — and with Labour backing the option of a People’s Vote at its conference — we are now heading towards a parliamentary majority for it.”But he added: “Unfortunately, however, the SNP is still putting its obsession with independence ahead of the best interests of the country.”christine.lavelle@the-sun"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000299995128.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"vapers save thousands life insurance","story":"A new comparison site for e-cigarette users will give them an option to save almost half of what they currently pay for le and critical illness insurance.Most insurance companies treat vapers the same as smokers and a -year-old smoker who takes out £, of le cover over  years, will pay around £. a month.That compares to a non-smoker who pays £. a month for the same level of cover.

Despite key EU leaders sounding more upbeat at the prospects of a deal in recent days, Brussels appears set to reject key aspects of the Prime Ministers Chequers proposals on Wednesday. However, it was reported that Mrs May hopes to break the deadlock over the Irish border issue by keeping the EUs present customs arrangements beyond when the transition period is due to end in December . Anti-EU Tory MPs have made it clear to the PM that this option could last no longer than the slated general election in , according to The Times.  This comes after optimistic noises from the EU that a deal could be completed within weeks, with Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney insisting that both sides were % there. Brexiteers opposed to Mrs Mays withdrawal proposals were buoyed by Japans prime minister Shinzo Abe saying he would welcome the UK into the Trans-Pacic Partnership trade bloc with open arms in the future. Such a move would need the UK to be outside the EU customs union and able to set its own tarfs. Leading Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Iain Duncan Smith have increased pressure on the PM by signalling they are prepared to soften their stance by accepting EU officials being stationed at UK ports post-Brexit in a bid to sink the Chequers plan.

Monstrous tanks and other vehicles churn up billowing clouds as they rumble along in searing -degree heat. Infantrymen in full combat gear shyswtly deploy to face the “enemy”. At sea a huge Navy task force has entered Omani waters while RAF jets have made their way to the Gulf State. This week the Sunday People joined the Armed Forces in Oman on the shybiggest UK military exercise in  years. Named Sa Sareea , or Swt Sword , it involves , British personnel,  armoured vehicles, six warships and eight Typhoon fighters.  War games in one of the world’s harshest environments have one motive – to ensure the UK is battle-ready to join international allies to tackle threats posed by the likes of Russia and ISIS. Strategists are mimicking so-called “peer-plus” military heavyweights – like Vladimir Putin’s army – so they can counter the world’s most elite forces. From Goodall Garrison at Camp Shafa, Brigadier Zac Stenning, commander of  UK Armoured Infantry Brigade, said: “We face many threats, this is an uncertain world. “As the Army, we want to be able to offer choices to our political leaders and UK citizens that we are capable of acting.  “It’s very hard to predict where the next crisis is but we want to ready for it. We train our army for a iety of dferent threats across the world.” The joint operation with the Omani forces comes as the UK faces a growing threat from Russia in the wake of the Novichok poisoning scandal. Earlier this year our Services head, Chief of the Defence Staff General Nick Carter, said Putin’s forces were the biggest threat to our way of le in years. This week a four-strong Russian hacking team was arrested outside the world’s chemical weapons watchdog in Holland — while attempting to sabotage the Salisbury probe. And while Britain wages information warfare on the Kremlin, Brigadier Stenning, the commander of  UK Armoured Infantry Brigade, said the military was keeping its eyes “wide-open” to a number of global threats.  He said: “This is an exercise in facing what we call a ‘peer plus’ opponent, rather than lesser opponents. “We are trying to put ourselves against those that might be the best equipped, those that might have the best training and those who would give us our toughest challenge. “Over the last two years we have looked at dferent threat vectors. We are growing more confident about how we might seek to confront and take down those threats as they come towards us. “You have heard the Chief of the Defence Staff speak quite publicly now about the threat from Russia. That is a pacing threat and he has publicly stated that. We keep our eyes wide open. “The fact is the world’s very uncertain, there are a lot of threat vectors.  “We have threats from Syria, there are crises in Africa, not necessarily purely military, as you saw British defence respond to Ebola. “There are many challenges out there that we have got to be capable of responding to.” The month-long war game in Oman will include training rapid reaction forces to deploy in crisis zones around the worldconflict is on the brink of erupting. And they are working on high-tech strike brigades designed to practice st-century warfare, using advanced technology to topple enemies. The Sunday People rolled out with the Mercian Regiment as they began the huge training exercise.  In the dead of night the awesome array of armoured vehicles including Warriors, Bulldogs and Trojans, thundered into le. We also joined the Royal Tank Regiment’s Cyclops squadron in staging war games over huge swathes of desert. Around eight miles from Camp Shafa, platoon commander Lieutenant Niall O’Malley Pearson led an attack on the “enemy” – represented by the Household Cavalry set up in a formation typically used by Putin’s forces. Lt Pearson, , rounded three Warriors before speeding across the dust and sending sand spilling into the air. And after calling “Release, release, release” on the radio a fourth vehicle thundered through the middle of the unit to attack an “enemy” Russian T tank.  Lt Pearson said: “When I give the ‘Release’ order, it’s brilliant, it’s like releasing a pack of dogs.” The military outfit will travel  miles from the camp, at the base of the Jebel mountains near the capital Muscat, across the desert to a finish point near Duqm Port. Meanwhile Armed Forces Minister Mark Lancaster said the relationship with the Omani forces was important as “violent extremist organisations seek to undermine stability”. He told sailors and Royal Marines assembled on the deck of the amphibious carrier HMS Albion it proved they were able to deploy anywhere in the Gulf “ the situation demands it”.

If necessary next year they will lt Benny in a giant “wet sling” before transferring him to a tank and flying him  miles to a sea sanctuary off Iceland. Dr Chris Parsons, a marine biologist who has been in touch with those monitoring Benny’s health, said: “In the long termthis animal starts failing, what they could do is move him or her to an interim facility in one of the sea le centres, then move it to the beluga whale sanctuary. “Maybe it’ll be OK over winter, but when it comes into next summer andthere’s yet another heatwave, that will not be great for this animal. The water temperature is too warm.  “To come into the Thames is really rather odd and of course there are concerns about pollution and whether it would pick up a disease.” But for the moment Benny the beluga will remain in the Thames unhindered, unless it begins to show signs of ill health or distress. Benny would be rehomed in a huge pen in Klettsvik Bay in an operation that would mirror the one mounted when Keiko, a ,lb killer whale, was flown from an aquarium in Newport, Oregon, to a tiny coastal Icelandic island. British Divers Marine Le Rescue, the team charged with taking care of Benny, confirmed they were considering proposals to eventually move the whale.

At first I was enjoying the ride and watched it before I got on to make sure it was OK, but after a while it just wasnt stopping and I started to feel really bad and was screaming to get off, said Georga.

It was really terrying, and Im glad that I had people around me to look after me. Also at the fair with Georga was her sister Kimberley Eyre, , and Kimberleys friend, who also went on the ride, and Kimberleys partner. The experience was also a frightening one for Kimberley, who witnessed Georgas distress. Georga was fine at first on the ride during the normal two loops that the ride does, and we had been on other big rides throughout the evening which she enjoyed, but then the ride just kept going and I heard Georga start to scream to get off, she said.

These exclusive pictures show how she arrived uninvited at the home the Duchess of Sussex shares with Prince Harry – but was turned away. Demanding to see Meghan, the outspoken -year-old was then locked in an embarrassing stand off with police guarding the gates of Kensington Palace. Fuming, she eventually left after handing over a note to an officer. It was the culmination of a y row, which has been played out in an excruciatingly public way.  Samantha flew in two weeks after palace officials received a letter saying her behaviour would “escalate”they did not arrange a meeting. Meghan has been attending an increasing number of public shyengagements and security around her has been beefed up since the row. Royal aides are now believed to be considering how to respond to the latest in a string of embarrassments which have left Meghan red faced. The source said: “The ongoing feud between Meghan, her sister and her father has so far been played out in public interviews and communication across the Atlantic via aides and shyrepresentatives.  “This was a huge move on the part of Meghan’s sister to try to see her face to face and the fact she was turned away speaks volumes. “This is the closest Meghan has come physically to that side of her family since she married into the royal family but palace staff had clearly been instructed not to allow her access.” In a bizarre moment during her visit  days ago, Samantha refused to leave the palace area and instead went on to buy royal merchandise – including Meghan and Harry masks – from a souvenir stand to take back to America.  Samantha, who suffers from MS, was accompanied by her partner, who pushed her wheelchair up to the entrance. But while the guards kept her out, it seems nothing can protect the Royals from the further embarrassment. In May, Meghan’s father, Thomas, , was exposed for selling pictures to the paparazzi ahead of the wedding. He failed to walk her down the aisle after suffering a heart attack following the scandal. He then gave his first British TV interview and leaked details of private conversations with Harry and Meghan before telling US press he felt frozen out. Samantha, Meghan’s half sister from her father’s first marriage, has vented her fury since she was denied an invite to the wedding. She called Meghan, , “cold” for ignoring their dad, accused her of fake waves and smiles, called her the DuchASS and labelled Harry a “wuss”.

Drenched in blood Sallie cradled mum-of-two Emma Day in the street, comforting her in her final moments, as she took her last breath. Moments earlier brave Sallie had desperately tried to fight off Emmas freakily calm ex, Mark Morris, as he repeatedly stabbed her in a row over child support after chillingly telling her Ill go to prison before you get a penny from me. Sallie then battled in vain to save Emmas le with CPR. Sallie, , said: He came flying past. I saw this shimmer, I clocked he had a kne. He just shoved the kne into Emmas back. I ran between him and Emma and did everything I could to fight him off. Dad who said Im really sorry to six-year-old daughter before stabbing her mum to death is jailed for leEmma turned and said what the f**k  I managed to get him off of her. He was coming either side of me with this kne. I just had to get him off her. I couldnt think about anything . I was screaming at him to stop, screaming for help, but he was totally silent. He was freakily calm. He was stabbing the mother of his child but he was calm. He looked like any other time I saw him. He didnt look angry or upset. He got a couple of slashes in and stabbed her one more time before I managed to get him off of her. I pushed him, he fell on the ground and then he ran away up the road. Emma then collapsed on the floor and there was blood everywhere. I was trying to stop the bleeding. Two people came out when they heard me screaming and tried to help. I called . The ambulance lady was telling me what to do for Emma. I was screaming at Emma not to leave, stay with me Emma, stay with me Emma. “I just had to keep her alive for her kids. Thats all that was going through my head. I have to keep her alive. She cannot die. He cannot kill her. Shes too young to die. Dad who said Im really sorry to six-year-old daughter before stabbing her mum to death is jailed for leMorris, , was sentenced to le in prison, to serve at least  years, for the attack in May last year. Hospital administrator Emma, , had asked Mark to pay pound,-a-year in child support for their six-year-old daughter after the couples eight-year relationship ended in . But Mark refused and repeatedly sent her threatening text messages, claiming he would kill himselfEmma did not cancel her child maintenance claim. Before the murder, he had researched ways online to kill himself, said goodbye to his work colleagues and told his daughter she would not see him again. And that morning, he sent Emma a text message about a grand finale before waiting outside the gates of their childs school, armed with the kitchen kne he would use to kill her. Every time you close your eyes you see the incident. Its like a video playing in your head, over and over again, said Sallie. “Mark was asked to pay pound a day in child support. He left his daughter with no mum and no dad for pound per day. “And he planned it. He took the kne with him from his own kitchen and he told his mum what he was going to do.” On that fateful day Emma had asked Sallie to walk her and the kids home because she was scared of what Morris might do. When he approached them Sallie sent Emmas two children back to her home along with her two kids. Sallie said: “Mark said he couldnt afford child support. We were there for about  minutes arguing. He was really irate and drunk but Emma stood her ground. She said she needed help with his child.With the amount of blood I knew it was serious. The ambulance people were going to operate on her on the road, they had to open my friend up on the concrete.  “But youre still telling yourself shes going to get through this. I didnt know at that stage he had punctured her heart. “They told me the last thing to go was her hearing. So she knew I was with her. She wasnt on her own. The first kne wound was the one that killed her because he got her heart then he stabbed her another four times. I overheard the ambulance man saying she was dead just as Marks mum turned up. She was crying and screaming. More than a year on Sallie is still haunted by the murder. Every single day theres something to remind me of her. For six months I couldnt go into the kitchen and chop anything with a kitchen kne. It was too much. The shower hitting my face reminded me of blood spattering on me. Just walking out the door, people walking around, you just want to scream, do you know whats happened  Its affected everything. Six years earlier and Emma and Mark had celebrated the happy news that Emma was pregnant with their first child together. It was a whirlwind romance after the pair met at a mutual friends BBQ.  Sallie recalls: They had some conversations and exchanged numbers but she wasnt overly interested at first. He seemed shy, she had her older son to think about and she wasnt long out of a relationship. But then they got together and he moved in pretty quick. I did think Mark was a bit strange, kind of moody. We both wonderedthey were moving too fast but I think living at Emmas was convenient for Mark. Then he lost his job at an Asda supermarket and it was all on Emma. They started arguing after that and he moved out. But they got back together, everything was good for a while. She was in love with him at the begining. There were a few things she didnt like about him but she just put that down to normal relationship stuff. But when Emma fell pregnant Morris became increasingly controlling and violent. It wasnt planned but Emma was very happy about it, said Sallie. She called me and said: You wont believe this but Im pregnant! Were pregnant at the same time! I laughed when she said it, I was pregnant with my second child at the time too. Mark was shocked but seemed happy that they were having a baby. But once she was pregnant he became very controlling. He was very controlling over her older child too and he was scared of him. Mark got increasingly controlling and moody and they had a few fights. He would constantly criticise her parenting of her older child. Hed say his child would never behave like this or that. When she had their child he was extremely controlling over that child too. Emma couldnt leave the child with anyone, he had to be there.  If she was out, he would message her  -  times over the space of an hour. Hed put her down, criticise her parenting, call her a selfish mum, and shed rush home. Id try to stop her but you have to let people do what they want to do. He had to know where Emma was, what time she was coming back, who she was with. Emma became distant from her family and stopped socialising with her friends, you couldnt really go to her house much anymore. In one sense it raised alarm bells but I thought theyre trying to make a family, everyones finding their feet, give them space. But when Emma started telling me and two other friends about his controlling behaviour, we told her she had to put a stop to it. He made comments about her being stupid, saying that she needed to be told what to do and couldnt make decisions for herself. Her confidence went really low as time went on. There were a few incidents where he had shoved her, and another incident that she reported to the police where he had pinned her to the bed and had bruised her arms. The last two years of her le she was pretty scared of him, and what he was capable of. He tried to pick up the kids from my house smelling of drink and turned up at school drunk to pick up his child. Emma got an injunction after that to stop him going near the kids or her.  He listened to it at first but then he would send six, seven, eight abusive text messages and voicemails daily, threatening her. She showed them to the police. Mark thought he was very intelligent. He could word things so it didnt come out like he was threatening her le but he would manipulate her by saying that he would take his own leshe didnt do what he wanted. Despite Marks abusive behaviour, Sallie said that Emma still wanted their daughter to maintain a relationship with her dad and his family. She would still drive the little one to his mums house to see him. He would then ask his daughterEmma was with anyone , and badmouth her to their child. Money was tight so Emma applied for child support. Thats when Mark got really vicious, he started hanging around the property and their childs school and the police were called several times about him but he had always left by the time police got there. Four days before he killed her, she texted me and said Mark was threatening her and her older child and threatened to take her younger child away. When I spoke to her she was crying. She said I think he might hurt me. As well as Sallie being left scarred from the events of that day, both her children have also suffered and are currently on waiting lists for counselling to help them. She said: My daughters have been on waiting lists since it happened. Theyre both emotional wrecks and really anxious. My youngest is scared to go to sleep and doesnt want to leave me. Shes up until am or am every night. If they got help when it happened they could be ok but now theyre not. And Sallie is plagued by questions about how Emmas death could have been avoided. I wish Emma had stayed in my house that day. If she had not gone around that corner she would still be here.

From turbulence fears to concerns about landing, these passengers can find themselves consumed by anxiety in the lead-up to flights. They may question how likely their plane is to crash, what would happenan engine failed, and whether a bird strike could be dangerous. They might even wonder whether another flier could break a window - andso, whether everyone would then be sucked out of the aircraft.And they may also fear the consequences of passengers leaving their phones on during take-off and landing, Wales Online reports. But how can anxious fliers ever know the answers to these for sure  Wales Online asked Patrick Smith - a US-based airline pilot and the host of www.askthepilot -  questions passengers may want to know. Some parts of the following answers are drawn from his book, called Cockpit Confidential: Everything You Need to Know About Air Travel.You can buy the book here .. Can turbulence ever be dangerous  It’s exceptionally rare for an airplane to suffer structural damage from rough air. That said, severe turbulence encounters occasionally cause injuries. Almost always, however, this is a result of passengers not having their seat belts fastened when they should. It stands to reason that as climate change intensies certain weather patterns, we’ll be seeing an uptick in unusually strong turbulence. Run-of-the-mill turbulence, meanwhile, although it can be annoying and uncomfortable, is rarely,ever, dangerous. When I began fielding questions from the travelling public, I was startled to discover how many people were terried by even mild turbulence. From a pilots perspective, rough air is by and large a comfort and convenience issue. Its annoying, but its not going to flip the plane upside-down or result in any of the catastrophic scenarios nervous fliers are prone to imagine. This gets into something that I call “passenger embellishment factor,” or PEF. That’s my term for people’s tendency to exaggerate the sensations of flight. The altitudes, speeds and angles you perceive often arent close to the real thing. During turbulence, for example, many people believe that an airplane is dropping hundreds of feet at a time, when in reality, even in relatively heavy turbulence, the displacement is seldom more than  feet or so – the slightest twitch on the altimeter. Related video: What its like to be a long-haul pilot  . Why do they tell you to turn your phone off during take-off and landing  What happensyou leave your phone on  Its unlikely that a mobile phone can cause problems in the cockpit, particularly on modern aircraft where components are, by design, carefully shielded, but its not impossible. I’d guess at least half of all phones, whether inadvertently or out of laziness, are left on during flight. That’s about a million phones a day in the United States. If indeed this was a recipe for disaster, I think we’d have more evidence by now. That said, phones may have had a role in at least two serious incidents. The key word there is “may”, as interference can be impossible to trace or prove. Some blame a phone for the unsolved crash of a regional plane in Switzerland in , claiming that spurious transmissions confused the plane’s autopilot. Interference also was cited as a possible factor in a fatal crash in New Zealand in . Ultimately, though, the phone thing is more of a social issue rather than a technological one. That is, do you really want to be sitting on an airplane listening to  people chatting away simultaneously  It’s possible that airlines are using the mere possibility of technical complications as a means of avoiding the social implications of allowing cellular conversations on planes. The minute regulators say that phones are safe, a percentage of fliers will demand the right to use them, pitting one angry group of travellers against another.  . What would happenthe landing gear didn’t come down when you were landing  Landing gear mals are pretty far down the hierarchy of things a pilot might worry about. If something is going to go wrong with your plane, the landing gear is one of the least hazardous places for it to happen. The one exception to this would be the possibility of tyre failure or fire following a high-speed take-off abort, but otherwise gear problems are pretty easy to manage. The absolute worst-case scenario would be a failure of the gear to deploy at all, in which case you’d make a more or less normal landing on the plane’s belly. There’d be a slight chance of rupturing a fuel tank, but with the emergency apparatus only a few feet away even this would be a relatively minor hazard. Flight attendant racially abused by passenger on Southwest Airlines flight - all because of a simple request . Could a passenger break a plane window and would everyone get sucked outthat happened  Those windows are a lot stronger than they might seem. If a window were to break, whether through accident or because of some intentional act, the plane would decompress very quickly. It’s possible, though unlikely, that somebody could be sucked through the hole in the initial seconds afterward, but it would not be the Hollywood-style catastrophe that people are prone to imagine. . Is it safe to fly during a storm  What happensthe plane gets hit by lightning  Using onboard radar, along with help from air traffic control and other flights aloft, pilots avoid thunderstorms the way ships avoid icebergs. Still, lightning strikes happen on occasion, and airplanes are designed accordingly. The energy does not travel through the cabin electrocuting the passengers it is discharged overboard, partly through discharge wicks along the trailing edges of the wings and tail, nine times in ten, leaving little or no evidence of the strike itself. Once in a while theres damage, most commonly to the planes electrical systems. In  lightning caused a wing explosion aboard a Pan Am . Afterwards, the FAA mandated several new protective measures, including fuel tank modications and the installation of those discharge wicks. That was over  years ago and I know of no other lightning-related disasters to date.  . What’s the scariest thing that’s happened to you while flying  The scariest thing that ever happened to me was a near midair collision. I was  years old at the time and flying a four-seat private plane. We were operating under “visual flight rules” in uncontrolled airspace. The fact this was so long ago, and that it involved only a small plane in comparatively primitive circumstances, should underscore the safety of commercial flying. I’ve been an airline pilot since  and, accounting for that entire span of time, not a single instance of fright jumps to mind. . What happensthe engine fails  All commercial jets are certied to fly with an engine failed. More than that, every airliner must be capable of accelerating and climbing away, even with total failure of an engine on takeoff. This guarantee extends beyond the airport perimeter to account for buildings, mountains, TV antennae and whatever . Data are computed prior to every departure to assure the ability to safely climb and avoid any nearby obstructions. Airport elevation, runway , and the weather all are factors. With shorter runways, high temperatures, or in mountainous terrain, this will sometimes entail a weight penalty.  . How likely is a plane to crash  Let me answer this way: the past decade has been the safest in commercial aviation history. The year , in fact, goes down as the safest on record. For a point of comparison, go back and take a look at the year , when, worldwide, major aviation accidents killed almost , people. That included two of historys ten deadliest disasters happening within two months of each other! The s, s and s were an era re with horric crashes, bombings, airport attacks and so on. Large-scale disasters have become a lot less frequent. If it seems like more planes are crashing, that perception is largely the result of the media and its relentless fixation with even minor mishaps, compounded by the effects of social media. In decades past there was no   news machine to feed, spread across multiple s and starving for sensationalist fodder. . How do you become a pilot  Historically, most airline pilots earned their wings and built experience in the armed forces. Nowadays, however, a majority of pilotscome up through civilian channels. It’s a long and very expensive process that involves the slow accumulation of flight hours along with the requisite licenses and ratings. Once you’ve got the necessary experience, you’ll typically start your airline career at one of the regional carriers. Very few pilots go straight to a major carrier. This is changing, though, as a growing number of airlines turn to so-called “ab-initio” programs, whereby select pilots are groomed and trained by a carrier from the ground up, so to speak, with no prior experience. Ab-initio programs are rare in North America, but increasingly common where.  . Is there a period of time where you’re a “learner” pilot and you’re being taught in the cockpit  After completing classroom and simulator training on a particular aircraft, pilots will fly under the tutelage of a training captain for a certain number of hours. This takes place in normal revenue operations, with passengers on board. . How much does a computer fly a plane and how much do you fly a plane  Cockpit automation, and how pilots interact with that automation, is the single most exaggerated and misunderstood topic in all of commercial aviation. People have a vastly, vastly exaggerated sense of what an autopilot is, and what it’s capable of. Its true that pilots have come to rely on a somewhat dferent skill set. Seat-of-the-pants talents are a smaller part of the job than they were in decades past. Still, even the most routine flight is subject to countless contingencies and a tremendous amount of input from the crew.You will sometimes hear, for example, how pilots spend just three minutes actually piloting their plane over the course of the typical flight. Statements like this, which appear all the time, are highly deceptive. What they’re trying to say is that pilots nowadays spend a relatively brief amount of time with their hands physically on the control column or stick .That does not mean we arent controlling the airplane throughout the entire flight. Cockpit automation is not flying the plane. The pilots are flying the plane through the automation . The crew still needs to tell it what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. There are, for example, no fewer than six dferent ways that I can set up an “automatic” climb or descent on the Boeing that I fly, depending on circumstances. On any flight there are periods of high workload, and periods of low workload, but you’d be surprised how busy a cockpit can become - to the point of task-saturation - with the autopilot on .A comparison between flying and medicine is maybe the best one: modern technology helps a pilot fly a plane the way it helps a surgeon perform an operation. A jetliner can no more fly itself than an operating room can remove a tumor or perform an organ transplant by itself. Meanwhile, more than % of landings, and a full % of takeoffs are performed manually, hands-on, with either the captain or the first officer at the controls. . Have you ever seen another plane nearby and thought it was too close  Getting back to the earlier question, only one, when I was a private pilot in a four-seater. Passengers often misconstrue the distances between planes. This is another example of PEF. While we were flying to Paris, somebody will recall excitedly. Another plane passed so close to us, you could see the people inside!” While landing on parallel runways or crossing perpendicularly at high altitudes, airliners often pass within close proximity. But close proximity, in the doings of air traffic control, is measured in miles, or in thousands of feet. During cruise, vertical separation is never less than a thousand feet. To an anxious flier, distances and sensations are distorted. Planes are big, and yes, a  zooming past you, a thousand feet above or below, appears to be very close. But trust me, you have never, ever been remotely close enough to another plane to see faces through those small oval windows. . Why do all planes always fly at, feet Typical cruising altitudes y from , feet through , feet, give or take. The altitude you’re assigned depends on air traffic control constraints and, of course, the capabilities of the aircraft. Every aircraft type has a maximum allowable altitude. Generally, the higher you go, the less fuel you burn. But only to a point, and just because a plane can cruise at , feet doesn’t mean that it will do so every flight. Air traffic control might have other ideas in mind, and or the plane might be too heavy. We will sometimes “step climb” to a more efficient altitude as fuel is burned off. . Whats it like flying through clouds or in the dark when you can’t see anything in front of you  It’s dark and you can’t see anything in front of you. . Are bird strikes dangerous  Bird strikes are very common and rarely harmful — unless you’re talking from the bird’s point of view. I should hardly have to mention, however, that strikes are occasionally hazardous, such as when US Airways flight  went gliding into the Hudson River after both engines failed following a collision with a flock of geese. Modern turbofans are resilient, but they don’t take kindly to the ingestion of foreign objects, particularly those slamming into their rotating blades at high speeds. Birds don’t “clog” an engine but can bend or fracture the internal blades, causing power loss. The heavier the bird, the greater the potential for harm. Flying at  knots — in the United States, that’s the maximum allowable speed below , feet, where most birds are found — hitting an average-sized goose will subject a plane to an impact force of over , pounds. Your next question, then, is why aren’t engines built with protective screens in front  Well, in addition to partially blocking the inflow of air, the screen would need to be largeand incredibly strong. Should it fail, now you’ve got a bird and pieces of metal going into the motor. The incidents above notwithstanding, the vast improbability of losing multiple engines to birds renders such a contraption impractical.

Tiny Milburn School in Cumbria only has one classroom and just one full-time teacher .The school is so small, three-year-olds learn alongside ten-year-olds and their lunches are cooked by a local pub chef. Pupils play on the picturesque village green during breaks because there is no playground. And residents in the medieval village of Milburn, on the edge of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, are invited to take part in Sports Day in order to boost numbers.  The Christmas nativity play is also tricky, as there aren’t enough pupils and staff to take all the parts. In the rural setting, the children often have to stop playing as tractors pass by and there are no fences surrounding the small single building. There have been a number of attempts made to close the school - all of which have been vigorously opposed by the village. In , it had  pupils but numbers dropped as low as three in  following a dip in population in the hamlets surrounding Milburn. But despite its rural setting, the Church of England school is packed full of technology, including VR goggles and there are more laptops than there are pupils. Alongside lessons in the classrooms, pupils also enjoy the freedom of learning outdoors in their forest school.  The children - aged from three to ten years old - are often taught together in one group. Headteacher Nick Page says that the low number of students means they benefit from one-to-one teaching. He said: “Milburn is very special school in terms of its location, its number of pupils and what it has to offer. Hayley Dixon, , - the only full-time teacher - joined the school in September. She said: “I enjoy the flexibility that it has to offer and being able to go with things that are happening in the village.” Mr Page, , previously worked in an inner-city school in Brixton, south London, and now champions small schools. An Ofsted report in  - when Milburn had  pupils - ranked the school overall as ‘good”, noting that pupil’s development and welfare was “outstanding.” Since becoming executive headteacher in July, Mr Page is confident that the school will further improve. He splits his time as head between Milburn School and nearby Beaconside Primary School, which has  pupils.  Every Wednesday, the six pupils travel to his other school, in Penrith, a  minute drive away. There they benefit from specialist sports coaching, religious education, French and music lessons. The students adapt quickly to le in a busier environment but love ing to their village school, said Mr Page. He said: “Its easy to think to think that children in a small school may lack confidence because they’re not in a big environment.

The news was announced via a statement on the Ministry of Public Securitys website on Monday.On Sunday, Interpol, the France-based global police coordination body, said that Meng had resigned as its president. Earlier on Sunday, China said it was investigating Meng, who is also a vice minister for public security in China, for suspected violations of the law. The investigation against Meng Hongweis taking and giving bribes and suspected violations of law is very timely, absolutely correct and rather wise, the ministry said in a statement following an internal meeting.  Meng has not been seen since September  as he left Lyon in France, where Interpol is based, to travel to China. Yesterday, Mengs we revealed he sent her a photo of kne before he disappeared. His we Grace believes the photo Meng sent her four days before he vanished was his way of saying he was in danger, US media is reporting. Grace, who is currently under police protection after receiving death threats, told reporters that four minutes after receiving the kne photo, Meng sent another message saying Wait for my call. She has not heard from him since.  Chinese authorities said yesterday he was under investigation for unspecied violations of the law. It comes as one source said the initial working assumption was that Meng had antagonised Chinese authorities in some way and had been detained as a result. France is puzzled about the situation of Interpols president and concerned about the threats made to his we, the ministry said, adding that it was in contact with China. It was not clear why Meng, , who was named Interpols president two years ago, had travelled to China, which has not commented officially on his disappearance. There have been several cases in recent years of senior Chinese officials vanishing without explanation, only for the government to announce weeks or even months later that they have been put under investigation, often for suspected corruption.  Hong Kongs South China Morning Post quoted an unnamed source as saying Meng had been taken for questioning as soon as he landed in China, but it was not clear why. French police are investigating what is officially termed in France a worrying disappearance. Hours later, Interpol said in an official statement that Hongwei had resigned from his position with immediate effect. Kim Jong Yang of South Korea has replaced him as acting president. until a new president can be elected at the next General Assembly Session in Dubai, November -.  Interpol, which groups  countries and which is usually focused on finding people who are missing or wanted, said in a statement from its secretary general, Juergen Stock, that it had asked China for clarication. Interpol has requested through official law enforcement channels clarication from Chinas authorities on the status of Interpol President Meng Hongwei, Stock, who is in charge Interpols day-to-day running, said on Saturday. Roderic Broadhurst, a professor of criminology at Australian National University, said Mengs disappearance would be pretty disconcerting for people in international bodies that work with China. It added that it could ultimately damage Chinas efforts to develop cooperative legal assistance measures with other countries.  It is bizarre, Broadhurst said on Saturday, adding that China was likely to brush off any political damage that it would cause to Beijings involvement in international bodies. Its a price that might have to be paid, but I guess they would see that as a cost worth bearing, Broadhurst said. Presidents of Interpol are seconded from their national administrations and remain in their home post while representing the international policing body. Meng is listed on the website of Chinas Ministry of Public Security as a vice-minister, but lost his seat on its Communist Party Committee in April, the South China Morning Post reported. Meng has almost  years experience in criminal justice and policing, and has overseen matters related to legal institutions, narcotics control and counter-terrorism, according to Interpols website.

He has gone on trial in a criminal court charged with endangering the lives of persons by putting poison or spoiling the food with other means which carries a sentence of two to  years in prison. And he also faces a consumer court charge of damaging goods and endangering customers health which carries a sentence of between four months and three years behind bars. Burak S. told the criminal court that he did not spit on the pizza and had only opened the box to ensure it was not damaged as he had been in an accident enroute. He said: I found out that the person who ordered the pizza had cursed my colleague Aylin. I knew he was a problem customer. I opened the box of the pizza to check for any problems, to check whether the pizza was still intact. I took a picture of the pizza with my mobile phone and sent it to my friend Aylin. I absolutely did not spit when I opened the box. However, Mr Alyuz told the court: I called the pizza shop and ordered a pizza. It was a two-minute conversation and I did not curse anybody.

last season, the enigmatic attacker ed for the final six minutes of the club’s first league win of the season – at the seventh time of the asking – at Hamilton and, in the process, set up the second goal.And hiswas hailed by manager Neil McCann.He said: “Roarie Deacon I am really pleased about getting back in because we have suffered some real injury problems of late.“He hadn’t featured at all, he’d only had  minutes of football all season before Saturday but I knew putting him on he could secure the ball because he is so strong.“You can’t get close to Roarie and he turned the boy beautully, then he had the composure.“I have to commend the other boys as well because they were still trying to get into the box at that stage to get the killer goal.”Deacon himself was delighted to be back in action after his y spell out.A process that was extended after an older injury reared its head once more.His debut season was also curtailed by injury with a troublesome thigh problem picked up in December at Hearts keeping him out of action for a big chunk of the middle of the campaign.And, on histo training this season, he hurt the same thigh once more.Deacon said: “I had ankle surgery the first week into pre-season.“I twisted it and damaged ankle ligaments in the game against Partick and through the summer it didn’t heal itself.“The surgeon didn’t want to operate initially but it didn’t heal itself so we made the decision to go under the kne to sort it out.“I was supposed to be back a little earlier than this but on the first session back I re-injured my thigh, a problem I had last season, so I needed a bit of intense rehabilitation on that to get back.“Now, though, I am ready to go and I’m fit.”With goals being a real issue for the side – just four scored in their seven league games and half of them against Accies at the weekend – Deacon’sis a timely boost for the Dark Blues.In fact, he’s only played around six minutes this season but has already had a hand in a quarter of their league goals.Coming into the side struggling for goals and points, though, hasn’t ruffled Deacon in any way.And Dundee fans will be hoping his direct running and ability to go past people is the key that unlocks defences with tough matches against Kilmarnock on Saturday and then Livingston, Hearts and Celtic in the next month.The former Sutton man admits he’s surprised the Dark Blues find themselves bottom of the table as he s to fitness and has backed them to get up the table,they keep doing what they’ve been doing.He added: “I am very surprised, everyone is surprised.“No way we thought we would come in, do well in pre-season, and then come in and after six games not have a point on the board.“However, after Hamilton everyone is positive, you can’t not be because the way we’ve been playing it’s not like we’ve not created chances or played well despite not getting points.“Everyone is buzzing about in training, raring to go and wanting to do well for Dundee.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb785d1b83ec-844x564.jpg ","title":"dundee basketball team makes dream come true for young baller molly

Such was Aberdeen’s attacking intensity they punished a porous St Mirren defence with more holes than the SPFL’s logic when scheduling semi-finals or ticket allocations.McInnes had confirmed he aims to utilise two strikers regularly this season and now faces a five-way fight for those places.Cosgrove has fired himself into contention, with McLennan –he recovers from his dislocated shoulder – also in the mix.Bruce Anderson, who has impressed this season when given a chance, cannot be discounted.Whoever gets the nod will have to deliver goals as they cannot allow Premiership leaders Hearts to further extend the points gap.For all Aberdeen’s later dominance, the game began tentatively and the first opportunity came when a Max Lowe drive from -yards was deflected wide by Cosgrove.Gary Mackay-Steven fired a attempt inches wide of keeper Craig Samson’s goal in the st minute.The opener arrived in the th minute when Shay Logan whipped in a left-footed cross from the right into the box.COSGROVE met the ball with a ing header at full stretch and brilliantly directed it into the far corner.Only the woodwork stopped it being - moments later when Mackay-Steven danced over the ball, stepped inside and curled a -yard left-footed shot that cracked off the far postTeenager MCLENNAN then collected a pass on the half-turn and bent a magnicent -yard drive that crashed off the underside of the bar and over the line.It was - and three points in the bag in the st minute. Mackay-Steven’s shot deflected to LOWE, who was left unmarked with the goal beckoning, and he calmly slotted in from  yards.Aberdeen should have been awarded a penalty in the rd minute when Shinnie broke from the left flank into the box.He was pulled back by Jack Baird who impeded him as he fired off a shot. It was a stone-wall spot-kick but referee Alan Muir waved play on.Early in the second half, Dons keeper Joe Lewis, on his st birthday, nearly gted the Buddies a bizarre goal when his clearance ricocheted off the back of Jackson.The ball spun up towards goal and Lewis had to race back to palm the ball off the line.McLennan had to come off having dislocated a shoulder when falling awkwardly in a sliding tackle on Cammy MacPherson.It was - in the th minute. Lowe hit the byline and crossed into the box to COSGROVE who instinctively shot at goal from  yards.Keeper Samson got both hands to it but only pushed it on to a post and it went over the line.When the two-goal hero was substituted with  minutes left, Cosgrove left to a standing ovation from the Red Army.St Mirren grabbed a consolation in the th when a slack pass from Stephen Gleeson was intercepted. Cammy Smith crossed to Simeon JACKSON who dinked it over Lewis.Aberdeen had nine players sidelined for the clash with St Mirren, eight through injury and one suspended.Teenager Connor McLennan had a bitter-sweet first start for Aberdeen.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr seafront street cordoned following","story":"NewsAyr seafront street cordoned off following major police presenceIt is believed a man is attempting to jump off a roof on Queen Terrace in Ayr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsQueens Terrace\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young man threatened to jump -feet to the pavement in an astonishing roof-top stand-off in a street full of guest houses.

Luckily Batman, PH’s Mr Rory Hall sprung into action to free the cute creature. The superhero was accompanied by sidekick Robin- or rather the school’s janitor Brian Robb. The pair worked together to prise open the window and get the winged animal to safety, while other staff members stood below with a safety net. And the Pipistrelles bat even received some special treatment of a cosy box and a well deserved drink before the Bat Society team popped along to get the animal back to Gotham City.  Janitor Brian said: “We knew it was there during the day but we just thought it was hanging there. “But parents said to me later on that it was still there. “We contacted the Bat Society to see what we should do as we knew they were protected. “It’s wing had actually been caught, so I had to go up beside Mr Hall and prise the window frame open with a screwdriver. “We put it into a box then Mr Hall gave it some water and later on that night we released it.” Rory added: “I spent a couple of hours and stayed with it to make sure it was calm and relaxed. “I gave it a solution of salt, sugar and warm water, which the Bat Society gave us, and it was like an energy drink for him. “Half an hour after that, I took it out and hung it out at the sensory garden and off it flew.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13347961.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_nip_rgr_041018flowers_1JPG.jpg","title":"caring toryglen grans who set","story":"NewsCaring Toryglen grans who set up club for pensioners are honoured in new Reformer competitionShareByNiki Tennant:,  OCT NewsCathy and Suzanne were delighted with their flowers, presented by Cathys daughter Meika \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo caring grans, who have opened up a new world of fun and friendship for Toryglen pensioners, have become the first recipients of stunning bouquets in the Reformer’s new Say it with Flowers competition.When Meika Thomson read that the Rutherglen Reformer wanted to say ‘thanks a bunch’ every week to unsung heroeswho make a real dference to their community, she didn’t hesitate to nominate her mum Cathy and best friend Suzanne Curran for a beautul bouquet from Burnside florist, Stems.Cathy and Suzanne, who have run the Toryglen After School Care club for  years, refused to turn the other cheek when they saw pensioners from a neighbouring sheltered housing complex staying indoors, living in isolation and lacking company and companionship. Saying hello to Cathy and Suzanne as they passed the Geoff Shaw community centre where the after school club meets was often the only interaction some of the pensioners from the Thistle Housing complex had. When Polmadie Fire Station donated a snooker table to the club nearly three years ago, Cathy and Suzanne saw it as an opportunity to persuade elderly residents to leave their armchairs and drop into the centre for a game of snooker and a chat. A resident from the housing complex spread the word among his neighbours and soon eight men were going to the centre to while away their afternoons and evenings with a game of snooker and friendly banter. Glasgow Le’s Mark Hudson suggested establishing a sports hub in the centre and advised Cathy and Suzanne how to apply for funding. Thanks to the two grans, carpet bowls, team tennis, boccia, badminton, sitting tai chi and computing classes were soon added to the list of activities on offer at the centre for Toryglen pensioners. “We had a marvellous time getting to know them,” said, Cathy, , of King’s Park.  “At first, they were gentlemanly, but within two weeks, they’d come out of their shell and were just being themselves.” Before she and Cathy stepped in, Suzanne said elderly residents from the housing complex on Kerrylamont Avenue would pass each other as strangers on the way to the local shops. Now they are friends who are in and out of each other’s homes. “It is just wonderful, seeing the dference in their lives,” said -year-old Suzanne, of Toryglen. “Seeing them from hardly walking to totally changing is marvellous. One man did not go out the house after losing his we a couple of years before, and he just loved the company.” Volunteers Cathy and Suzanne organised a bus to take the neighbours on a day trip to Ayr - and the appreciative group paid for the pair’s seats to the seaside. The two women are now planning their annual pensioners’ Christmas lunch at which kids from the after school club will delight diners by singing carols. In nominating her mum and Suzanne, Meika told the Reformer: “Some of these men had not even been outside their doors in over a few years, so this got them back into the community. Most recently, they have set up a memories group where they meet and talk about the past. “These groups have created a great feeling and the residents have created a great relationship with Cathy and Suzanne and also give the kids from the after school a wee hello when they pass by.” Choking back the tears as Meika presented them with the Stems’ bouquets, Cathy said: “I am speechless. We don’t often get a pat on the back. That’s not what we do this for. But to be acknowledged like this is simply wonderful.” To nominate someone for a hand-crafted bouquet from Stems, send your name, address and contact number, the name of the person you wish to nominate and information about why you think they deserve to receive the Bouquet of the Week to: Say It With Flowers competition, Rutherglen Reformer, One Central Quay, Glasgow G DA, or email news@rutherglenreformer.

Since then South Ayrshire Council has tried and failed to negotiate with him in an attempt to keep the rat-infested building safe. Two dangerous building notices were issued.

phone calls from concerned constituents about the recent building work in Bowmore.It has seen a footpath being built over one side of Bowmore#s rugby pitch.I had a meeting with the Islay rugby team and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset caused by this

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere.

The whole idea of being able to change someones outlook on le or change someones path in a positive way is incredible.\"A good teacher has the potential to have a positive influence on a pupil for the rest of their le. Eventhat only ever happens once then that is remarkable and the thought of having that impact is what drew me in.\"Sixty-year-old Glasgow-born Aileen Barrie, who lives in Airdrie, voices the same passion for teaching despite more than half a letime in the classroom.Now retired, the geography teacher said: \"I loved teaching. I loved being in the class with the children. When the door was shut and I was in with the kids that was the bit of the job I always loved.\"But her experiences in North Lanarkshire also left her disillusioned with the way schools were being run, with increasing pressures placed on teachers, mounting paperwork, cuts to resources and dwindling pay.\"It was things outwith the classroom that got to me eventually and I took early retirement. The level of assessment has become ridiculous with folder upon folder for each pupil.\"I felt isolated because of the constant cuts to support staff at a time when more pupils were coming into the classroom with increasing levels of dficulties.\"Overall, the pressure and stress definitely got worse. I always brought work home and when you enter teaching you expect that, but latterly it was well above what was acceptable.\"The \"last straw\" for Mrs Barrie was a request by her headteacher that she teach modern studies and history as well as geography to first year pupils.\"It was a financial move because it was easier to timetable, but I have got a science degree with geography and I havent done any history or modern studies since I was at school,\" she said.\"What does that tell us about the level of esteem we hold these subjects and these pupils in - that anybody can teach them without any qualications  It really angered me.\"Mrs Barrie is not alone in her concerns. A disturbing survey published earlier this year suggested a majority of Scottish teachers would not recommend the job to others.The poll by the Educational Institute of Scotlandteaching union found  per cent of respondents were unlikely to endorse the career to others while only two per cent would be \"very likely\" to do so.The greatest concern was spiralling workload, while changes to the curriculum and qualications, teacher shortages and stagnant pay were also highlighted as key areas of dissatisfaction.Like Mrs Barrie, teachers also raised concerns about the lack of support staff at a time when inclusion policies have led to an increase in pupils with more challenging behaviours.This apparently widespread disenchantment with teaching appears to be having an impact on recruitment and retention.Just over a decade ago there were more than , teachers in Scotland, but by  this had fallen to just over ,. While numbers have improved since then progress has been marginal.While teacher numbers will increase or decrease over time to reflect fluctuations in pupil numbers, the dficulties schools face in filling vacancies is a key indication of the popularity of teaching.This summer, just weeks before the start of the new school year, there were  unfilled vacancies across  of Scotlandrsquos  council areas.Many of the local authorities most affected serve rural areas including Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Moray, the Highlands and the Western Isles.There have also been shortages of specialist teachers in key subjects such as mathematics, physics and computing. The Scottish Government has responded by increasing the number of teacher training places available, but some of the targets in shortage subjects have not been met.In addition, new figures revealed by The Herald show more than a thousand teachers under the age of  have left the profession in the past two years, with teaching watchdogs highlighting lucrative offers overseas as well as pressures in Scottish classrooms.At a time when teachers are moving towards strike action over the latest impasse in salary levels, Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, argues the issue of pay is critical in restoring wider respect for the profession with a \"boom and bust\" approach in recent decades the underlying problem.Teachersrsquo pay has decreased signicantly since the McCrone Agreement of , which followed an independent inquiry on pay and conditions. A recent international report also concluded the pay of Scottish teachers was relatively low when compared to other graduate professions.Mr Flanagan said: \"Coupled with the countryrsquos continuing slide down international comparisons on pay, Scotlandrsquos teachers have endured a real-terms pay cut over the past decade.\"This has created a situation where teaching is no longer a desirable career for many graduates, with serious implications for teacher recruitment and retention and for education provision in many parts of the country.\"Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association, agrees pay is critical, but believes a wider review of the expectations on teachers is just as important.\"What is expected of teachers now is becoming unmanageable. There are no curriculum leaders any more and declining support staff so teachers are on their own with responsibility for all sorts of extra duties. Pay is a big issue, but the workload is the biggest problem.\"The Scottish Government argues it is working hard to make teaching as attractive and accessible as possible and that recent figures show the tide is finally turning.John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said: \"We know there are challenges to overcome in teacher recruitment in Scotland, but we are facing these head on and the steps we are taking are working.\"Teacher numbers have increased for the second year in a row and there are now more primary and secondary teachers than at any time since  and the ratio of pupils to teachers is at its lowest since , this is welcome progress.\"But are there other factors at play  The issue of teacher shortages is not one that just affects Scotland. Some , teachers in England quit the profession in  representing about nine per cent of the workforce.Ken Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council for Scotland, argues wider societal factors are in part responsible for the current dficulties around teacher recruitment.Teaching, particularly in the primary sector, has always been heavily dominated by females, but in recent decades opportunities for women in other professions have increased substantially.\"One of the good things about Scottish society is that we have opened up more opportunities for women to embark on a much wider range of careers than was every the case before and teaching, because of its dominance of females, suffers as a result of that,\" said Mr Muir.Mr Muir also believes new post-Millennial \"iPad generation\" have a dferent attitude towards their careers than was the case in the past.\"We are seeing youngsters who have been exposed to a dferent type of background who are much more inclined to try something out and,it doesnt work, then they press the reset button and try something ,\" he said.\"That kind of mentality is something we are seeing much more of in teaching and it is one of the reasons why we cannot retain some of the younger teachers.\"The first couple of years are the most dficult andyou are one of these Millennials who is used to hitting the reset button when they are playing computer games then they take that kind of thinking into how they see their career and look for something .\"There is also a fear that intense political scrutiny on education with rival parties seeking to undermine the governments credibility on its self-styled \"defining mission\" is also fuelling negativity, which is then mirrored in the media.Brian Boyd, emeritus professor of education at Strathclyde University, believes there is a responsibility on politicians and journalists to think carefully about whether the narrative being created around education reflects current classroom experience. But he also believes teachers have a responsibility to talk up the job.\"There is so much negativity around schooling from political parties scoring points and that gets through to young people and they dont see it as a job for them. It seems to me we have to change that and at least sell teaching as a worthwhile profession with a high intellectual content.\"There is something in the psyche of teachers that makes them self-deprecating and they tend to talk teaching down to others and yet these are often teachers who love the job and have always been very enthusiastic about it.\"Probationer, Nicola Day, , who is currently teaching in a primary school in Fe, cant think of a better career than teaching and is happy to talk it up, but she also wonders whether ministers are genuinely listening to the concerns of the profession.\"Before becoming a teacher you have to make sure you really want to do it because you have to put your whole self into it. If you dont care with every fibre of your being then you are not going to be able to do it.\"That makes it a very tough job and the more dficult teaching is made because of curriculum changes or more paperwork or lower pay then the harder it will be to attract people. I think politicians need to listen to teachers more because so many voices in the profession are in agreement that these are the issues that need to be tackled.\""},{"url":null,"title":"government-set-to-back-world-leading-reforms-on-lgbti-education-in-schools","story":"The changes, which followed a campaign spearheaded by two equality activists, include relationships, sexual health and parenthoodeducation and an overhaul of how homophobic bullying is recorded.Ministers are believed to be sympathetic to a package of reforms that were produced by a range of stakeholders including the Catholic Church.Founded in  by Jordan Daly and Liam Stevenson, the lsquoTime for Inclusive Educationrsquocampaign was set up to combat homophobia, biphobia and transphobia in schools by calling for LGBT \"inclusive education.According to critics of the status quo, the support offered in schools for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex pupils is either patchy or non-existent.The TIE campaign urged MSPs to sign up to its five-point plan, which included a teacher training programme on LGBT issues, a reformed system for recording bullying and provisions relating to RSHP education.It also called for legislation requiring schools to be proactive in tackling bigotry, as well as better data collection.A majority of MSPs endorsed the TIE demands and the SNP Government responded by setting up a working group.The body, which included Mr Stevenson and Mr Daly, as well as representatives from the Catholic Church and the Educational Institute of Scotland, was asked to advise Ministers on the TIE pledges and make recommendations.Members of the thirteen-strong group are said to have largely backed the TIE pledges, including RSHP education, bullying and ensuring LGBT issues are covered in the curriculum.It is understood the group issued a report to the Scottish Government recently and Ministers are expected to announce support for the recommendation within weeks.However, the group has not backed a legislative approach, which paves the way for the reforms to be implemented without a new law.An SNP source described the recommendations as \"world leading\".The report comes nearly  years after the Labour-led Scottish Executive faced a backlash for repealing anti-gay legislation relating to schools.Under the Thatcher Government, local authorities were banned from promoting homosexuality, a policy which was believed to be discriminatory.The former First Minister, Donald Dewar, described the law as a ldquobadge of shame and made repeal an early priority for his administration in .However, SNP donor and businessman Brian Souter opposed the move and funded a private referendum in a bid to halt repeal.The Daily Record newspaper and the Catholic Church in Scotland, led at that point by Cardinal Winning, were also vocal opponents of Dewarrsquos policy. MSPs voted by  to  to abolish the ban.A TIE spokesperson said: \"We are delighted with the suite of recommendations in this report, as agreed upon by the LGBTI Inclusive Education Working Group, and they address the issues raised in our campaign pledge.\"These recommendations will deliver LGBTI-inclusive education in Scottish schools, thus transforming the educational experience for generations of LGBTI young people. We now hope that they will be accepted in full by the Scottish Government.\"Green MSP Ross Greer said: ldquoThis would be a monumental victory for the TIE campaign, LGBT young people and Scotland as a whole. Jordan, Liam and the team of volunteers at TIE have in just a few years and on a shoestring budget completely transformed the debate around inclusive education and it looks like itrsquos about to pay off.\"If the recommendations are as robust as is believed and the government commits to implement them in full, they will have the backing of a majority of MSPs and Irsquom sure of most people across the country. Almost twenty years after Section , the long shadow it has cast over our schools is finally set to be consigned to history.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoThis report has yet to be published. Ministers will consider its findings carefully before making an announcement in due course."},{"url":null,"title":"paul-hutcheon-nicola-sturgeon-is-a-leader-in-need-of-a-vision","story":"THE SNP exists to deliver one political objective, but the party leadership seems keen to talk about anything other than the constitution at their conference in Glasgow this week.Nicola Sturgeon, still scarred by the memory of backing a second independence referendum only to be rebuffed by voters at general election, wants to say as little as possible on the timing of another vote.Deputy First Minister John Swinney, in a pre-conference press release, tellingly focused on the so-called domestic achievements of the SNP Government. Independence was only mentioned in passing.But such a sht raises dficult questions for Ms Sturgeon, who is edging towards her fourth anniversary as First Minister. If she quit tomorrow, what would her legacy be  In what way has she shted the power balance inside Scotland Politicians can achieve much in four years. By , Attleersquos Labour Government had created the NHS, legislated for a ldquocradle to grave welfare state and nationalised the railways.In Mrs Thatcherrsquos first term, the Tories clamped down on ldquoclosed shop arrangements in trade unions and allowed council tenants to buy their own homes. Many ofTony Blairrsquos most successful policies were pushed through in his first four years.A like-for-like comparison would be unfair on Ms Sturgeon. Attlee, Thatcher and Blair enjoyed huge majorities and had the full powers of the state to alter society fundamentally.However, Ms Sturgeon did inherit a majority from Alex Salmond, but lost it at the last election. She has also more powers at her disposal, including on tax and social security, than any of her predecessors. Our fth First Minister has the opportunity to effect transformational change.It is dficult to paint Ms Sturgeon as a leader with a radical record. Minimum unit pricing of alcohol was a bold move, but technically the legislation passed when Alex Salmond was First Minister. Integration of health and social care was a massive change, but have the public noticed Other policies seem symbolic rather than substantive. Ms Sturgeonrsquos child poverty targets become measurable in  and she wants Scotland to become ldquocarbon neutral twenty years later. It is easy to set targets which will fall on others to meet.As for plans to create a National Investment Bank and a publicly-owned \"not-for-profit\" energy company, these initiatives fall squarely into the category of ldquoyet to be delivered.Ms Sturgeon can expect to be judged on the three totemic issues she can influence: the health service closing the educational attainment gap and cutting poverty levels.On the NHS, which she used to run, some health boards have been so badly managed that they over-spent their budgets and incurred poundm in bail out loans. The Government solution is to wipe out the debts. Even SNP loyalists believe the move sends a message that financial profligacy will eventually be subsidised.Education - the First Ministerrsquos top priority - is faring little better. Swinney had to shelve plans for a ldquogovernance bill and support for P assessments has crumbled. Some of the poundm ldquopupil equity fund money given to headteachers has been spent reversing budget cuts previously passed on by the Government.For Ms Sturgeonrsquos critics, there is no golden thread running through the piecemeal, incremental changes implemented by her Government. They want a vision and a narrative, not a re-spray or a minor refurbishment.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard asked Ms Sturgeon the best question last week, which was ironic given the appalling time he was enduring with his warring colleagues. He noted the child poverty target for  but said: ldquoWhat is her target for  Ms Sturgeon avoided the question. In other words, a Government which believes itself to be on the centre-left does not appear to have a twelve-month target for taking poverty in the right direction.She also got her figures wrong. She estimated that a pound increase to child benefit - a policy within her gt and called for by the opposition - would lt , children out of poverty.

Only He can determine someones journey.\"We believe that it is sending the wrong message to young people. There are plenty of homosexuals from all religions and they need support in the right way. This is not it.\"We heard at the service what many people think about events such as this. The feelings are quite strong but we are not here to confront anyone, we are just sharing Gods word.\"Many people feel that it is not about gay rights but the growing drive for a secular society here on the island.\"Churchgoers on the Isle of Lewis had issued a last-gasp demand for the council to ban the gay pride march in Stornoway.The Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland said it found \"this particular sin . . . especially evil and defiling in the eyes of the Lord\".In a letter signed by Allan MacColl of the Outer Isles Presbytery, the church urged Comhairle nan Eilean Siarto refuse permission for any public gatherings \"which promote the homosexual lestyle, beginning with the event planned [today]\".But the council, who refused to fly the LGBT rainbow flag because it apparently contradicted its flag policy - and also did not have anybody to put it up and take it down at weekends - said all the events would be allowed to go ahead, under the councils equalities policy.Organisers of the event say they have received a lot of support from organisations including NHS Western Isles, Stonewall, the Equality Network and local arts centre An Lanntair.Funds were also raised on the day for the local branch of the Penumbra mental health charity.The organisers say the event is about showing youngsters on the island that they have support as they contemplate issues surrounding their sexuality on the deeply religious island.Flags and balloons were available for people to carry while children were welcome.Some shop fronts were also decorated with the rainbow flag in honour of the event.But while it passed without incident, some marchers made obscene gestures as they passed Rev David Fraser as he carried a placard bearing the words \"repent\" and \"abomination\".Marcher Alison McCabe said she was taking part in support of a -year-old she looks after who is exploring her sexuality.A committed Christian herself, she says the message being sent out by the protestors is the wrong one.She said: \"I am a Christian myself and I believe that God loves everyone. Those protesting can confuse youngsters into believing that He would disapprove.\"I would like to think that the world has moved on and everyone should respect each other regardless of faith or sexuality.\"I was brought up to believe in love your neighbour, I still believe that and that is the message we are trying to get across\".Fittingly, the march took place under a rainbow as curious shoppers looked on as their usual Saturday in the town centre was briefly interrupted by a riot of colour and drag queens.One of the marchers, Jay Butler, says she hopes the townsfolk are supportive of their cause and the deep isions that appear are not as large as in previous generations.She said: \"God loves us all and that is what most people round here believe.\"We are here to embrace change and the majority of people are the same.\"We all should take that path and thats the way it should be\".Susanne Erbida, who is a member of the organising committee, said the group had thought it was ldquotime for the Western Isles to show support for the local LGBT+ community, especially in light of recent events.She explained: ldquoIt is a celebration of acceptance and tolerance, a happy, peaceful and positive event.ldquoWe want to show that it is ok to be dferent, that LGBT+ people do not have to be afraid to go public with their sexuality. That there is nothing wrong with being gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and anything in between.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan backed the event - even though the former Scottish Government minister voted against same-sex marriage in Scotland, saying at the time he \"favours the traditional definition of marriage\" - in contrast to the position of the majority of the SNP government.\"An event like this would probably not have been possible here a few years ago. The fact that it is taking place now is a very welcome sign of how the islands recognise ersity as a strength. In particular, it is a sign of how more and more people recognise the rights of LGBT people,\" he said in a message of support.But the Rev. Graeme Craig, Minister of Stornoway Free Church , said as the march passed by:\"This is a sad day for the islands. Whatever form sexual immorality may take, it is nothing to be proud about.\"This event is sad and shameful. It will point people, particularly the young, in a wrong direction when it comes to identity, relationships and sexual fulfilment. It is worrying that those who struggle with these things will be given the wrong advice.\""},{"url":null,"title":"reinventing-the-wheel-how-historic-water-wheels-are-making-a-comeback-in-scotland","story":"Reinventing the wheel: How historic water wheels are making a comeback in ScotlandPic Alan Richardson Dundee, Pix-ARReinventing the wheel: How historic water wheels are making a comeback in ScotlandPic Alan Richardson Dundee, Pix-ARReinventing the wheel: How historic water wheels are making a comeback in ScotlandPic Alan Richardson Dundee, Pix-ARNow a Scots engineer has ldquoreinvented the water wheel with a new design which could power hundreds of homes.The Carruthers Wheel, created by former maths lecturer turned civil engineer Penelope Carruthers, is the first water wheel to be patented in  years.It is hoped her water wheels could eventually be brought into previously untapped river locations, opening up a new source of renewable energy for Scotland.Carruthers, , is the daughter of renowned engineer David Carruthers, , who was involved in designing the first gas s.She said: ldquoI was looking at old water wheels and as a mathematician I found them rather ugly. I told my father I could do better, and at the very least I could make them mathematically elegant. He dared me to prove it, and I did. I must admit I didnrsquot realise I had invented something new, he spotted it.Unlike mill wheels, the Carruthers Wheel can operate at a range of speeds, dependent on river flow, and could help power remote communities with no access to the electrical grid.Carruthers said: ldquoItrsquos a simple design that can be scaled to any size. A -metre diameter wheel at Bannockburn Falls would supply enough electricity for  Scottish households. A -metre diameter wheel at Lindsayrsquos Mill Weir would supply enough electricity for  Scottish households.ldquoSmaller more domestic sized versions of the Carruthers Wheel may be profitable in those areas of Scotland where there is a limited grid supply.ldquoI canrsquot give names of rivers because wersquore in negotiations, but we are looking at estates and farms, as well as small communities in the Highlands, where getting electricity to areas not attached to the grid would be worthwhile, because they would not need to use as much diesel or oil.The innovative design was tested at Abertay Universityrsquos hydrology lab by senior lecturer Rebecca Wade and her students.Wade admitted she was sceptical when she first received a call from Carruthers three years ago. ldquoWhen somebody phones you up and says theyrsquove reinvented the wheel of course you think hang on a minute, but I was intrigued, said Wade.Carruthers explained to Wade that her wheel can be used directly in river channels, rather than requiring a steady flow from a separate mill stream or mill lade.The Carruthers Wheel can cope with four times the water volume of traditional models thanks to hydro-dynamically designed blades.Wade said: ldquoPenny applied her mathematical understanding to how you might literally reinvent the wheel, reshape the blades, and understand the way in which the forces and action of water was working on the blades to maximise the power output.ldquoItrsquos so exciting that shersquos taken that pure mathematical knowledge and applied it in principal, just in the way the engineers hundreds of years ago were doing.ldquoThis wheel dfers from traditional water wheels in the same way that wind turbines dfer from windmills ndash they are old technology with a modern twist, harnessing natural resources to produce electricity, rather than grinding flour.Following successful lab tests, the team is now investigating potential demonstration sites in the east of Scotland.Wade said: ldquoWersquove been looking at some sites in Dundee and Edinburgh. Wersquove identied several sites that have existing weirs and wersquore speaking to landowners at these sites at the moment.Carruthers has set up a Perth-based Carruthers Renewables Ltd with her father to market the design overseas.She said: ldquoWe have the UK patent. Itrsquos the first water wheel to be patented in  years. We now have to go for the international patent.Carruthers also revealed she only began studying engineering in . ldquoIrsquom in my forties and I was always steered towards maths because thatrsquos what girls did when they showed an interest in science in engineering. Irsquom now gaining from the change in attitudes.ldquoI was just looking at water wheels as a mathematical exercise and itrsquos taken over my le. I now realise I probably should have been a civil engineer from day one.THE RISE AND FALL OF WATER WHEELS IN SCOTLANDThe first water wheels in Scotland are most likely to have been the type known as Norse Mills ndashsimple horizontal wheels with no gearing which were used to grind corn.These mills were in use in Europe more than  years ago, but it is not known when they arrived in Scotland. The Norse Mill at Shawbost on the Isle of Lewis and the Dounby Click Mill on Orkney are restored examples.The Romans brought with them the undershot, or stream wheel, and the overshot water wheel, both of which are vertical water wheels with gearing. One type of Roman mill once seen in Scotland was the tide mill. This was an early method of harnessing tidal power, and a growing number of archaeological remains are being found by drones over our coastline, such as at the Fe Ness ruins.Prior to the industrial revolution the most common form of water wheel in Scotland was the undershot. One example is at the Preston Mill, East Lothian, which was seen in the television series Outlander. Another example of an overshot wheel is the th century New Abbey Mill in Dumfries.In  John Smeatonrsquos scientic paper on water wheels heralded both modern industrial water wheels and the modern profession of civil engineering. By this time there were  mills on the Dighty Water in Dundee, making it Europersquos hardest working river. At the peak of innovation, the increased output of water wheels powered the UNESCO World Heritage Site at New Lanark.With the maturing of steam power, industrial wheels fell into disuse and the last commonly used water wheel, the Pelton Wheel, was patented in . This wheel was further improved by putting the water under pressure and the first high-efficiency water turbine was born."},{"url":null,"title":"it-was-terrifying-what-happened-when-scots-adventurer-aldo-kane-was-locked-in-an-abandoned-nuclear-bunker-for-ten-days","story":"The bunker was rigged with cameras to monitor Kane, , from Kilwinning, and he was asked to carry out daily tests to measure everything from his mood to his reaction time and memory.

Without those three things, I found myself getting to the point where I could see how I could slip into depression or anxietythat isolation had continued beyond the ten days.In day three of the experiment, control of the lights in the bunker was taken away from Kane and he started taking unexpected naps because he had no way of knowing the time of day.By day four, Kane thought he was in day five. His sleeping pattern became more and more erratic, he began to struggle to concentrate on simple tasks and he found it increasingly dficult to exercise.His biological clock effectively moved thirty minutes every day, meaning he was going to bed later and getting up later.In the later stage of the experiment, Kane was woken at am ndash in the middle of his night ndash for the ldquojet lag phase.

If yoursquore asking me to use the term inevitable, I guess yes I would use that. I think wersquore on a journey that will end with independence.On the BBC Sunday Politics Show, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford was unable to saythere would be a second referendum before the next Holyrood election in .He will tell the SNP conference in Glasgow: ldquoThe democratic outrage of Brexit is crystallising the case for Scotland having the full control over its own affairs - no wonder that polls are showing support for independence at record high levels.SNP strategist Kevin Pringle said there was ldquolittle prospect of a referendum before  and the SNP and Greens should try to get a clear mandate at the next election instead.He said it had been relatively easy to secure the referendum after the  Scottish election because then Prime Minister David Cameron assumed it would be a ldquowalk in the park.However, now, with the polls showing consistently strong support for independence, the UK government had ldquono reason to enter into a referendum unless it really has to.He saidpeople could be persuaded to vote for one of the pro-referendum parties, that could translate into support for a Yes vote.Former SNP cabinet secretary Alex Neil also said that Ms Sturgeon would need to secure a new mandate at the  election to secure a referendum and be more radical to win it.The Brexiter said that the party would loseit stuck with plans to rejoin the EU after Brexit.In a newspaper article, he wrote: ldquoSticking with our current policy that an independent Scotland would rejoin the EU would be a huge mistake and could cost us victory in Indyref.Labour MSP Neil Findlay said: ldquoThe First Minister isnrsquot standing up for Scotland by continuing to threaten to ide Scotland with another referendum."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-why-the-polls-arent-as-good-as-independence-supporters-think-they-are","story":"But havenrsquot we been here before  In fact, Irsquom tempted to say wersquore stuck in a bit of a time loop on this one, with the same events happening over and over again. Nicola Sturgeon said on Sunday that support for independence was at historically high levels, but in early September  a YouGov poll showed support for yes at  per cent this weekendrsquos survey for The Sunday Times on the other hand shows that, even with a no-deal Brexit, support for independence would be lower than that, at  per cent. ldquoHistorically pretty much the same might be a better description.However, itrsquos worth taking a look again at exactly what the new polls say. The first one, by Survation, found that,there were an independence referendum tomorrow,  per cent would vote yes and  per cent no. Butthe UK leaves the EU as planned next year, that changes to  for yes and  for no ndash and it changes againtherersquos a no-deal, with  per cent backing yes and  per cent no. The other survey, by Panelbase, found a similar rise:the UK left the EU without a deal, support for independence would increase from  per cent in  to  per cent, while support for the Union would fall from  to .On the face of it, these look like encouraging figures for the SNP, with Brexit pushing support for independence in the right direction. ButI were a Scottish Government strategist, I might privately be a bit worried. In fact, I might even have suggested to my bosses that they keep quiet about the Survation poll, which was commissioned by the SNP, for the simple reason that it doesnrsquot show enough of what they need it to show.The problem is that the surveys do indeed appear to indicate support for the SNP and independence going up. But they also demonstrate something more disturbing for the party, which is that the expected Brexit effect on support for independence simply isnrsquot happening, or at least it isnrsquot happening to the extent that Nicola Sturgeon needs it to.This lack of a signicant Brexit bounce also emphasises the dilemmas faced by Ms Sturgeon. The party members who traipsed into the conference on Sunday and marched through Edinburgh on Saturday are nationalists because their heart tells them to be, but the First Minister takes a much more mathematical approach to the situation, led by the numbers and the probabilities.This is why we saw her shting her position on a second EU referendum at the weekend. The dficulty for Ms Sturgeon is that shersquos a declared supporter of the EU, but the very thing she appears to be fighting ndash Brexit ndash may also offer her the best chance of getting what she really wants: Scottish independence. This means she has to be careful not to fight Brexit too hard, and yet she can see that a consensus is building for a second EU referendum that it would look odd for the SNP to oppose. And so Sturgeon the mathematician nudges forward and says her MPs would support it in the Commons. Their leader there, Ian Blackford, gave the game away when he addressed the subject. ldquoWe will not obstruct a second vote on Brexit, he said ndash hardly the words of a passionate anti-Brexiteer.The weekendrsquos opinion polls throw up similar strategical problems on when to hold a second independence referendum. They do appear to show a small Brexit effect and, anecdotally, Irsquove noticed it among friends and family. Quite a few who voted no in  have told me, over a coffee , that Brexit means they might vote dferently next time. But a hypothetical vote in the pub, or indeed in an opinion poll, is not the same as the real thing, when all the old economic realities would come back. Indeed, they might be even more intense in a post-Brexit world with switherers asking themselves whether, having come out of one economic union , they want to risk coming out of another .The fact that the small rise in support for independence is based on these hypotheticals leaves Nicola Sturgeon with three equally risky options. The first is to call a referendum before the next Scottish elections in  but that would be rejected by Theresa May and probably even Jeremy Corbynhe were PM given the pressure he would face from his Scottish wing. The SNP might be able to gain some traction by fostering a grievance about the referendum being rejected in this way, but option one is essentially a dead end.The second option is one that no one expects to happen ndash a Catalan-style, unofficial referendum ndash but itrsquos the third ndash delay the referendum until after  - that is the most likely. The theory behind it, as far as some SNP strategists are concerned, is that this allows more time for Brexit to convert more no voters. The aim would also be to win the  election based on a promise to hold another independence referendum, which would make it impossible for a Prime Minister to say no.This is Nicola Sturgeonrsquos preferred option ndash she just hasnrsquot said it yet. Indeed, itrsquos never going to be easy for her to say it as long as thousands of nationalists are marching through Scottish cities. She also knows that delaying is risky ndash the Panelbase poll predicts that the independence-supporting parties will lose their majority in  there is also a danger that voters will simply get used to being outside the EU Brexit will become the new status quo.And then therersquos the awkward reality that, whatever your analysis of the new polls, there is still a working majority in Scotland opposed to independence. Ms Sturgeonrsquos gamble ndash as yet undeclared ndash is that this will change by . The problem is that, even in the face of a Tory-imposed Brexit, both sides in Scotlandlook pretty resistant to change."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-claims-that-article-50-can-keep-uk-in-eu-could-just-be-mischief-making","story":"In July  the Convention on the Future of Europe produced its Draft Treaty. This contained Article  and was signed by the President and two Vice-Presidents who were mere figureheads and by the present Lord John Kerr, the Conventionrsquos Secretary General, who was responsible for its production.With a little adjustment it was presented to member states for ratication as The Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe. This was abandoned when referendums in France and the Netherlands produced negative votes. After ious modications and rearrangements together with repeated scrutiny by the EUrsquos own legal experts, the constitution emerged re-named The European Reform Treaty, better known as The Treaty of Lisbon. It is the definitive document governing EU legislation.There is no reference in any of these versions of the treaty to a reversal of notication by a member state that has announced its intention to withdraw from the European Union, except that, after leaving, it is permitted to apply to re-join under the usual conditions for new applicants.Although a group of Scottish politicians is perfectly entitled to require clarication by the European Court of Justice, that body is qualied only to interpret, not alter, laws a treaty is surely even more inviolable Brexit lsquolikely to succeedrsquo, The Herald, October . So why has Lord Kerr, who instigated Article  devised a second referendum described as a road map to a Peoplersquos Vote, for which a new clause would need to be inserted to provide for a unilateral withdrawal of notication and which would almost certainly require a new treaty and ratication by all other member states Immediately after the UK referendum, Prime Minister Theresa May was informed that cherry-picking was inadmissible. Soit is dficult to understand her motive for insisting on the Chequers Plan, it is even more dficult to discern Lord Kerrrsquos for including in Article  the condition of a negotiated agreement between the EU and the departing member state within a time limit ndash with or without extensions ndash and between two such unequally-matched participants.Since a member state has always been entitled to leave the EU, Article  appears to a non-expert to be a recipe for confusion and hostility and Lord Kerrrsquos recent political intervention with regard to the alteration of a treaty that he was largely instrumental in producing, is either a delaying tactic or simply mischief-making.Mary Rolls, Castlegate, Jedburgh.One might think from Mr Russellrsquos letterthat the Labour Party has been arguing for European Economic Areamembership since June , except its  manesto makes not a single reference to this. Certainly, it suggests Labour would have put in place ldquofresh negotiating priorities that have a strong emphasis on retaining the benefits of the single market and the customs union, which is fine, but probably what even Leave wanted just as long as we didnrsquot have to meet the obligations.Instead, Labour has six tests but they are packed full of warm words and uncertainty. One instance is the last test: ldquoDoes it deliver for all regions and nations of the UK . This is not a matter of Yes No, but ldquohow much does it deliver for the regions and nations of the UK  ldquois it enough  and ldquois it distributed equitably round the UK , which in turn beg questions about ldquoenough and ldquoequitably. There is so much wiggle-room in this ldquotest that it tells us nothing.But most risible of all is: ldquoDoes [an agreement] deliver the exact same benefits as we currently have as members of the Single Market and Customs Union , which can only mean that, despite no longer being members of the single market, or the customs union, we would continue to get the benefits we get now as members. If one thing has become clear during the Brexit negotiations, it is that the EU will only grant access in proportion to the degree to which we follow its rules, so the same benefits means approximately the same rules. However, as non-members, for instance in the EEA, we would have limited influence on how these rules evolve in the future.Lastly, Mr Russell asserts thatmore of us had voted for Ed Miliband in  the present shambles would have been avoided, but this is misleading in two regards. First, the  Labour manesto promised an in out referendumBrussels sought to transfer more powers to itself.

Is it doable, though  Labour has no genuine positions on Brexit and appears as likely to split as the Tories are.But Peter Russell argues that Scotland should have no constitutional option other than trail along the same path as is decreed by whomever is in power at Westminster. Given the indference to Scottish sensibilities on Brexit by both Labour and Tory parties, that is a bit rich. Peter Russell also referenced Ed Miliband, who stated during the EU referendum that a dferential vote on Brexit would could lead to the end of the Union.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online. In every case of a branch closing we are committed to providing the best possible range of alternatives.\"Monday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However, it’s becoming harder to find reliable sources and prices are high – and likely to keep rising.The situation has pushed Lynn Cassells and her partner Sandra Baer to look for alternative solutions at their eco-croft near Grantown on Spey in the Cairngorms.The pair bought the -acre property in . Neither had backgrounds in agriculture and the property hadn’t been farmed in  years, so they have had to learn everything as they go along. They currently have six Highland cows,  Jacob sheep, three Oxford sandy and black pigs,  hens and two hives of Scottish honey bees. They also grow their own vegetables.Now they are experimenting with tree foliage as a substitute for hay.Cassells said: “When we decided to farm it was on the basis thatit doesn’t work for nature it doesn’t work for us.” She added: “The idea for the tree hay came from conservation work we’d been doing down south. It’s basically the practice of feeding tree leaves to animals – either fresh or you cut the branches off in full bloom, when the nutrients are at their best, and then dry them to store for winter.”They have also planted a kilometre of hedging made up of goat willow, grey willow and eared willow. As well as providing fresh food and shelter for the animals, sections will be coppiced on rotation and the trimmings dried in the barn. ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4811272.1538992054!/image/image.jpg","title":"joanna cherry indyref2 not necessarily needed for independence","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland would not necessarily have to have a second independence referendum to leave the United Kingdom, a senior SNP MP has said.Instead of having another vote on independence, Joanna Cherry suggested the party’s over-arching goal could be achieved through a “democratic event”.The pro UK camapign group Scotland in Union branded thecomments “dangerous and ill judged”, and called on SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon to “urgently clary” the situation.Ms Cherry raised the possibility as the SNP Annual Conference got under way in Glasgow,also indicating her party could demand a second vote on independence as the price of supporting LabourJeremy Corbyn ousted Theresa May from Downing Street but failed to win an overall majority.• : Nicola Sturgeon: SNP MPs will back new Brexit referendumIn such a situation Ms Cherry, the SNP’s home affairs spokeswoman at Westminster, stressed her party would demand a “high price” from Jeremy Corbyn.A deal to prop up a minority Labour administration could include the removal of Trident nuclear missiles from Scotland, and the granting of a Section  for a second ballot on leaving the UK.But she also said another “democratic event”, such as a general election, could be used as a route to independence.Speaking at a fringe event at the conference, Ms Cherry told party activists: “Our aim is to make Scotland an independent country, but I would remind you that Scotland voted against that in .”She continued: “There has to be a democratic event, and I choose those words wisely, it doesn’t have to necessarily be a referendum, it could be something , like a general election.

Asked whether she thought independence was now “inevitable”, she said: “I think Scottish independence will happen so you’re asking me to use the term ‘inevitable’, I guess I would use that.“I think we’re on a journey that will end with independence. I think Brexit brings the issues around this very sharply into focus.” Ms Sturgeon referred to\u2028“democratic deficit” that saw two-thirds of Scots vote Remain while the UK as a whole voted Leave.“It’s hard to think of a better illustration of that democratic deficit than that,” she said.The UK is due to leave the EU on  March , but issues such as the Irish border and trade have stalled talks.It was hoped an agreement could be reached at the EU summit on  October but officials say it could be later. MPs would then be given a “meaningful vote” on the deal. Ms Sturgeon said she would make her opinion known about the case for another poll after “this phase” of Brexit talks are over.She said: “I will set out what I think the next steps are when we are at the end of this phase of negotiations. “Whether I like it or not – or whether anybody likes it or not – the future of EU-UK relationship is the context in which Scotland will decide that question of independence.”She added: “I will set out my views on the next steps at that stage,that’s when Theresa May comes back with the deal.“It could be later this month, it could be November, it could be December.”\u2028A poll yesterday suggested a no-deal Brexit would see backing for Scottish independence reach  per cent.The Survation survey for the Sun on Sunday also shows support would be a   splitthe break-up goes “as planned”, while support for leaving the UK would be at  per centthere was a referendum tomorrow.Another poll showed backing for Scottish independence would merely grow in the case of a no-deal Brexit – but would not find a majority. The Panelbase survey for the Sunday Times found support for leaving the UK would increase from  per cent in September  to  per cent, while support for staying would fall from  per cent to  per cent.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Scots should not be forced into accepting the result of a second Brexit referendumthey again vote to remain but the majority of the UK vote to leave.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"team leader at shetland home cope ltd ","story":"Are you just the right person to join our dynamic social enterprise, which promotes skill development for people with learning disabilities  We are looking for someone with the following to lead our busy team:Strong leadership and Retail Management experienceA passion for re-use and recycling..COPE Ltd is a charity and social enterprise."},{"url":null,"title":"windrush laxo vidlin ","story":"Offers over £,Originally used as a fishing lodge the property comprises two reception rooms , kitchen   diner, modern shower room, cloak room  store   utility area , on the ground floor, plus three double bedrooms  shower room on the first floor.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parryfrom Gairloch, Ian MacLeodfrom Inverness, and -year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a LuckyBhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.On Saturday th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”Meanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June  showed that % of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only % opposed.  When supporters were asked how they would reactSinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporterssaid they would oppose such a move.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagleWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.- Matt Carthy MEPSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. The Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from am tomorrow. It will feature two  discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible anda unity referendum could be won. Panellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. The  discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. Speakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. It is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. Speaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan KearneyTheannual British-Irish Associationconference convened last weekend inOxford, England.At thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.OnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  TheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.TheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.The RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that partys purportedadherence to good governance’.IanPaisleys misconduct  discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.The DUPjust does not get it!Thatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.Yet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.Andeventhe British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.Inreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.They have already decided the party should notcontest the  local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone.

They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past.

While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

When flying its important to work with the wind to plot the direction and path of a flight.Richard explained that hot air balloons work because hot air rises.By heating the air inside the balloon with the burner, it becomes lighter than the cooler air on the outside.This causes the balloon to float upwards, asit were in water. Obviously,the air is allowed to cool, the balloon begins to slowly come down.Henry Law, owner of The Little Ollie Balloon Team is a member of the retrieve team. He said he was delighted the balloon was able to make contact with Slemish. HISTORIC MOMENT He said: In order for me to retrieve the balloon when it lands, we use very precise location finders and two way radios, however I was able to see the balloon on the side of Slemish.Richard had radioed through to me to say he thought he would be able to make contact and Im so glad our on board GoPro camera captured the historic moment!Expalining how the balloon comes into land, Henry said: We normally like to land in a green field, and always try to seek the permission of the land owner before doing so.We pick non-crop fields and ones without livestock so as to cause no damage or inconvenience.Quite a large area is needed for landing as sometimes the balloon travels along the ground before coming to a stop, therefore the top of a mountain wouldnt have been safe to try to make a total stop.“However, making contact is a great achievement and we are so proud we were able to achieve it.

Although Rubys short le was filled with complex medical needs, it was a le filled with love from her parents Lisa and Andy, little brother Ezra and her wider family. Rubys mum Lisa told the : Ruby had the most precious personality. Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her. Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she done it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family. Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care. This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  . We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us. This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby. So, to remember Ruby on her birthday we are holding a birthday party fundraiser, with all money raised going to the Northern Ireland Childrens Hospice.The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions. The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.Lisa is also planning to launch a blogging website called chasingladybirds in October. This will help Lisa to share her own journey, Rubys le and in turn provide support for other families going through similar experiences.A face book page called Ruby Powells Journey and an instagram page ChasingLadybirds was the prelude to this, giving family and friends the opportunity to be updated throughout Rubys treatments and milestones.Lisa said: Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started. In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.

My son was on the bus on this way into work when he looked over in the direction of the grave, he was shocked to see this massive tree lying on it, he rang me immediately and we headed up to speak to the cemetery staff.”It was during the course of a conversation with Council workers that Mr Osborne was informed that Council employees are not permitted to use chain saws to cut away fallen tress and that they have to wait on an outside agency coming in to carry out the work. He was also told he and his sons wouldn’t be allowed to do the job themselves.Gerry added: “I was shocked to hear this, I was more than willing to come up with my sons and remove the tree myself but I was told I couldn’t.“The cemetery staff have been very helpful and sympathetic, but the tree is still here over two weeks later, and it’s not exactly small. Whatone of us has an accident while we are here tending the grave  I understand that Belfast City Council’s hands are tied, they have been great, but we feel asthis outside contractor who has to carry the work out is in absolutely no hurry to do so, these are ridiculous health and safety rules.“The cemetery itself is beautul and very well kept by the staff, so whoever is responsible for cleaning up this mess needs to take a leaf out of their book and get on with it.”West Belfast Sinn Féin Councillor Stevie Corr said: “Under health and safety legislation council staff are not permitted to use chain saws, they are going through the proper process at the moment, but I know that is of no comfort to the Osborne family who are clearly and understandably upset.“I am a representative on the Strategic Cemeteries and Crematorium working group and I will raise this issue as a matter of urgency, I will also be raising the issue around giving our cemetery and park staff back the skills and authority to use chainsaws to cut down and remove obstructions like this. This is obviously outsourced and we want to bring it back in house again.”Cllr Corr added: “The matter was only raised with me today and we are already working on getting it dealt with.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We are aware of a number of damaged and fallen trees at City Cemetery, caused by Storm Ali. A specialist company is working to clear these but, because of the amount of damage, this is taking some time. However, our contractor is working as quickly as possible and we hope to have all the debris cleared in the near future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"michelin chef clare smyth left family farm in antrim aged 16 to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

There are also proposals to build on Strangford Loughrsquos tourism potential.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin said the local authority was delighted to have reached a key milestone in the development of the Belfast Region City Deal.ldquoWe have in place an investment proposal that focuses on key investment initiatives within our infrastructure, our tourism, our digital connectivity, the skills and education of our people and innovation and digital capability of our businesses, he said.ldquoAs we move through the next stage of negotiations, we will continue to work closely with our partners and stakeholders to ensure that the city deal we secure will deliver on our ambition of a step change in economic performance and more and better jobs for our people.Cllr Murnin said the city deal process had helped to establish what he described as a ldquogenuinely collaborative working relationship across the region and is spearheading a new way of working for councils, the broader public sector, education and business.The local authority and its partners anticipate that an announcement will be made in the forthcoming autumn budget statement, paving the way for them to work up the respective proposals further..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ash shortlisted for music prize  ","story":"THE new album from Ash has been shortlisted for this yearrsquos Northern Ireland Music Prize.Islands was released by Downpatrickrsquos Tim Wheeler, Mark Hamilton and Rick McMurray in May.The event, which will take place on November  at the Ulster Hall, is now in its sixth year and includes theof three categories that formed part of the very first NI Music Awards back in .Over  industry and media cast their vote for the best album of the last  months.

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in . But the wagon overturned, the stone broke and it found its way instead to the Catholic Church in Saul.ldquoI never realised there was an altar stone of St Patrick actually in Saul chapel, John said. ldquoI went three times to try and see it. I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesnrsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Picture by NDJ Macauley Gregory Campbell MP was among those addressed Saturday’s event. The East Londonderry DUP representative talked about the large working-class Protestant population that also suffered from poor housing and other disadvantage when the civil rights movement hit the headlines after the disturbances at Duke Street on October  .“The core demands [of civil rights activists] were met within four months,” he said. “The campaign escalated and very quickly turned into violence by August, within nine months of the October march.”The London based barrister Dr Austen Morgan gave a talk entitled ‘Sectarianism, Rebellion, Socialism’.“We are all products of circumstances,” he said. “I was born to a Derry mother, whose father was a Bogside publican ... My father was from outside Newry, where his father was a small farmer.”    Lord Kilclooney speaks from the floor at the Ulster History Project event on civil rights on Saturday. Picture by NDJ Macauley Mr Morgan said: “My dad had several votes, I bet Gregory Campbell’s parents had none.”Mr Morgan left as a student for England and “came to subscribe to academic Marxism”. “Civil rights in Northern Ireland – but really the inept response of the Stormont government – fascinated some adolescent British student socialists. But all this was universal and cosmopolitan — struggle, workers, peasants and intellectuals, anti-imperialism. It was a million miles from the identity politics, including catholic communalism in NI, which later colonised the campus.”Referring to the late s, Mr Morgan, who is author of Tony Blair and the IRA: The ‘On The Runs’ Scandal, said: “Absolutely nothing justies the IRA emerging, justies their campaign of  years and frankly doesn’t justy the self congratulation going on the Guildhall today.”Dr Graham Gudgin, the economist and former advisor to David Trimble, in his talk ‘Discrimination in Housing and Employment,’ presented statistics which dispute the scale of discrimination against Catholics both before and after .Professor Liam Kennedy gave a talk ‘Civil Rights Movement and the Aftermath’.From the floor, Lord Kilclooney said it was important to challenge claims of discrimination. He pointed out that the Lockwood Committee had actually recommended Armagh as its second choice for the citing of a new university, after Coleraine as first, with Londonderry third.NI business output growth at slowest level in two years Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Saturday’s event was organised by Ulster History Project, which was founded to “promote mutual understanding of the history of Ulster”.Dr Andrew Charles said: “I feel that the conference went very well in that we had a erse range of speakers discussing dferent points from the origins to the aftermath, which was ultimately the beginning of a long terrorist campaign, where over , people lost their lives.”He added: “This was a first for the Ulster History Project and we were very pleased with the level of interest in subject.

policy of the Archdiocese of Armagh and the standards and guidance of the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland, a parish priest of the Archdiocese of Armagh* has voluntarily stood aside from his position because of concerns brought to the Diocese and reported to the Gardaí.”The spokesperson continued: “The information received is historic and relates to a time prior to his time in ministry in the Archdiocese, and indeed prior to his ordination as a priest. “The relevant statutory authorities in Northern Ireland have been informed.”The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin, said the priest is entitled to “the presumption of innocence”.The Church spokesperson said: “The Archbishop of Armagh has asked for prayers for all concerned while stressing that during the period of the investigation the priest, who has voluntarily stepped aside from all his pastoral duties, continues to be entitled to the natural right of every person to the presumption of innocence pending the completion of all relevant State and Church processes.”Northern Ireland needs to get tough on the sort of terrorists who killed dad, says son

Then I made an eagle on number  after I topped it off the tee.\"I stuck my second to about  feet and holed the putt.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They knew the shape of the deal that the Scottish Government would then have negotiatedthe vote had been for independence.ldquoThe contrast between that and the  Brexit vote could not be starker. There was the lie on the side of the bus and nothing more.ldquoThere was no detail then, there is no detail now and it looks increasingly likely that when the UK leaves the EU at the end of March next year, there will still be no detail about the future relationship, and that makes these two situations, in my view, very dferent.The SNP is currently having its annual conference in Glasgow.On #bbcgms @NicolaSturgeon confirms that @theSNP MPs support for a nd #EU referendum across the UK will be unconditional but we will make the case for Scotlandrsquos position to be protected in the event of us being outvoted again @peoplesvote_uk #Brexit #SNPmdash Joanna Cherry QC MPOctober , Speaking on the first day of the gathering, senior SNP MP Joanna Cherry said Scotland would not necessarily have to have a second independence referendum to leave the UK.Addressing a fringe event at the conference, Ms Cherry suggested the partyrsquos over-arching goal could be achieved through a ldquodemocratic event, such as a general election.The pro-UK camapign group Scotland in Union branded the comments ldquodangerous and ill judged.Asked whether she agreed with Ms Cherryrsquos view, Ms Sturgeon told the radio show: ldquoMy view is, as it has always been, that the people of Scotland will decide the question of independence in a referendum. Thatrsquos the party position, that remains the party position.But she continued: ldquoIn defence of Joanna, I think itrsquos a bit rich for the opposition to have a go at SNP members for speculating about how we might be able to express our views on independence in circumstances where, in a fundamentally anti-democratic fashion, we have got opposition parties suggesting that they would block the ability to choose in a referendum.Prime Minister Theresa Mayrsquos official spokesman said: ldquoWe have made our position on this repeatedly clear.ldquoScotland already had an independence referendum just four years ago and voted decisively to remain in the UK.

The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

Alan was a little out, but not by much, writes Justin Rush.  The automation of processes has been one of the hottest discussion topics in . Given that recruitment of staff is a tremendously time intensive process, and one which requires consistency it must surely be a perfect candidate for automation  Well yes… and no. Automation can assist a great deal, but it can’t do everything, not yet anyway.  It is important to know, candidates that are active in today’s employment market are more and more accustomed to using automated chatbots as part of the recruitment process. Non-human involvement equates to zero bias, and therefore reinforces fairness. This is a massive plus point. In a survey by Allegis, % of candidates stated they were comfortable interacting with AI and recruitment chatbots in the early stages of the application process. An even larger proportion - % - were comfortable with chatbots taking care of interview scheduling and preparation.  So what benefits can your business gain from appointing a Recruit-bot Streamlining the applicant journey, by ensuring consistency in the recruitment process and asking screening questions and answering FAQs.Ranking applications, this can be undertaken fairly and quickly based upon candidate submissions. As a result shortlisting is quick and clean.Scheduling assessments and tests, this can be straightforward and without human involvement.   responses, your bot will can exist across your website and all social channels simultaneously.  Your recruitment is now ‘always on’ engaging with potential hires.Repetitive tasks eliminated, creating reports, sending on-line forms or adding candidates to a management system can be a thing of the past.  So automation can really help, especially when volume of applications is a potential issue and you need consistency, or when you are recruiting globally across time zones and don’t want to miss out on a potential inquiry.  Some issues do still remain, despite the efforts of articial intelligence to do it all. In the main, these are the human factors, for example, the assessment of certain competencies that are essential for a job such as team-working.   At present, bots aren’t quite ready to handle the intricate aspects of the recruitment process that require patience and finesse. Answering more specic questions that more specialist professionals may want to ask about a job opportunity, selling the career opportunity or negotiation of salary and terms. These aspects are not part of any readily available algorithm… yet.
