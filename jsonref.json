Ideas such as universal basic income suggest Covid-19 could do likewiseRishi Sunak says the measures he has announced to support the economy are without precedent in peacetime, and he’s right. Never before has the British state agreed to pay the wages of those at risk of losing their jobs. Never before has the government ordered the pubs to shut.The chancellor is not the only one to see the struggle against the coronavirus pandemic as akin to a military operation. Boris Johnson sees this as the summer of 1940, with himself as Churchill.Harking back to the second world war is inevitable given how strongly influenced Britain is by an event that ended 75 years ago, but there are some key differences.The main one is that between 1939 and 1945 the economy was running at full tilt. It took the fight against Hitler to finally eradicate the high unemployment of the 1920s and 1930s. Britain had full employment and would have had rising inflation had it not been for rationing and price controls.Instead of production being scaled up, it is being scaled back. There are a few sectors where activity is rising – food production and healthcare – but those increases will be dwarfed by the lost output elsewhere. Around a third of workers in the UK have jobs in the sectors most affected by the pandemic: retail, restaurants, bars, clubs, hotels, cinemas, theatres, gyms, sport – and they are all closed for business, possibly for months to come. This is not 1940, with factories working round the clock. It’s more like a neutron-bomb attack that targets the people but leaves the buildings unscathed.Nor, unlike 1940, is it just a question of holding on until the Americans get involved. The US was never at threat of being invaded and was able to put its enormous economy on a war footing.But the US is not immune from the coronavirus. On the contrary, it is going to suffer grievously. This is in part because Donald Trump was in denial about the risks, in part because the public healthcare system is so poor, and in part because the social safety net is so weak. Given its size and place at the heart of the global financial system, the US will still have a vital role to play in any recovery, but the number of jobs lost as large parts of the economy go into hibernation is going to be colossal. The country is currently where it was in 1930, when the dole queues were lengthening after the Wall Street crash, rather than in its much more robust state a decade later.Those seeking parallels with the second world war need to broaden their perspective. One way of looking at today’s events is to see the 15 years before the financial crisis of 2007-08 as the equivalent of the years leading up to the first world war. Although this seemed a peaceful, prosperous period – the so-called long Edwardian summer – things were not quite as benign as they seemed. The global balance of power was changing, and there was political unrest and growing class conflict. The first few years of the 21st century, marked by debt-fuelled growth and financial market anarchy were just as delusional.The financial crisis shattered the mood of complacency just as the outbreak of war did in 1914. Winning the struggle in both cases proved harder than expected, and in both cases there was an attempt once victory had been declared to go back to business as usual: balanced budgets and a return to the gold standard in the 1920s balanced budgets, debt-driven growth and financial speculation in the 2010s.But turning the clock back proved impossible. Political discontent and anger grew as economies struggled. Trust in the democratic process frayed. There was little international cooperation.Then, around a decade and a half later in both cases, there was a second shock: the collapse of the financial bubble in 1929 the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. If history is any guide, it is the second shock that makes fundamental change possible.Four big things happened in the 1930s and 1940s. First, the old economics was abandoned. Countries came off the gold standard and states began to pump-prime growth, albeit timidly in most cases. Maynard Keynes’s general theory inspired an entire generation of economists and policymakers.Second, there was an attempt to inject equity into economies through enhanced power for trade unions, more progressive taxation and the expansion of welfare states.Third, work began early on this progressive agenda. In Britain, the Beveridge report, the Butler education act and the white paper on employment all emerged while the second world war was still raging.Finally, there were attempts to build a new international architecture through the creation of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which was intended to avoid the policy fragmentation of the 1930s.How close are we to a repeat of all this? Just consider, a model that has failed not once but twice has been ditched. Governments recognise they have to support their citizens through this.

Whether we will need to go higher than that is something that’s impossible to judge today,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.King said further loans and tax breaks for the self-employed were required and told ministers to ignore the dramatic rise in public borrowing needed to pay for such steps.Saying a recession was inevitable as large parts of the economy are locked down to prevent the spread of the virus, he added: “You cannot blame the government for creating this contraction in activity, it is absolutely necessary. The question is how we help businesses and self employed people survive through to the end of the epidemic.”King’s intervention comes as almost 100 leading economists, including former advisers to the Labour leadership and heads of thinktanks and campaign groups including the New Economics Foundation, Autonomy and Tax Justice UK, signed a letter to the government urging faster and more far-reaching action. More than 50,000 freelancers and self-employed workers have also signed a petition to ministers calling for urgent help, warning that work is drying up and money is running short.Gig economy workers in the Independent Workers of Great Britain union are threatening legal action against the chancellor’s current “discriminatory” policy, while a survey of its members suggested half would keep working if they had symptoms.A spokesman for the Treasury said the government had taken unprecedented action to support jobs and the economy, and added: “We have always said we will go further where we can and are actively considering further steps.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c9ae523f6a8506f7b160edb269f2420d47cd8c/6_445_5006_3004/master/5006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ed7742afc70acd592116bf5ec6c9d75","title":"government considers forcing non essential shops to close reports coronavirus","story":"Debenhams, Nando’s, Primark and more join shutdown list in attempt to stem coronavirusThe UK government is reportedly considering forcing the closure of all non-essential shops in an escalation of measures to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus.It comes as McDonald’s, Nando’s, Costa Coffee, Primark, Debenhams and Waterstones joined the growing list of restaurant chains and retailers closing all their UK outlets as the number of confirmed Covid-19 infections in the UK hit 5,683 and claimed 281 lives.“The Govt considering next steps like closing non-essential retail or whether to start treating people flouting the stay at home advice as acting against the law - all being discussed - huge decisions, nothing final,” the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg tweeted on Monday. A government spokesperson did not immediately comment.Many European countries and US states have already forced the closure of all shops, with the exception of those deemed essential such as supermarkets, other food retailers and pharmacies.The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has repeatedly called on the public to stay at home whenever possible and only venture out for essentials such as food or medicine. On Friday, he ordered all pubs, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and other venues to close. Restaurants and cafes were told they could continue to offer takeaway food and drink.People have been warned against any congregation in groups, even outdoors. Some have been ignoring this advice, prompting calls for Johnson to take stronger action, including closing all non-essential shops and calling on the police to disperse any gatherings.Costa Coffee announced on Monday that 2,700 of its stores would close on Monday night. The chain said it would try to keep a number of its coffee shops within hospitals open and would give free coffee to NHS workers for the next two weeks.“At Costa Coffee our number one priority is the safety of our store teams and customers,” Costa said. “As the need to support social distancing increases, we have taken the decision to temporarily close our stores from this evening, Monday 23 March.”Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.Debenhams also announced on Monday it was closing all of its 140 department stores in the UK and Ireland. The high street chains Card Factory and Moss Bros followed with total closures.Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: “The annual change represented an unprecedented decline in retail footfall that was three times greater than the worst result we have ever previously recorded.” McDonald’s and Nando’s announced on Sunday that all of their respective 1,350 and 400 stores would close.Paul Pomroy, tehe chief executive of McDonald’s UK and Ireland, said: “Over the last 24 hours, it has become clear that maintaining safe social distancing while operating busy takeaway and drive-through restaurants is increasingly difficult. This is not a decision we are taking lightly but one made with the wellbeing and safety of our employees in mind as well as in the best interests of our customers.”Nando’s decided to temporarily close all of its restaurants across the UK and Ireland during the course of Sunday to help limit the spread of Covid-19.A spokesperson said: “Eat in, takeaway and delivery for customers will all stop until further notice and our remaining food will be given away to those who need it most across the community.”In a statement to the stock market on Monday, Primark’s owner, Associated British Foods, said all of its 376 stores in 12 countries would until further notice. There are 189 Primark stores in the UK.Waterstones said it would close its 280 UK branches from Monday. Only hours previously its chief executive, James Daunt, had said the bookstore chain was “no different to a supermarket or a pharmacy” and would stay open during the coronavirus shutdown.Starbucks and Pret a Manger announced the closure of all their UK stores on Saturday.The fashion and homewares chain Laura Ashley, which warned last week that rescue talks had been thwarted by the coronavirus outbreak, formally appointed administrators on Monday. It will close 70 stores permanently on Monday, with the potential loss of 721 jobs, but 77 shops “will be open as normal” .Other chains to have announced the closure of all stores include:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a526ac9ac5a275efd728d0320a23699647c95818/25_340_3460_2076/master/3460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=496b385b73a18d43e0d2359be924438b","title":"more firms cancel dividends as markets sell off continues coronavirus","story":"FCA asks companies to delay financial results for at least two weeks amid coronavirus crisisThe deepening coronavirus crisis has forced UK companies to scrap idend payments to shareholders worth £500m in one day, as heavy selling on global stock markets continued for a fifth week.The total amount of idends cancelled this year so far has reached £1.5bn, as every sector of the economy is being hit by the pandemic and many are cancelling their idends.

The first my generation experienced was the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. We all watched in horror as the months-long media spectacle replayed footage of the towers swallowing airplanes and crumbling into fire and dust. The moment of national solidarity and everyday heroism was brief.The government quickly responded by attempting to achieve two things: one, expanding executive power, and two, transferring public wealth into private corporations. The Bush administration achieved the first by passing the Patriot Act, which built the foundation for what is probably the world’s most expansive surveillance state, but also by setting legal precedents that violated basic constitutional rights and by creating the Department for Homeland Security, with its aggressive constituent agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The second goal was achieved with the “war on terror”, which involved unilateral occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq, and subsequent military forays into many African countries. In Iraq, private security, logistics and reconstruction contractors swallowed up $138bn alone. Since 2001, $5.9tn in taxpayer dollars have gone toward wars (not to mention resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and a foreign policy blackhole that still haunts the Middle East). Neither of these goals addressed the root cause of the crisis, and arguably exacerbated the conditions that led to 911.The second national emergency my generation experienced was the 2008 housing bubble collapse and subsequent recession: the most severe economic meltdown since the Great Depression. Again the federal government, this time under Barack Obama’s administration, sought to exploit the crisis to move vast wealth from the public treasury into private bank accounts. A staggering $14tn was transferred from taxpayers to private hands, including Wall Street executives who used that money to continue giving themselves seven-figure bonuses. One of the largest recipients of bailout money, Citigroup, paid out $5.3bn to employees in bonuses. While the federal government debatably halted a further stock market collapse, they certainly did not address the root cause of the crisis. A mere 11 years later and we are again standing on the edge of a major economic crisis.Ecological devastation, meanwhile, is the quiet crisis amplifier that has persisted through both of these national emergencies and cast a shadow over the whole of my generation. Its latest iteration is the Covid-19 pandemic, whose origins lay in habitat destruction and bioersity loss.Once again, the federal government appears poised to exploit this emergency to expand executive power and move wealth from the public treasury into private bank accounts. As the Nation recently reported, an internal CBP directive empowers the agency to indefinitely monitor and detain anyone suspected of carrying the virus. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has begun a bailout for the oil industry, which could exceed $2.6bn in tax dollars going to oil industry control, and is toying with the idea of an airline industry bailout, which could exceed $50bn.The authoritarian lockdowns in China and Italy may soon arrive to the anglophone world. Seeing self-avowed leftists and liberals praising such draconian reactions is frightening. Anyone who cares about democracy and civil liberty should not welcome such responses. As we witnessed with the authoritarian reactions to 911, emergency violations of civil liberties are not easily rolled back, and often aggregate over time. In the wake of 911, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which gave sweeping powers to the executive branch. In 2012, Obama signed an expanded version into law, which gave the president the power to “hold iniduals, including US citizens, in military detention indefinitely”, which means for life. We must reject such authoritarian measures wholly, no matter who says they’re “necessary”.The fact is, neither expanding executive power nor redistributing wealth upward will save lives or address the root cause of the crisis. In fact, both the oil and airline industries are accelerating the ecological devastation at the heart of this pandemic. As ecological collapse continues to unfold, more and more emergencies like this will occur with greater frequency and intensity. Now is the time to break out of the recurring pattern in which national responses not only fail to solve the problem, but even exacerbate the original cause, while transferring wealth from taxpayers to already-wealthy, well-connected executives. Instead, now is the time to implement a set of standards for what constitutes a response that puts the common good at the center.In the case of this virus, there are plenty of good ideas already being discussed that would do exactly that. Instead of moving public wealth into private corporations, the government should be doing the opposite.The first step to containing this virus is handing out cash to every American to fund their ability to self-isolate without having to go to work. A basic income of, at minimum, subsistence rate would achieve this. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has called for implementing an emergency universal basic income, while presidential candidate Bernie Sanders suggested delivering a monthly $2,000 check to every household to deal with lost income.Providing universal healthcare, both during the virus flareup and after, would also go a long way to containing its spread and reducing its seasonal intensity the for-profit system is probably exacerbating the spread of the virus. Subsidizing or even nationalizing essential goods and services like utilities, pharmaceuticals and distribution of basic necessities could also help contain the virus and reduce its negative long-term impacts, and ensure that those services remain available to all. The Trump administration has (surprisingly) ordered the Department of Housing and Urban Development to halt evictions and foreclosures temporarily. Taking that further and reforming or eliminating them, even past the worst of the pandemic, could help soften conditions leading to virus spreading in the future.Interim support for local services, like small businesses and charities, would also help keep local infrastructure intact beyond the most intense phases of social isolation. Dismantling the prison industrial complex and deeply reforming the justice system would help as well. The US has the highest incarceration rate and absolute prison population in the world. Abolishing the institution would go a long way toward reducing the impact of highly infectious viruses, given that prisons are “the perfect incubators” for coronaviruses. Finally, bypassing intellectual property laws with regard to vaccine development, and preventing anyone from limiting access for private profit, would also be important, both now and beyond the pandemic.Of course the best thing we can do is halt the twin ecological and climate crises that are now driving so many existential emergencies like the Covid-19 pandemic. But, in the meantime of attending to that herculean task, the least we can be doing is agreeing on a set of responses that reject authoritarian exercises of executive power and the further enrichment of the already wealthy at the expense of the public. Instead, we should be responding to such national crises by saving lives and fortifying the common good. Through a series of compounding national emergencies, a benevolent response would be the first my generation has ever witnessed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4a108e8495fa88bde4b2e5a6b5a27aba90d87c4/0_344_5611_3367/master/5611.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f36656dfd56289d434f757d9c44b61e5","title":"covid 19 activists helping elderly vulnerable people political","story":"Activists are turning to helping elderly and vulnerable people locally. It’s a political model that we should stick toI’m in two groups that have sprung up spontaneously online, for neighbours to help each other out: one on Facebook, the other on WhatsApp. Neither is remotely political, in the sense that nobody is discussing the government or its deficiencies. And you would never distinguish between the two in terms of generosity or creativity: there are mental health nurses offering Skype calls, people offering parking spaces and dog walking. And above all, and always, support for self-isolation: any shopping, any errands, anything at all, to maintain this state of confinement that only a fortnight ago would have felt impossible, and still feels so unnatural.The WhatsApp group, though, was organised by the local Labour party, and this is how it shows: it was organised by wards, which are much smaller than the entire borough – 10,000 people rather than 300,000. The ward immediately split into subgroups of two or three streets, and the leafleting began.This is what you always remember from a Labour childhood, the endless leafleting, the crushing sense of futility at popping another 300 flyers telling people how seriously your candidate takes buses. In a time of crisis, it is transformed: you don’t want to create an online community of people who all use the same social networks. You want to tell everybody. There is a huge amount of embedded knowledge about the process of activism, how to get round an estate where there’s an entry code, what phrases to use in the leaflet, how big the font should be. All guardedness is jettisoned, with people freely giving out their numbers and addresses to strangers.There is a lot of regular, worldly expertise – a nurse, a shrink and a vet on one scabby road – who can scotch operational rumours that circulate quite freely on Facebook (“wear gloves”, the round robins say but gloves are the same as hands, in hygiene terms. And at least hands, you can wash). You could predict from miles away that there would be a lot of local knowledge, but it is still so surprising in its particulars – there’s a nunnery in the road perpendicular to mine, which everyone has always known, because of the nuns. But it was the activists who knew that it was also a hospice, housing 176 terminally ill people, and it was that tiny local support group that started putting together a rota for checking what they need. Not every member knows every other in a Labour ward, but there’s one person who everybody knows, and she (it’s always a she) carries a lot of weight, maybe because she doesn’t swing it. She can shoot down a misjudged idea with an emoji. In this group of very mild, sometimes online-only acquaintanceship, there is a huge amount of love.Hoaxes and hysteria are the condiments of any emergency: presumably there’s malice in their creation, which is depressing, but I understand why people believe and spread them. We are in this insistently eerie state of constantly checking the news, only to find it hasn’t changed, except to worsen. This puts us all in a passive, suspended state. If you can find movement in events, you can think yourself ahead of them. Hence this slew of rumours: the army’s on the streets, the shops are running out of food, this guy knows a guy who works in RBS, and he says national quarantine by 5pm, my friend who’s a nurse says don’t drink anything with ice in it, and hold your breath while counting to 10. They spread pretty much unchecked on open forums, but are shot down with precision in tighter groups.It is not relevant what the politics are of this ground army it could be any group, the Women’s Institute, the RNIB. What is relevant is that the ground army exists, and is confronted with a challenge it is uniquely placed to meet. The moral act would be for all Labour leadership candidates to come out and say: the election will go ahead, it’s all online, but the campaign is over. You all know who you’re voting for. Redeploy the phone-bankers to talk about other things cross-pollinate ideas show solidarity think about more organised ways to support the frontline workers and people who are isolated shoot the breeze. The membership base has been the site of deep connections, knowledge and trust for many decades, counterpoised always by the amount of energy it spent talking about, and finding differences within itself. Members have already relinquished that second pastime entirely, and the leadership candidates should do the same.We already know, I think, that we’re not going back to who we were before: a nation that could wind itself up into bitter hatreds over flimsy concepts, that took “pragmatism” to mean economic constraint over human generosity.“Concentrate on the future” is what people say under lockdown, in France, in Italy, when pressed for advice on how to stay sane. They don’t mean, “think about the time when the bars are open again, when we can hug one another for no reason” they mean, when we rebuild it, what do we want life to look like?Politics has already gone far beyond our previous understanding of it as a set of performative oppositions and set itself to the urgent question: now that we suddenly know how much we care about one another, what action does that demand? In the immediate term, the answer is very obvious, counterintuitive and painful: it’s to stay the hell apart.In the longer term, the question is more searching. What can we build, together, to keep each other safe, not just from disease, but from want, from despair, from solitude? These questions, I think, will collapse old party isions. After this brutal lesson in what matters, we will have a keen eye afterwards for what doesn’t. Labour can model that now – given that it just isn’t possible to cooperate and compete simultaneously, it must choose cooperation. Everything else can wait."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bba0ca37ad6f0b51fe0d7d9f77932c38b9b9e04e/0_0_5126_3075/master/5126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a127d37937e6dc97f7d4ec44cf99772","title":"your coronavirus sabbatical starts now dont let it go to waste","story":"Stuck at home? Here’s how you can use quarantine to redesign your lifeAll over the world those who care about their health are hunkering down at home. In other circumstances, this might be a boon, an unexpected opportunity to chill-out rather than set off for yet another day in the frantically-paced 21st century. But when you are looking at weeks, maybe months of this, you do start to ask: how on earth am I going to fill my time? I have a few ideas …Start by thinking of the range of things you would like to do: from tidying out the junk drawer in your kitchen to repainting your dining chairs to reading À la Recherche du Temps Perdu or starting to write your own novel. Put each idea on a spreadsheet, scoring them 1 to 5 by such factors as practicality, seriousness of intent, length of time needed, possibility of completing the task alone and so on. You might have 30 possible projects but once you’ve put them through your filter, about five would be a good total. Goals should be achievable, maybe not easily, but you don’t want to set out for something so gargantuan that failure is inevitable.For while it’s good to come up with self-improving ideas for your coronavirus sabbatical, you need to keep in mind self-compassion too. Don’t beat yourself up over this. It’s not a competition. This is a difficult time for everyone don’t make it any harder.If you are continuing to do your job from home, be up and showered at your usual time don’t stay in pyjamas or work from bed. You want to stay sharp and focused. If your time is your own, you have more flexibility, but most people find that they get much more done if they set themselves a timetable with breaks every 45 minutes or so. It’s also a good idea to shuffle your tasks. After all, you have plenty of time, so you don’t have to finish everything before starting something new..Some projects could entail working with others remotely. Learning a language for example. A friend or tutor might agree to have language lessons with you by phone. You could move your book group online, or you could start a new, smaller one with the specific aim of reading positive, encouraging texts no more Handmaid’s Tale for you.You might even come up with a new business idea. One friend of mine Suzanne Noble has a hit with her Corona Concerts on Facebook, which she started when her London gigs as a blues singer were cancelled.Staying in contact with others is key. As therapist Mark Bailey wrote on welldoing.org, “We are social beings and we need interaction to be psychologically healthy. Facetime and Skype are frankly godsends in these times so use them – not just for work but for friends, acquaintances and family. Focus conversation on other things in life, not just coronavirus!”If you are able to get out of your home and safely go for a walk or run, do just that. But, increasingly, that’s not encouraged. Use YouTube videos for exercise tips or yoga classes haul out your skipping rope, run up your stairs. If you’ve got a standing desk, use that for some of the time.If you can’t move about much, don’t spend too much time in your kitchen or you risk something less dangerous than coronavirus, but unpalatable all the same: packing on the pounds. Drinking lots of alcohol may also seem like a good idea at the outset, but it will soon have the same effect as the food.All the irritating things in your life? Your messy desktop, unfiled documents, ancient bank statements, photos, schoolbooks: this is the time to deep clean your administrative life. Be brutal, go for the clean slate.Your wardrobe too would probably benefit from the sort of critical analysis that large tranches of free time will afford. Follow the time-honoured advice of separate piles: throw out, recycle or charity, mend or clean, keep and wear.Spend some of your time creatively. What better time to get Harriet Griffey’s Write Every Day to kickstart creative writing? Or dare yourself to draw, even if you haven’t since you were 12. Or sew, or knit? Or write poetry?Your might also imagine that this almost unbelievable health crisis is the beginning of something new. A kind of re-set, where we all give ourselves more time to reflect and ponder what life is all about, and how happy we are to actually be alive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7c80dc7b68f3545ab9937dd9952eff1d4173ebc/0_489_4802_2880/master/4802.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77b12f50858fc9f594dd5453eb97641e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of relief","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘relief’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘relief’.Share your photos of what relief means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 25 March at 10am.

Keep your family at home if at all possible. Leave the few spaces available for those that truly have no alternative.“My appeal to companies and other employers: please do not interpret the key workers lists liberally for your own ends. Do not put profit over people.”Government guidance, issued on Friday, listed the relevant occupations and children with “at least one parent or carer” who is considered critical to the Covid-19 response “can attend school if required”.The National Education Union criticised the Department for Education’s guidance as not being clear enough and called for an urgent clarification, saying a strong message was needed to let parents know their child should only be at school if there was no alternative. Dr Mary Bousted, the NEU’s joint general secretary, said teachers were on the frontline. “They can only do this vital work if everyone plays fair,” she said.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said: “Tomorrow, all schools will be closed except for vulnerable children and those of critical workers.

This will help to halt the spread of the virus, protect the NHS and save lives.“We will be closely monitoring what is happening in schools and will ensure they get the support they need in the weeks and months ahead.”The erging approaches to school closures may stem from the considerable uncertainty around the extent to which children are playing a role in spreading Covid-19.“It seems most plausible to me that they are being infected but are at low risk of developing disease,” said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We know that for flu, children are important transmitters of infection, which is the basis for the flu vaccination programme directed at children, but we do not know yet how important they are as transmitters of coronavirus. So closing schools would be based on the assumption that they do make an important contribution to transmission.”Rates of various illnesses are seen to rise and fall at the start and end of school terms. School holidays were thought to have led to a plateau in the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Also advised hygiene and social distancing measures, such as hand washing and reduced physical contact, just aren’t very effective in a primary school playground setting. So there is the potential for schools to act as a local fountain of infection for the surrounding area.“Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they’re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats,” said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.This uncertain science has to be carefully weighed against the certain disruption and cost of school closures, including taking large numbers of doctors and nurses out of the workplace, and unintended consequences such as grandparents, who are among the most vulnerable, taking on childcare and facing greater exposure.One primary school head said it was vital numbers of children be kept low to allow social distancing. Chris Dyson, the head of Parklands primary school in Seacroft, Leeds, which has 360 pupils, has split his staff into three rotas, allowing 14-day breaks away from the classroom to allow self-isolation.Jules White, the head of Tanbridge House School in Horsham, West Sussex, a secondary school with 1,600 pupils, was expecting between 90 and 100 pupils.From his informal network of school leaders and teachers, as coordinator of the WorthLess? lobbying campaign over school funding, White said it was clear “schools are really busting a gut”.Simon Kidwell, the head of Hartford Manor primary school in Cheshire, and who sits on the NAHT national executive, said since the key workers list came out he had been plugging the message to parents”: “Is your job corona critical?”He said: “First I briefed all the parents in the playground. I told them what our stance was. I used language like ‘last resort’ and ‘your family are safer’ if the social distancing is in their own home, rather than coming into our child care. We’ve had our phones on between 10am and 3pm over the weekend.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said staffing would be lower because more will have to self-isolate or will become ill over the weekend. Parents would need to be prepared that not every child will get a place.“We would appeal to parents who consider themselves to be on the key worker list only to send their child to school if there is no alternative and to treat this emergency provision as a last resort.“We would ask them to understand that it may not necessarily be possible to provide a place for every child and that schools may have to prioritise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/614f6f3c74ecba810de73496f842b6afa05f18ae/0_207_6252_3754/master/6252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f58bdddb227f9c5d502734fc1d4207f9","title":"let your kids get bored emergency advice from teachers on schooling at home","story":"Suddenly the children are at home. How do you even start to educate them yourself? Here are expert tips from teachersSchool may have closed for the foreseeable future, and all exams cancelled, but children still need to be educated and entertained – as well as reassured. Many schools plan to send work home and there are lots of free resources available via online platforms such as BBC Teach. But meanwhile, how do you even start home learning when this is all so new? We asked teachers for their emergency advice.“Great learning only happens when children feel happy, safe and secure. Provide your children with reassurance and love.” Jules White, headteacher at Tanbridge House school, Horsham“Children need normality, familiarity and structure. So keep to a routine. It makes home schooling easier and helps children to realise this is not a holiday, and that teachers are expecting learning to take place to some degree.” Lillie Rosenblatt, teacher at Brookfield primary school in Camden, London“Let your child create their own structure or timetable for the day, combining their ideas and home learning. If they try and schedule double PlayStation every morning, then it’s probably time for parents to step in, but give them the option first. I think a lot of parents will be impressed with the outcome.” Joanna Conway, headteacher, Whitegate End primary school and nursery, Oldham“In communities like mine, there are not a lot of PCs, laptops and other tech in the home that allow pupils to access learning platforms. My advice is let your kids have a holiday and enjoy themselves until they get bored. Then they will want to get on to learning they have been set. The homework is there not to improve standards but to ease boredom.” Chris Dyson, headteacher, Parklands primary school, Leeds“It will be important for friends to stay in virtual contact with each other as long as interactions are friendly and supportive – but avoid an unhealthy overreliance on screen time in all of its guises. Too much screen time has very negative effects on physical and mental health and it disrupts sleep patterns as well. Variety is key: exercise, reading a great book and learning a new skill are all suitable ways of avoiding the sheer monotony of a TV and computer screen.” Jules White“Continue to practise essential English and maths. Review fundamental maths skills such as number bonds, times tables, ision facts and additionsubtraction strategies. Encourage your child to write for pleasure about what they’ve done that day, or make a comic.” Jordan Bickel, Grand Avenue primary and nursery school, Surbiton“Children need to have a plan or timetable right from the start, and to stick to it using a timer. But activities should not just be solely English and maths-based. Making learning fun is vital – so baking, painting and getting out and about in the garden are essential to reduce boredom.” Emily Proffitt, headteacher, Tittensor first school, Stoke-on-Trent“Listen to your child. Enjoy hearing your child explain what they are being asked to do, and the challenges they face.” Jules White“It’s vital that children get downtime to be independent and relax. We are encouraging our pupils to write to each other, giving them a purpose but also helping them feel less isolated.” Emily Proffitt“Whether it’s reading to themselves, a parent, a sibling or even a special animal friend, it’s essential children continue to read. Reading anything counts.” Jordan Bickel “The younger the child, the less time they can sit and learn for, so frequent breaks are important for productivity.” Lillie Rosenblatt“I’d recommend around two hours’ learning in total a day for children in key stage 1, which covers reception to year 2. That should include arts and crafts, and hands-on activities. Children in key stage 2, which covers year 3 through to year 6, would be able to do more: about three to four hours. But again, that should include PE activities and more creative tasks as well.” Jordan Bickel“Encourage your child to research something that is of interest to them and show their learning with a creative project. This could be making something with play-dough, junk modelling, papier-mache or a presentation. Let your children experiment.” Jordan BickelMovement breaks – such as dancing to music, performing animal walks or playing Simon Says – provide children with sensory feedback and offer them a chance to “reset”. “If fast movement breaks aren’t working, slow it down by doing wall or chair push-ups or squeezing hands, shoulders or legs. Find what works for your child. It will really help with learning and focus.” Lillie Rosenblatt“There are so many benefits to outdoor learning: children develop an appreciation of the world around them, enhance their solving skills and increase their sensory skills, not forgetting the benefits for physical and mental health. Maybe you could learn about all the plants and trees near your house, or create your own outdoor circuit and do a daily workout together. Doing something physical keeps our mind healthy too.” Joanna Conway“Positive constructive praise that targets effort, behaviour and specific aspects of a child’s work is much more powerful than just saying ‘well done for completing your English’. Lillie Rosenblatt“Enjoy the extra time together. Create some artwork, a board game, make a meal together, do a jigsaw, write a song or put on a production, a dance or make a video. Maybe you could send it to relatives to cheer them up. I would also recommend sharing a ‘family gratitude’ each day.” Joanna Conway“Try to keep to your timetable as much as you can. It will really help you to vary what you study at home and your teachers are more likely to be online at those points in the day to help you specifically.” Niamh Sweeney, teacher, Long Road sixth-form college, Cambridge“Search the web for free resources for your subject. There are numerous websites now offering premium content for free during the crisis.” Alex Goldsmith, maths teacher, the Alleyne’s academy, Stevenage“Keep a journal. Each day, spend six minutes writing about the following: three things you are grateful for, how you plan to make today great, a good deed you will do that day, how you plan to improve yourself and, at the end of it, some great things you experienced that day.” Chris Hirst, Stretford high school, Manchester“Try not to worry about the situation. As soon as schools and colleges know what is happening about college and university applications, we will let you know. Take a break from social media – and don’t forget to wash your hands.” Niamh Sweeney“Read a book you haven’t read before. Take a photography challenge: document your time in isolation in photographs (your mood, what you did, how you felt). Calculate the value of Pi to as many decimal points as you can. Learn a dance step or a magic trick from the internet. Make a meal from whatever you have in the cupboards – extra marks for putting together a totally original, mad or weird recipe. Go online to kids.guinnessworldrecords and find a World Record that you can try to break at home.

Not to denigrate the loss of life, but this might give us some hope from something terrible. To see what can be achieved.”Monks, the former chair of the UK government’s science advisory committee on air quality, said that a reduction in air pollution could bring some health benefits, though they were unlikely to offset loss of life from the disease.“It seems entirely probable that a reduction in air pollution will be beneficial to people in susceptible categories, for example some asthma sufferers,” he said. “It could reduce the spread of disease. A high level of air pollution exacerbates viral uptake because it inflames and lowers immunity.” Agriculture could also get a boost because pollution stunts plant growth, he added.The World Health Organization describes NO2 as “a toxic gas which causes significant inflammation of the airways” at concentrations above 200 micrograms per cubic metre. Pollution particles may also be a vector for pathogens, as well as exacerbating existing health problems. The WHO is now investigating whether airborne pollution particles may be a vector that spreads Covid-19 and makes it more virulent.NO2 levels also dropped in South Korea, which has long struggled with high emissions from its large fleet of coal-fired power plants but also from nearby industrial facilities in China.The country has avoided putting entire regions under lockdown but is meticulously tracing and isolating suspected coronavirus cases.The changes over northern Italy are particularly striking because smoke from a dense cluster of factories tends to get trapped against the Alps at the end of the Po Valley, making this one of western Europe’s pollution hotspots.The source is not yet clear. One possibility is a slowdown of activity in Italy’s industrial heartland. Another factor is likely to be a reduction in road traffic, which accounts for the biggest share of nitrogen dioxide emissions in Europe.Peuch said satellites were now starting to pick up similar signals in other European cities that are entering into lockdowns, though the data needs to studied over over a longer period to confirm this is a pattern.Although the UK is more than a week behind Italy in terms of the spread of the disease and the government’s response, roadside monitors already show significantly reduced levels of pollution at hotspots such as Marylebone in London.“What I think will come out of this is a realisation - because we are forced to - that there is considerable potential to change working practices and lifestyles. This challenges us in the future to think, do we really need to drive our car there or burn fuel for that,” said Monk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e13596fd51e00e7a5fb86705d3ba8711a42ede61/0_0_3456_3456/master/3456.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=181507ec495efebac1d6a437e1a35737 1440w","title":"as australia closes all cinemas china reopens 500 venues","story":"Ticket sales slow as film theatres start to reopen in China, just as Australia orders shutdown of cinemas due to coronavirusChina’s cinemas are gradually opening once more for business across the country, although ticket sales remain slow.As the coronavirus outbreak begins signs of receding, more than 500 screens – of the country’s 70,000 – are once again showing films.On Sunday, the Australian federal government ordered the closure of cinemas across the country, with effect from noon on Monday – and with no end date set.In two Chinese provinces, Fujian and Guangdong, no tickets were sold on Friday, and the total revenue was less than $2,000 (£1,725).

He goes on to quote the Roman poet Belli, whose sonnet praises both broth and boiled chicken, and the medical school of Salerno, which for decades has suggested that fresh eggs, generous amounts of wine, succulent broths and simple focaccia are best way to stay efficient and strong.Having promised efficient and strong, the chapter goes on to describe the family of broths thickened with semolina, cheese and egg or stracciatella, so-called because of the wispy stracci that form with heat and whisking, and that then sit suspended like cumulus clouds in the broth, soothing and invigorating. I am sold on this – we need all of these things – so I head out on to the extremely bright and quiet streets of Rome, now a city suspended, to buy chicken.While some people don’t differentiate between stock and broth (the American food writer James Beard was emphatic that they were the same thing), I do, especially when it comes to chicken and beef, and this is based entirely on unscientific habit. The difference between (my) stock and (my) broth is that the former is richer, made with roasted bones and cooked for longer, whereas broth begins with raw meat and is cooked for less time.Stock was what I knew growing up, Mum boiling the carcass of a roast chicken along with the scrapings from the roasting tin, any bones left on our plates and vegetables. The pan would simmer on the hot plate for a couple of hours, or in the oven for more, emerging as a dark gold liquor that steamed up the windows, then congealed into a wobble as it cooled. Looking back, it wasn’t even a case of choosing between the two words: stock was stock, and the only broth we knew was Scottish and came in a tin. It was in Italy that I learned to make the broth known as brodo or brodino. I also learned about dado, a cube of broth or spoonful of granules with wondrous powers, but that is another column.My best chicken broth comes from boiling a whole boiling fowl, or gallina, which provides several litres. Week-in-week-out, though, I use two legs and a wing, putting them in a pan along with a carrot, two sticks of celery, a fistful of parsley stalks, a bay leaf, five peppercorns, an onion cut in half and two litres of cold water, all brought to a boil, then reduced to a steady simmer, skimming the surface from time to time. After 50 minutes of simmering, you have a pale yellow, gently flavoured stock to be strained and salted. You also have a little poached meat that has given up some but not all of its flavour. Pulled from the bone, this pale poached meat is one of my favourite things to eat, trumping both roast and fried chicken, especially when pinched with flakes of salt, eaten with lemon mayonnaise and salad, or squashed between two slices of white bread.As a child, I loathed being told to drink or eat up because it would do me good I didn’t care if it did me any good, I cared only that it tasted good. In the case of Mum’s stock, I took it entirely for granted. Now I don’t: if you eat meat, there is no doubt that chicken broth, with or without the wisps, is the most soothing and nourishing of foods – the mother of foods, for every day.As is always the case, there are as many versions of stracciatella as there are cooks. I follow Livio’s recipe, but substitute the nutmeg for lemon.1.5 litres chicken broth or stock3 eggs3 tbsp semolina3 tbsp grated parmesan1 tbsp finely chopped parsleyNutmeg or lemon zest (you choose)Lift out one ladleful of broth and set aside to cool. Bring the rest to a boil.In a bowl, whisk the eggs, semolina, parmesan and the cold stock you set aside before. Add the parsley and the lemon zest or nutmeg, and whisk again.Once the broth is boiling steadily, add the beaten egg mixture and whisk vigorously so that the egg forms into small rag-like flakes. Reduce the flame to moderate and cook, still whisking, for another two minutes, then serve immediately."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0deac0287f2ac38d8e170a90a1d1c5e0fbaa1641/0_204_4131_2478/master/4131.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91910ab44ad028a3555be1f75d397d46","title":"observer food monthly 20 best noodle recipes","story":"The wonder of the world’s favourite food from our recipe hoard to yoursNoodles: the perfect lunch or dinner via Italy, Spain and China.

Finely chop the wild garlic and put it in a bowl with the butter and lemon zest. Add the garlic, mash everything together with a fork and then season to taste. Lay out a piece of clingfilm, shape the butter into a sausage shape in the middle, wrap tightly and refrigerate for least 30 minutes to harden.Once the butter is firm, pour the beaten eggs on to a deep plate, then pour the flour and the breadcrumbs on to two others. Put the chicken breasts on to a board flat side down, stick a sharp knife into the fat end and slice open a small pocket be careful not to slice all the way through. Cut the butter into eight slices and stuff a couple of slices of butter into each pocket, squeezing the edges together to re-seal.

But afterwards Hannah, now 31, could not remember which platform, or even the station, she had seen the man on.She looked out for him for weeks. Then, after leaving her office early one day, she saw him again – at Finsbury Park station. Next time, she promised herself, she would ask him out.The next day, there he was again.It was busy on the platform, so she hung back, steeling herself to go up to him. Ten minutes passed – and three or four trains. Imran noticed her still standing there on the platform. “You still here?” he asked.It was not “the most confidence-building thing” that has ever been said to her, Hannah remembers – but she seized her chance.“I said to him: ‘Are you a single man?’ He was very taken aback and said: ‘What, me?’ I thought: ‘Well, who else am I talking to?’”Imran did not have a working phone – which Hannah would come to know as typical of his haphazard approach to comms – so she gave him her business card.Imran, now 44, says he had never been asked out at work before. “It was a big surprise – a nice surprise.”He had noticed Hannah on the platform: “I thought she was gorgeous.” He also thought she might be “dangerous”. “To be honest, I was a bit worried. I was thinking: ‘What does she want to get with me for?’”At the time, Imran had been single for seven years, busy raising two children – then aged 16 and 17 – from a previous relationship. Dating had not been a priority.Their first date was a few days later at a pub near the station – “not even a nice pub”, says Hannah. She still ribs Imran about meeting her round the corner from where he worked, so his colleagues wouldn’t see them.She had worried there would be awkward silences, but they were still talking at closing time. It came as “a bit of a shock” to learn that Imran had two teenagers, Hannah says – “I took a huge gulp of my gin and tonic” – but it did not put her off. After the pub closed, Imran took Hannah to his favourite local chicken shop, and they ate sitting on a bench outside a club.It was “relaxed and convenient”, rather than glamorous, says Hannah – but they went on only one more “datey date”. “It became quite domestic quite quickly.”She remembers a point about six months in when Imran said he would be gone for an hour, then got caught up in errands and family, and went off-grid for the day – “a typical Imran thing”, she now knows. “I realised, as I was imagining these terrible scenarios, that I loved him, and that was why I was so irrationally worried and upset.“It all came out in this blubbery mess. I thought there was no way that this man was going to tell me he loved me, too – that he was far too guarded – but then he did.”A little over a year after their first date, just before Christmas, Hannah moved in with Imran and his younger son in Islington. “The house just feels better,” says Imran.He describes his relationship with Hannah as “two worlds meeting”, but they share values and like to spend time in the same way. He says she is intelligent, articulate, caring, empathic. “I like everything about her. She’s so good at everything she does, she doesn’t take any shit – I like that a lot.”Hannah says Imran is open-minded, patient, forgiving – “the yin to my yang”. “He’s got bundles of tolerance and compassion where I’m quick to be impatient, annoyed and judgmental.

Then Twitter, Instagram and Facebook followed. When I got home, I decided to keep culling …‘It always happens when you least expect it.” Or so the adage goes the romantic notion that the job of your dreams or the love of your life will appear when you’re not trying. In my life, this does not ring true: every job I’ve landed I tried very hard to get, and even in the realm of love there has been work to nurture and maintain it.But when it comes to better mental calm, it did arrive when I least expected it, as an unintended consequence of a tiny tweak: turning notifications off on my phone.I discovered this life-transforming trick while on holiday in Bali. I had already muted notifications related to work (email pings, Slack, Gchat), but still found myself woken up in the middle of the night by the phone vibrating incessantly from conversations happening in the UK across WhatsApp and social media. Next, I switched off all notifications for Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. I also silenced WhatsApp, which – with all the various group chats – could easily alert me more than 100 times a day.When I got back to the UK, I saw no reason to put any of these notifications back on, be it work or social. Life was still busy and hectic, but less harsh, somehow. It was as if someone had turned the volume down on my life ever so slightly.I decided to cull even more notices. The news blasts were the first to go: I did not need to be notified hourly about a worsening pandemic that I was helpless to do anything about. Then I disabled the notifications from the dozens of fitness apps that “remind me” (read: chide me) that I have not exercised that day, which I already know. Notifications of store discounts, gone holiday deals, goodbye. One by one, as a notification popped up on an app, I got rid of it, until just a few crucial ones remained (eg my period tracking app and the one with transport updates about my commute). Rather than my phone buzzing every 20 minutes, it was once every few days.I’d love to say that doing this brought down my overall screen time that without prompting I did not look at my phone as much. I’d love to say that the evils of the blue screen – their alleged impact on our sleep and keeping us sedentary – are now banished from my life, and that instead of hungrily reading articles or watching YouTube videos of Gordon Ramsay being mean to restaurateurs, I flick through history books and go for long walks. But turning off notifications did not give me a personality transplant. My internet-centric behaviours, long programmed inside me, did not wither away.Rather, what it did was stop the feeling of shock associated with being buzzed by the world. A notification, like a telephone call out of the blue, essentially says: “Stop everything and look at me right now.” It’s disconcerting it keeps you in a state of high alert that is stressful and draining, especially when the content may require immediate action. Think of cutting alerts like a digital detox, but less smug, more sustainable and still with access to Google Maps.Stress is the common factor in many behaviours widely understood to be bad for our health – drinking too much booze, smoking cigarettes, even eating unhealthy food. (There is some evidence to suggest that cortisol – the hormone released when we feel stress – makes us crave high fat and sugary foods.) And, these days, many of life’s stressors are communicated via the mobile phone. I cannot stop these stressors, but by turning off notifications, I can at least stop them ambushing me. It’s an action that helps me regain some sense of control. For example, when I open up a news app, I am ready to find out what is happening in the world. It is different from being in the supermarket cheese aisle and getting an alert, where – as part of a whole barrage of communications – I may feel blindsided.One of the great issues of modern life is our overinflated sense of importance. We think: “What if someone needs me urgently?” However, being “needed” is quite rare – wanted, maybe – but needed as an ordinary person who is not a head of state, health worker or something similar? I’m not so sure. Has anyone even noticed I am slower to respond? Have I had a single comment about being slower to reply, from anyone? The answer is a resounding no.I should mention that this neat little tweak is not a magic bullet. The fact I also do yoga and occasionally see a therapist plays a big part in my increased mental calm. But I felt the difference of doing this instantly, and it felt significant.Turning off notifications is the life-changing tweak that I will never go back from. It’s not a trick anyone can make money from, and so perhaps most people will never hear of it – although hearing less from the world might be exactly what is needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/375c173a487b69cec05cc4911369a0d5b570a88e/0_541_2413_1447/master/2413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12da56c0d49781c4c7d58c1fefa62acc","title":"kraftwerk listeners digest german electronic music back catalogue","story":"In Listener’s Digest, a new series to help you through self-isolation, our writers will help you explore the work of great pop musicians. We start with the German electronic pioneers KraftwerkWhile many of us worldwide are unable to experience live music during the coronavirus crisis, or even socialise as normal, we can still use streaming services. Now is the time to delve into that artist you’ve always wanted to check out more deeply – but where to start?This week we’re starting a new series to run during the outbreak (and potentially beyond it) called Listener’s Digest, in which our writers guide you through the back catalogues of various musicians. These aren’t designed to be exhaustive or definitive, but helpful signposts to get you started in some of the world’s most exhilarating bodies of popular music. We kick off with Kraftwerk, and coming up in week one we will have Rihanna, the Fall, Alice Coltrane and Sleater-Kinney. We’ll include a 10-song primer playlist with each, in Spotify and Apple Music.Kraftwerk, who formed in 1970 in Düsseldorf and were a major force in making synths and drum machines the lingua franca of pop, dance and hip-hop, are often named alongside the Beatles as the world’s most important and influential groups. In a UK still guilty of stereotyping Germans as efficient and cool – and the group themselves slyly playing up to that – they are also often dismissed as a heritage act of eccentric boffins. But these reputations belie what is actually a playful, romantic, rapturously melodic body of work, exemplified perfectly by Computer World.With only seven tracks – six really, with the title track in two parts – it is one of the greatest albums of pop melody ever. These tunes are so satisfyingly sturdy and logical – reminiscent of the ringtones and corporate sonic motifs that they helped to usher in – but also spectrally beautiful.As a kind of concept album imagining, and indeed enacting, a digitally mediated future, there are moments of disquiet. Computer Love pre-empts the eerie contradictions of online dating the title track coldly lists “Interpol and Deutsche Bank, FBI and Scotland Yard”, the lack of explanation hinting at the rampant subterfuge of the information age.But it mostly acts as techno-evangelism. One track title announces It’s More Fun to Compute, like a bumper sticker vocalist Ralf Hutter notes with childlike glee on Pocket Calculator, “by pressing down a special key it plays a little melody”. On Home Computer, he sounds like a dad unboxing his first PC: “I program my home computer  beam myself into the future”, he murmurs wondrously. The music, of course, is already there.Listening to this album post-Brexit is deeply poignant. The opening track, Europe Endless, like their first hit Autobahn, evokes a freedom of movement that was then so deeply cherished after the second world war. The title track (plus its clattering counterparts Metal on Metal and Abzug) celebrates the unstoppable force of cross-continental rail travel, though its sterner mien hints at noirish escapades. Elsewhere there is psychological horror, done in pure pop (Showroom Dummies) and drifting ambient (The Hall of Mirrors). Again, the melodies have a purity that harks back to the classical era of Franz Schubert, namechecked here.If they were previously Showroom Dummies coming to life, now they were The Robots, “dancing mechanik”: an announcement of their growing sophistication. Just as on Computer World and Radio-Activity (1975) – which found communication and nuclear technologies both fascinating and troubling – the tension is in their simultaneous enthusiasm and wariness of technology. The Robots’ promise – “We are programmed just to do  anything you want us to” – feels like a malevolently taunting lie, but Spacelab and Neon Lights are beautifully benign. The Model, meanwhile, suggests that there is only melancholy to be found in flesh and blood.One of Kraftwerk’s greatest triumphs is to move with the times, keeping their Kling Klang studio updated rather than becoming a nostalgic analogue synth museum. They returned 17 years after their previous album for this ode to their beloved Tour de France, rendered in sparkling digital sound. Any paranoia has disappeared entirely: the whole album whirrs with happy industry, and a wonder in the blend of science, topography and physical effort that makes up the Tour.Dentaku (taken from Minimum-Maximum, 2005)Kraftwerk have spent the post-Tour years touring themselves, with a superb 3D setup for the greatest hits. This recording from first live album Minimum-Maximum sees them play Dentaku – a higher-tempo, Japanese-language version of Pocket Calculator – to an adoring Tokyo crowd. Their chanting along with Hutter, whose composure cracks into audible glee, is one of the most powerfully human moments in the whole catalogue.Man, Alive to Machine Possibilities, by Jon ParelesThere are not many Kraftwerk interviews and they can tend towards the brittle, but this New York Times piece with Hutter from 2012 is a good, swift grounding in the group’s ethos – “In classical music there is drama. That’s not our thing” – and their notion of itself as a “living organism … We’re the antenna catching information, the transmitter giving information, back and forth.”It’s No More Fun To Compute! by Wolfgang FlurPublished in English by the Quietus is this wonderfully catty German review of a 2013 Kraftwerk live show by former Kraftwerk drummer Wolfgang Flur (whose memoir resulted in a lawsuit from Hutter). He praises the sound quality and 3D visuals but says “the lust seemed gone”, makes Mean Girls-worthy comments about the band’s appearance, and has a go at a woman next to him who “kicked me hard on my left foot, so I shouted at her to be calm and mannered. After all, we were in a museum, not in a rock concert. She apologised, but soon went on with bawling. The smell in that area was such a ghastly mixture – disgusting! I know why I normally avoid such events.”• What are your Kraftwerk favourites? Share them in the comments below.

Ninety per cent of respondents said their income had already been affected.The MU’s general secretary, Horace Trubridge, announced a new hardship fund that will pay grants of £200 to out-of-work musicians, saying: “We hope this fund goes some way to providing a small amount of relief to our members, but we urgently need the government to provide clarity on what wider support will be available, and we call on the record industry to play its part, too.”Musicians being affected by the closure of live venues and schools, as well as other social distancing measures, with many making at least part of their income through teaching.On Friday, the Federation of Entertainment Unions, which comprises the Musicians’ Union, the Bectu section of Prospect, Equity, the National Union of Journalists and the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain, called for the government “to introduce an income guarantee for freelance and self-employed workers for the duration of the Covid-19 outbreak”.A separate petition to the UK government, asking for economic assistance for those working in the events industry, has been signed by nearly 150,000 people.A huge number of tours and music festivals have already been cancelled because of coronavirus, including Glastonbury and Coachella. Many musicians have started performing via online livestreams, including – as part of the World Health Organisation and Global Citizen initiative Together at Home – Chris Martin, John Legend and Camila Cabello.Other stars have pledged financial support for relief initiatives – Rihanna’s Clara Lionel Foundation donated $5m (£4.2m) to various organisations, while Ciara and her husband, Russell Wilson, donated a million meals to a food bank in their home city of Seattle.The US Recording Academy – which organises the Grammys – announced a relief fund for musicians affected by coronavirus via its charity arm, MusiCares."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf1dc5dce4b7246359c56fccb1da729f454fbc16/0_120_3547_2128/master/3547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f29fb1f97c5821259c0966a183ab15a","title":"coronavirus learning to cope with a new normal","story":"Columnist Zoe Williams has spent the week researching tips for life under a new regime of social distancing and self-isolation.

It means all these measures are going to have to be in place for longer. If you follow the rules you are helping the country to get through this as quickly as possible,” he told BBC Breakfast.Asked on the Today programme why people are defying government instructions, he said: “I don’t know because it is very selfish. The consequence of that costs lives and it means for everyone this will go on for longer …“It is incredibly important that people stay more than two metres away from others wherever they are or stay at home wherever possible.“It’s important people get exercise but they should do it staying away from others.”Johnson warned on Sunday that the UK could face an Italy-style lockdown within days if the public do not keep two metres apart but he also stressed that he wanted people to enjoy the outdoors, prompting claims he was sending out mixed messages.Johnson has refused to directly criticise those ignoring government advice but Hancock specifically hit out at those who were carrying on socialising as usual for “putting people in the NHS at risk” and said the government was “absolutely prepared” to bring in tougher measures.He told Sky News: “It’s what we might have to do to protect life ... We’re taking these actions earlier in the epidemic than others European countries, but we’ve seen what’s happened in other European countries.”In a round of broadcast interviews, he acknowledged problems with NHS medical staff getting the right protective clothing to keep them safe from coronavirus and signalled that new lockdown measures could come in “very soon”.Hancock promised the army would help deliver personal protective equipment (PPE), after pleas from medics for the necessary masks, goggles and protective clothing.With reports of nurses wearing bin bags and doctors being given out-of-date masks, Hancock said he took responsibility for improving the situation.“I am determined to ensure that the right kit gets to the right hospital, the right ambulance service, the right doctors’ surgery, right across the country,” said Hancock.“There have been challenges and I can see that. We’re on it and trying to solve all the problems.“I take very seriously my responsibility, as secretary of state, to make sure that everybody working in the NHS, across social care, is safe, and for that they need the right equipment.”Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour deputy leadership contender and medic, reported that doctors were running out of PPE when she worked an A\u0026ampE shift over the weekend.“Are we scared? Of course we are ... but we need to have the PPE to keep us safe and practise social distancing. In a matter of days or a couple of weeks we will be having to make life or death decisions,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.The government insisted that 200 hospitals, ambulance trusts, GP practices, pharmacists, care homes and hospices had all been receiving additional supplies over the past week, with the kit drops set to continue to match demand.From this week the army will start to help to manage and offload supplies in NHS settings, and distribute urgent PPE supplies to the frontline during the coronavirus epidemic.Hancock also revealed that the NHS now has 12,000 ventilators, up from 5,000, but the difficulty will be ensuring enough trained staff to use them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76f781b68064c31303c6c2d506f3f3d02d5f8c34/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff4b9ae9a454a029332683fe1e13d07d","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youCoronavirus infections around the world outside China have grown to more than 87,000, with more than 3,241 deaths.

When it comes to maths puzzles, Winkler is the connoisseur’s connoisseur.Team A and Team B are perennial football rivals. Every year they meet for a series of games. The first team to win four games gets to take home the Golden Teapot and keep it for a year.The teams are evenly matched except for a small home advantage. When playing at home, each team has a 51 per cent chance of winning. (And a 49 per cent chance of losing. No ties are allowed.)Every year, the first three games are played at the home of Team A, and the rest at the home of Team B.Which team is more likely to win the Golden Teapot?A math(s) professor at Dartmouth College in the US, Winkler currently occupies the chair for the public dissemination of mathematics at New York’s Museum of Math.He’s one of my all time puzzle heroes. All of his puzzles contain something special, and today’s is no exception.“I like this puzzle because there are two different approaches to solving it, which appear to lead to opposite conclusions,” he says.He adds: “Puzzles can entertain us, challenge us, and sometimes embarrass us. But the best puzzles do more: they open our eyes to an idea we hadn’t seen before. And they do this in a wonderful way, by making us come up with the idea ourselves.”I hope you solve the problem, and discover the apparent paradox for yourselves.

But scattering them wasn’t as simple as I had thoughtThe candlesticks and photo frames that usually adorn our mantelpiece have been usurped by four less conventional ornaments, and it doesn’t take long for visitors to notice. “Are they... ashes?” Well, yes – but they’re not so much a macabre display of what Americans call “cremains” as a small warehousing operation we’re working on the logistics to enable their respective onward journeys, but for now they are stuck here, above our fireplace. Visitors have other questions: why the Russian hats? Why is that one just a cardboard box? Let me explain.In December 2016, my 70-year-old Uncle Rod, my mum’s younger brother, died. His will, of which I was executor, left his body to medical science. Skeletal and riddled with metastases as he was, the doctors politely declined the gift. His will’s small print stipulated that anything left after his dissection should be cremated and scattered into the Avon from the Ashton Avenue Bridge, near his beloved Bristol City football ground.In life, Rod embraced the unorthodox, and he had mentioned to me years before that he didn’t want a funeral, just a “gathering” of loved ones. I decided the best way of honouring his wishes was to organise a direct cremation – one with no ceremony or witnesses – and a knees-up in the garden room at Bristol Zoo, one of his favourite haunts.About five weeks after his death, I answered the door to a man cradling a sturdy cardboard box in a canvas tote bag: Rod’s mortal remains. We chatted for a few minutes (mainly about how David Bowie had recently been directly cremated and therefore it had to be the coolest option), before he handed the box to me and left. I hadn’t held ashes before they were much heavier than expected. After a few stupefied seconds, I stood and cried for a solid minute, then placed the box on the sitting-room mantelpiece, under a Soviet-badged hat, next to my nan.Ah yes, Nan (and the hats). Rod’s flat had been decorated with remnants of his nomadic past Bobby Kennedy merchandise from the US, aboriginal flags and a didgeridoo from Australia, military memorabilia from eastern Europe. While clearing it out – a hurried process, because the council wanted it back – Dan, my husband, lifted a Cossack hat from a shelf and discovered a large green plastic bottle beneath it. Reading the label that dangled from its neck, he announced: “I’ve found your nan!”Dolly died, aged 90, in 2012 and left no instructions, so my mum popped her on the kitchen windowsill of the family home in Sheffield for a year or two, because “she always did love to see a line of washing”. Rod volunteered to return their mother’s urn to her birthplace, Newport in south Wales, and have her remains interred in her own mother’s grave. We’re not sure why Rod never made it, but we couldn’t leave Dolly in Bristol for the council to find, so she came back to Nottingham with us. It seemed only right to keep her hat on and when we found a second hat in the flat, obviously it had Rod’s name on it.When our thoughts turned to scattering, we decided it might be nice to send Rod and Dolly down river together, although my mum had her reservations (“But she can’t swim!”). Then Rod’s good friend Carol called us from Bristol to say that the Ashton Avenue Bridge was closed while extensive works took place, which is why, over two years later, Dolly and Rod are still sitting to the left of the mirror, under their furry hats.To the right of the mirror are the urns with the ashes of Dan’s Aunty Mary and her husband, John. This summer, when his 89-year-old aunt died, it was my husband’s turn to be an executor.Mary and John courted for 14 years before finally marrying in 2000, when she was 69 and John 65. But, after John’s death in 2014, Mary’s health began to deteriorate, especially her eyesight. She withdrew to her sofa, eating and even sleeping there. While clearing her house, Dan was a little more prepared for the shock of finding the green urn containing John, tucked beside the pillow at the end of the sofa that Mary slept on each night. So John came back with us until after Mary’s funeral, at which point they were reunited on our mantelpiece. This time there were no hats we didn’t want it getting gimmicky.Mary did express her wishes before she died: her ashes are to be scattered, along with John’s, on Woolley Edge, a Wakefield beauty spot. But John’s son from his first marriage is keen to be there, and ill health has so far prevented him from leaving his home in Spain. We’re waiting to coordinate timings for both scattering trips in the meantime the strange quartet will remain on the mantelpiece. They are family, after all, and hiding them away in a cupboard would seem inhospitable.According to Catherine Powell, customer experience director of Pure Cremation, there are almost 250,000 unclaimed urns in the UK. She says that even families who do have the ashes of a loved one can find it hard to agree what to do with them.Will I miss our four urns when they’re gone? The thing is, their very presence represents an absence, because they – Dolly, Rod, Mary and John – are already gone. They’re already missed. And I’m looking forward to getting those candlesticks back where they belong.There is very little legislation around ash scattering, but common sense applies in all settings: consider the effect on the surrounding area and those who use it, and avoid disposing of non-biodegradable tributes along with the ashes. You will also need to make sensible choices about wind direction.On private land You need permission from the landowner.On your own land No permission is required, and there’s no need to keep a record.At a cemetery, churchyard or natural burial site Easily arranged, by applying to the site manager – or ask your funeral director, if you have one, to act on your behalf. At a historic site or beauty spot National Trust England and Wales, English Heritage, Welsh Heritage, Historic Scotland and the National Parks will all consider requests made direct to the local property or landowner. No permanent site markers are allowed. Rather than scatter from or on popular mountain tops, placing ashes inside an out-of-the-way hollow or around a tree is preferred. (The Royal Parks in London and the Forestry Commission do not permit scattering.)At a sports ground Some football and cricket grounds and racecourses will allow ashes to be scattered pitch- or track-side, or sometimes in an adjacent garden of remembrance. Permission must be secured.On rivers or lakes The Environment Agency has published a leaflet about river scatterings, stating that ashes should not be put in water 1km from any drinking water supply, or from bridges over rivers used by boaters or canoeists, or anywhere close to a marina, anglers or bathers. If you can comply with these requirements no permission is necessary. If in doubt, contact your local Environment Agency office, which can also advise about tide times.At sea Many companies offer scatterings by boat all round the UK coastline, but you could also organise your own beach ceremony – again, provided you have consideration for others, and ensure it’s a sandy beach and the ashes are placed below the tide line.Further information is available at environment-agency.gov.uk.•\u0026nbspIf you would like your\u0026nbspcomment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54072c4e355c8b6289ef641e48ecb794f3c4667f/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aff3ee083dfc1cdd7675e525e9121ba2","title":"azerbaijan gp f1 race posptoned coronavirus canada","story":"The Azerbaijan Grand Prix has become the latest race to be pulled from Formula One’s coronavirus-hit schedule.Formula One’s authorities had earmarked the 7 June as a potential start date for the new season after the opening seven grands prix were called off.But the event - which takes place on the streets of Azerbaijan’s capital Baku - has now been postponed because of the covid-19 pandemic.“Baku City Circuit (BCC) has today taken the decision to postpone the Formula One Azerbaijan Grand Prix 2020 due to take place on 7 June,” read a statement from race organisers.“BCC’s primary concern throughout has been the health and wellbeing of the Azerbaijani people as well as all visiting F1 fans, staff and championship participants.”Baku City Circuit intends to monitor the coronavirus situation with a view to announcing a new race date later in the 2020 season.The earliest the F1 campaign can now start is at Montreal’s Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on 14 June although this could also be under threat.“The thoughts of everyone at Baku City Circuit during this challenging and unprecedented situation go out to all those directly and indirectly affected by the coronavirus pandemic,” continued the statement.“We wish to thank all our supporters, customers and partners for your understanding and look forward to welcoming you back to Baku later in the year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec2499092eb8646385caa000d6dde937b4258676/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c04f6eab57260a7e1c615efc626d3b5e","title":"coronavirus sport premier league tokyo olympics","story":"We must accept that it will be many months before packed crowds will be returning to watch live competitionWe still don’t get it. Even now, as death tolls rise exponentially across Europe and the greatest economic crisis of our age deepens, the white lies persist. That the football season could be completed by mid‑July. That the Olympics could take place a week or two after. That a bumper summer of sport will give the nation the mother of all pick‑me‑ups. It is an epic delusion. And, frankly, we have had enough of them already.Over the weekend I spoke to a leading expert, who is involved with the national response to the coronavirus pandemic, to ask him when sport as we know it – in front of packed crowds – might return. His response was sober and downbeat. “My expectation is that this is something that is going to be around for a long period of time,” he said. “There are no silver bullets on the horizon. We are talking months and months – and perhaps even next year and beyond.” Only charlatans, hucksters and superforecasters confidently claim to predict the future. But if we listen closely to the scientists and medical professionals we can anticipate what is coming next. Things will get worse.Many more people will lose their lives. The NHS will be put under enormous strain. And even after the peak – whenever that is – it will take time for social distancing measures to be relaxed and for the coronavirus to be behind us.The scientific expert I spoke to, on condition of anonymity, suggested that a best-case scenario was that an antibody test will be soon developed that will let us know if substantial numbers of the population have been infected and recovered. But, he stressed, it would probably still take six months for it to be developed, ramped up, and tested on the population.Meanwhile a vaccine might not be ready for 18 months, given it will have to go through the necessary safety trials.“We still have very little understanding of how prevalent Covid-19 is in the population,” he said. “And it may be that when we do have those tests, we’ll find out that, actually, there are huge numbers of people who have been exposed and have been asymptomatic and they are immune. That could be a game changer. But we just don’t know at this point. And it would be very reckless to assume that everything is going to go right after that.”Even if football returns behind closed doors – the best‑case scenario – there are obvious issues. If a single player tests positive for the virus then their whole squad will have to self-isolate for a fortnight, elongating the season further. And having ambulances at matches will be seen as hugely irresponsible if the NHS is still under severe strain. As the scientist put it: “We are in a very bad place. And we haven’t even spoken about the impact on the economy. Potentially you’ve got people not being able to afford to go to football matches.”Indeed as the crisis grows I wonder if our top clubs will start feeling a responsibility to help those lower down the food chain. If the Premier League clubs can fork out £250,000 each for Richard Scudamore’s £5m golden goodbye then surely they can find a pot of money to help lower league clubs.More top players should also thinking about giving back. Every fan feels that they have a symbiotic relationship with their club and without supporters paying for Sky Sports subscriptions and season tickets players’ salaries would be nowhere near as astronomical.Maybe before posting videos on social media from their lavishly decorated houses more players could put their hands in their pockets? It’s not as if they can’t afford it. According to the recent Global Salary Survey, the average basic pay for a Premier League first-team squad member is £61,024 a week – and that is before appearance fees, bonuses and any benefits. That’s a cumulative £30m a week in basic wages for the Premier League teams’ 25-man squads. Imagine the difference if every player offered to give up one week’s pay to charity? True, over the weekend Manchester United and Manchester City players donated a combined £100,000 to help food banks. That news was welcome, but it was still a drop in the ocean.At least on Sunday the International Olympic Committee acknowledged for the first time that the Tokyo Games could be delayed. The IOC has set itself a four-week deadline to decide. But given the widespread restrictions on public gatherings and closed training facilities are making it impossible for many athletes to prepare, Tokyo 2020 will surely morph into Tokyo 2021. Even if the virus has subsided in Japan come the summer, it will almost certainly linger in other countries. Would it really be wise to allow 10,000 athletes and close to a million spectators to fly in from across the globe?The expert repeatedly emphasised how uncertain the future looks. There could be a second or third wave of the virus. It could mutate into something worse. However, when I asked him whether there was any chance that this season’s Premier League and Champions League might be finished soon, or the Olympics could take place as planned, he was absolutely clear. “I think it’s delusional to think it’s going to happen. If people are saying that they’ve got absolutely no idea about what’s about to hit them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0925f48c7bb2143cd92bb40b5c4070d745565af/0_165_3707_2223/master/3707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a7e37209fa52098fca413aa7f152728","title":"my favourite game usain bolt wins olympic 200m gold beijing 2008","story":"No one had got near Michael Johnson’s 1996 world record until the Jamaican giant scorched the Bird’s Nest and seared historyNo one was ever going to beat Michael Johnson’s record. Not in my young lifetime anyway, maybe some distant day when I was old and grey, and the game had changed out of all recognition.Remember watching him set it at the Atlanta Olympics in ’96? That idiosyncratic style of his, back straight, carriage low, arms tucked, legs spinning so quick his gold spikes were like sparks from a Catherine wheel. He had a technique all of his own, and maybe that explained why he was so fast. He finished in 19.32sec, three-tenths ahead of his own world record. The man in second place, Frankie Fredericks, ran faster than any one else ever had, and he finished five metres back.Over the next decade, no one got near it. Tyson Gay ran it in 19.62sec, Xavier Carter in 19.63sec, Wallace Spearmon in 19.65sec. They were the second, third, and fourth quickest 200m sprints in history, and Johnson’s time was so far beyond them that it was in another realm altogether. Three of the fastest sprinters in history, and they were pootling around in Olympus’s foothills. There was another wannabe contender, a 20-year-old lean streak from Jamaica called Usain Bolt – a lazy trainer, they said, but lightning quick in the juniors.Bolt broke the 100m world record in May, two months before the Beijing Games. Then that Sunday night in Beijing, he did it again, in the Olympic final. You remember it, everyone does, how he started like a runaway armoire but gathered up so much track in the middle metres that he stopped sprinting and spread his arms down wide either side, then turned to the crowd and slapped his hand against his chest as he came up to the finishing line. There are lots of athletes who are so good they make winning look easy, very few so good they really find it so. He was one of them.What’s less well remembered now is just how upset some people got about it all, how the International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge called him out for “disrespecting his competitors” and said it wasn’t “the way we perceive being a champion”. Watching in the Bird’s Nest stadium, it wasn’t the swagger that bothered me, but the split seconds it had cost him. We didn’t know, then, whether Bolt would run that fast again – Johnson never did – which meant he, and we, might never find out what he was capable of, where his limits, our human limits, really lay.Till four days later, when we found out.Bolt explained later that he hadn’t been bothered about breaking the 100m world record, since it was already his. The 200m mark, Johnson’s impossible 19.32sec, was the one he wanted. Some day, maybe, Johnson said, but not now, not yet. Bolt didn’t have the speed endurance, he said, or the technique to handle running the curve, not at the levels he’d need to beat that time. And who knew better? So far all he’d done was trot through the heats, and here he was clowning around on the start line, without a care in the world.Then the gun went. His start was smooth and fluid, by midway around the curve Bolt had made up the stagger on the four men outside him, by the end of the curve he was metres ahead of them, and now it was just him racing history, chasing Johnson’s ghost. Bolt was out there on the very limits of possibility, pushing, pushing, pushing. This time he didn’t slow, there was no early celebration, he even threw his head and chest ahead in a dip finish. The clock stopped on 19.30sec. He’d done it by two hundredths. And I remember thinking, up in the stands: “So this is what it looks like when God tries for the line.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee934d50c4e83817f85c117d53f037eb6148653c/0_412_6172_3703/master/6172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d3881614287a75cb377930c64a5c7da","title":"tokyo 2020 olympics in doubt as canada becomes first team to pull out over coronavirus","story":"Canada takes action to protect public health as Australia tells its athletes to prepare for Games in 2021Canada has become the first country to warn that it won’t send its athletes to the Tokyo Olympics unless they are postponed for a year, as pressure builds to delay the Games due to the coronavirus pandemic.The Canadian Olympic Committee said holding the Games as planned would threaten the health of its athletes, “their families and the broader Canadian community for athletes to continue training for these Games”.“In fact, it runs counter to the public health advice which we urge all Canadians to follow,” it said in a statement, hours after the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, conceded for the first time that postponement was now a possibility if the Games could not be held in their “complete form”.The committee added: “While we recognise the inherent complexities around a postponement, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our athletes and the world community.”The Australian Olympic committee (AOC), meanwhile, has told its athletes to prepare to compete in the Olympics in the northern-hemisphere summer of 2021.The AOC said the massive disruption caused by the outbreak would make it impossible to assemble a team in time for the Games, which are scheduled to open on 24 July.“We have athletes based overseas, training at central locations around Australia as teams and managing their own programs. With travel and other restrictions this becomes an untenable situation,” its chief executive, Matt Carroll, said in a statement on Monday.New Zealand added to pressure for a delay, saying the country would consider boycotting the Olympics if they open as scheduled.The committee’s president, Mike Stanley, published an open letter on Monday in which he wrote, “Athletes need a safe, and fair, playing field to compete and, right now, the widespread and evolving impact of Covid-19 is not allowing that to happen.” He urged the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to “finalise their decision as soon as possible, bringing clarity to our sports and athletes”.A few hours later, following the news that Japan was considering postponing the Games, Stanley told Newshub that “postponement is the only way to go”, and that New Zealand would consider a boycott if the Games went ahead as planned.Opposition to holding the event in July has risen sharply in recent days, with US Track and Field and UK Athletics among those calling for a delay because of the pandemic. Several countries, including Brazil, Norway and Slovenia, have pressed the IOC to consider postponement but have not threatened a boycott.The IOC said on Sunday that it was drawing up alternative scenarios for the Games, but was not considering calling them off. It said it would take up to a month to reach a decision, although that timeline will soon begin to look unrealistic if more national Olympic committees threaten boycotts.“These scenarios relate to modifying existing operational plans for the Games to go ahead on 24 July 2020, and also for changes to the start date of the Games,” the IOC said in a statement.“The IOC will ... start detailed discussions to complete its assessment of the rapid development of the worldwide health situation and its impact on the Olympic Games, including the scenario of postponement. The IOC is confident that it will have finalised these discussions within the next four weeks.”Abe, who until recently insisted the Olympics’ timing would not change, hinted that postponement could be an option if the coronavirus pandemic made it impossible to hold them in July with the full quota of athletes and spectators.If holding the Olympics in its complete form “becomes impossible, we may have no option but to consider postponing the Games, given the Olympics’ principle of putting the health of athletes first”, Abe told parliament on Monday.Despite the uncertainty, Japan’s Olympics minister, Seiko Hashimoto, said on Monday that the torch relay would start on Thursday as planned. Organisers have asked people not to line the route when the flame begins its journey through Japan’s 47 prefectures in Fukushima."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48add126bef5f3113fd2726d2ceb68346b21296a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17d118d7bf65bb2f8c8a02cf6e564556","title":"on second thoughts italia 90","story":"As a footballing show it left a bit to be desired – but as a dramatic spectacle the World Cup of Schillaci, Milla, Gazza, Pavarotti and the rest was nothing short of immenseA frequent refrain of the tedious muso is that “it’s all about the music”. In reality, it’s often anything but. Most iconic gigs are such because they capture a moment and a mood, whether personal or societal: that first yes-it-really-really-really-could-happen bit of eye contact with the future Mr or Mrs You, or, as Mani said of Spike Island, the chance to “get as many like minds in a field, get ‘em off their tits, give ‘em a bit of music and see what happens”.Take perhaps the last defining concert in this country, Blur at Hyde Park in 2009. Technical niceties weren’t really a consideration most people would have been more interested in the colour of Damon Albarn’s Fred Perry than the range of his falsetto. And do you really think Ian Brown’s voice hit the heights at Spike Island? At Hyde Park, Albarn could have Mockneyed his way through Daisy Bell on loop for two hours in his 1995 Kappa mac and it would not have changed the fact that this was a Culturally Important Moment. When Blur reunited at Glastonbury earlier that summer, even this paper said that it was “not just about the music”.Sometimes, similarly, it’s not just about the football. The comparison with gigs is far from exact, because with football you are talking about improv rather than established material, but it remains true that all live creative pursuits have the capacity to transcend the actual performance. In football, that is never truer than during a World Cup. There is no greater shared experience in sport and maybe even life: 31 days and 31 nights of cool beers and watercoolers big screens and bigger ideas sweepstakes, wallcharts and wall-to-wall football.In that context, it is possible to view the most notorious World Cup of all, Italia 90, a little differently. As a pure football tournament it left a fair bit to be desired – although, as we shall see, it might not be as bad as the received wisdom suggests – but as a dramatic spectacle it was immense: a freestyle opera so full of rich and lasting experiences as to make the cliché of “balmy, barmy nights” almost irresistible. Not a great tournament, but certainly an epic one. Of all the World Cups in the last 40 years, only Italia 90 could have produced a book as soulful and momentous as Pete Davies’s All Played Out. More than any other, Italia 90 felt like a World Cup.It captured a mood and, being the last World Cup before the Premier League and the Champions League, came at a time when anything was possible for football. We know now that the showers-that-be ballsed that up completely, but we didn’t then. If Matthew Engel, one of the most original and brilliant sportswriters this country has produced, calls Italia 90 an “unmitigated triumph” for its wider impact – as he did in this paper the day before the final – that will do for us. So will the comment of MaidMarian in an article about great tournaments: “Italia 90 was a great event just spoiled by the football.”Much of that was to do with the venue. Italy. All football tournaments should be held in Italy, where calcio is consumed with a passion that makes religion seem almost frivolous by comparison. At the time Serie A was the best league in the world by a distance, and the game has rarely felt as important as it did around then. Italy ached with such fervour that the tournament could not fail to haemorrhage grandeur and gravitas. Two days after the final, Ian Ridley wrote in this paper that “probably only in Italy could such an unsatisfying tournament overall – in footballing terms, that is – have been such a success”.On the field, Italia 90 had two major things going for it: an almost ceaseless supply of drama, and a number of inidual and collective stories that went straight into World Cup folklore. We usually associate drama in football with the cheap theatre of goalfests, but Italia 90 infamously has the lowest goals-per-game average (2.21). There were another 28 goals scored that did not go in the book: it’s fitting that such a dramatic tournament should have set a new record of four penalty shoot-outs – including, uniquely, two in the semi-finals – that has not been bettered (though there were also four in 2006). Some felt those semi-finals were cheapened by the manner in which they were decided, but both were immense matches regardless – probably the best pair of semi-finals in any World Cup, which counterbalances the appalling final. It’s certainly the case that they were the first pair of semi-finals since 1966, and perhaps 1954, in which we did not, deep down, know the result of at least one of the matches in advance.The mighty nature of the semi-finals was a reflection of a tournament whose balance of shocks and heavyweight clashes was perfect. This is an absolutely vital element of a World Cup yet one that is rarely commented upon. If you have too many thrilling shocks early on you end up with predictable semi-finals (1994, 2002), and if you have none you end up without that Pak Doo-ik moment (2006). Somewhere in between is Italia 90, which had an immaculate model: one largely unknown side to gallivant as far as the quarter-finals but no further (Cameroon), with another also providing a significant shock or two (Costa Rica) one or two dark horses to reach the quarter-finals (Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia), and everyone out the way so that four proper teams can face off in the semi-finals.Italia 90 was able to achieve this despite the elimination of Brazil and Holland in the second round, another development that lends considerable weight to suggestions that this was one of the most dramatic World Cups. As a loose rule of thumb, the quarter-finals is par for the top tier of international sides: if you go out at that stage it might still be failure, and the coach can be quietly confident there will be a P45 waiting for him when he gets home, but it is not humiliation. Yet if you go out before that, you will be remembered forever.That meant the two games on Sunday 24 June were imbued with an impossible tension. Bad enough that one of Brazil and Argentina were going out, and one of Holland and West Germany, but to go out to their most hated rivals was utterly unthinkable. Brazil lost to Argentina in perhaps the greatest smash-and-grab of all – worse still, they were vaccinated by Diego Maradona, who produced one of the great assists to win the match – while Holland were thrashed 2-1 by West Germany and humiliated further when Frank Rijkaard mistook Rudi Völler’s perm for an old tissue.Brazil’s exit is still their earliest since 1966 – a harsh legacy for a brutally underrated team who were disparaged for their sacrilegious sweeper system but who were completely dominant in all four of their matches – while Holland, who played with the vigour of men emerging from an Amsterdam café in the small hours, are rightly judged by the peerless historian Cris Freddi as “the most disappointing team in any finals tournament”. They did, at least, contribute to one of the greatest days in any World Cup.To continue the dramatic theme, we had the most shocking start to any World Cup when Cameroon beat the holders Argentina, and a few seismic late goals: Freddy Rincon to put Colombia through from Group D, Daniel Fonseca to put Uruguay through from Group E – and shatter the hopes of Scotland and Austria in two other groups – and, of course, David Platt’s life-changing volley against Belgium. There was even, for the only time in the World Cup, the drawing of lots to decide which of Holland and Ireland would be beaten by West Germany in the second game.The redemption of West Germany, who had lost the previous two finals, was one of many fantastic tales, both collective and inidual, that will keep us warm as the years close in. Most nations would have gone a big rubbery one at the prospect of deliverance from the pain of Ea 82 and Mexico 86, but Germany just went about their business with the minimum of fuss. This side is occasionally, unfathomably criticised, yet they were as good a power team as there has ever been, with scarcely a weakness and at least six world-class players in Andreas Brehme, Jurgen Kohler, the utterly underrated Guido Buchwald, Lothar Matthäus, Jürgen Klinsmann and Rudi Völler. The quality of the champion is a vital part of a World Cup’s legacy, and in that regard Italia 90 is in credit: the Germans were the best between 1970 and 2010.England’s journey was equally compelling, from “No Football Please, We’re English” (the headline in Gazzetta dello Sport after the appalling first match against Ireland) to a performance of genuine continental sophistication in that semi-final against West Germany, Their progress may have been a little hamfooted – a three-goal win would not have flattered Cameroon in the quarter-final, and Belgium had slightly the better of an excellent second-round game – but they were also ingenuous, likeable and, by using a sweeper system that seemed astonishingly sophisticated in a country that taught 4-4-2 on the curriculum, thrillingly European. They were also very worthy winners of the Fifa Fair Play Award, and the goodwill of that match against West Germany was truly remarkable for a game of such importance.Goodwill flowed towards Ireland as they gave it a lash and sneaked into the quarter-finals in their first-ever World Cup. There was Argentina’s warped and guiltily hilarious defence of their title, which they surrendered as compliantly as Tony Montana did his life say what you like about them, but the World Cup will never have better pantomime villains. There was the eye-watering thuggery and eye-moistening brilliance of Cameroon, the first African side to reach the quarter-finals. And then there were the hosts. Other nations have wanted to win a World Cup just as much as Italy did in 1990, but none have needed to win it quite as much. When they went out to Argentina in the semis, you could almost feel the wailing.Italy’s star was Toto Schillaci, compelling evidence that beauty can be in the eyes of the beholdee. Italy will always talk about the “Notto Magiche di Toto Schillaci”. He won the Golden Ball and the Golden Boot but he was not the only man whose life was defined by four weeks in the summer of 1990: Paul Gascoigne came from leftfield to inspire England (it’s easy to forget that he wasn’t even certain of a place in the squad until an astonishing performance against the Czechs in late April), Roger Milla came out of of retirement to drive Cameroon to the last eight with four goals and proof that some old men can dance and Sergio Goycoechea came from the shadows to save the penalties that took Argentina to the final.Stories and drama are, you might say, all well and good, but the football was negative and unwatchable and blah blah blah . Well. The main evidence used to damn Italia 90 is that average of 2.21 goals per game, yet there is an uncomfortable contradiction here. At the time, Serie A was rightly seen as superior – yet that had an extremely similar ratio (2.24 in 1989-90 2.29 in 1990-91). It is dangerous to confuse negativity with defensive excellence, and there was plenty of the latter on offer. Ireland and Egypt were negative, Cameroon were filthy and Argentina were both, but the rest were fairly blameless. The technical quality was very high, too. And, though Italia 90 is seen as an affront to the purists, surely the 1-1 draw between West Germany and England in the semi-final of that tournament is preferable to the basketball farce between Italy and West Germany at the same stage of the 1970 World Cup, when six goals were scored in the final 31 minutes because everyone had shot their bolt in the heat?If you did a Family Fortunes-style survey and asked 100 people to name the worst World Cup, Italia 90 would surely come top. Yet the reality is simply not that clear cut: purely in terms of entertaining football, there are strong arguments that 1938, 1962, 2002, 2006 and maybe 2010 were inferior. Italia 90’s problem was not that it was the worst, but that it was the first: the first low-scoring World Cup of the colour television era (and the first in which one team failed to score in the final, which seems incredible now), and thus forever to be despised. It is seen as the dark age of football, before the abolition of the backpass and the assault from behind, but in reality it was simply the case that the balance between attack and defence was slightly out of whack. The dark age is now, ever since the Millennium Bug of 4-2-3-1 kicked in.The fact that Italias 90’s appeal extended beyond the action is reflected by the staggeringly high quality of its peripherals. The Proustian rush of the BBC’s titles will, of course, never be bettered in sport, but that is not all. The 21st-century stadia, all built or heavily redeveloped for the tournament, were remarkable and the kits were the best of any World Cup. Italia 90 came after the Toffs era of classy but plain kits, and just before design tools and their design tools got to work (and also just before adidas unfathomably marginalised the trefoil). Nor was there a corporate overload: Brazil’s kit, an elegantly faded colour rather than the brilliant yellow we know now, was made by Topper. Topper. How cool is that? And how cool were the TV graphics, part of RAI’s superb coverage, which included umpteen fresh and new camera angles. We even had Orbis’s World Cup 90, a one-off that was as good as sticker albums got. This stuff may seem piffling, but it all added to the feel of a Proper World Cup.There was plenty more to take from the tournament. As we did a similar thing during an On Second Thoughts on USA 94, here’s a list of other things to remember fondly from Italia 90.Klinsmann producing an inidual performance for the ages against Holland the hideous cruelty, on an inidual level, of the already besieged Jim Leighton’s crucial mistake against Brazil the hideous cruelty, on a collective level, of Taffarel’s miraculous injury-time save from Mo Johnston in the same game the two-footed perfection of West Germany’s left wing-back Brehme, who scored two penalties with his right foot having scored one with his left at Mexico 86, and who was such an attacking threat that the Holland right-winger Johnny Van’t Schip’s principal job was to mark him (Brehme scored the decisive goal with a delicious curler) the mysterious and apparently impenetrable Italian defence, which went a World Cup record 517 minutes before conceding Maradona’s crafty politicking before the semi-final and then his staggeringly cocky penalty at the end of the same game, which left most of Italy foaming with impotent rage Barry Davies giving Carlos Valderrama a rollocking a split-second before Valderrama’s regal reverse pass allowed Rincon to score and put Colombia into the last 16 the peerless Davies holding the name “CANIGGIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA” for an age Gazza making a prat of Mark Goodier Milla making a prat of René Higuita Massing.Gary Lineker’s nervelessness from the spot against Cameroon, particularly as, in the first instance, he was taking England’s first penalty for four years the outside of Enzo Scifo’s right foot John Motson shrieking “You can’t have this in the final” after Gustavo Dezotti’s assault on Jürgen Kohler, as if it would have been a hoot in the semis the regal smoothness of Careca’s two goals against Sweden the majestic simplicity of Ruud Gullit’s goal against Ireland Murdo MacLeod being sparked out by a Branco free-kick to such an extent that he tried to head a cross into his own net a few moments later and prepared to wheel away before it drifted wide of the top corner Belgium’s supreme performance with 10 men against Uruguay Tony Cascarino’s penalty against Romania when, having walked from the halfway line while getting all sorts of agita from the voice inside his head (“You look like a man about to meet a firing squad… The whole world is watching. Frightening, isn’t it? … You’d better assure your mother. ‘Don’t do it son!’ she’s screaming. ‘What happens if you miss?’”), he kicked the ground so hard that he could have broken his foot, but still scored Dragan Stojkovic’s performance against Spain, and particularly his dummy for the first goal Michel’s hat-trick against South Korea two silk-smooth English Deses, Lynam and Walker one of them having a brief but total shocker against Cameroon a phalanx of Czech midfielders whose left feet were not much educated as doctoral hearing the Stone Roses on the BBC Bobby Robson admitting that “4-4-2 saved us” after the Cameroon game, which in the climate of the time was akin to saying you preferred Primark underwear to Ann Summers the otherwise unfairly maligned Howard Wilkinson telling the England team that “they had a bye, basically” against Cameroon, who then gave them a proper chasing and Matthäus’s chilling second goal against Yugoslavia, neck and neck with Roberto Baggio’s meandering run as the best of the tournament.There were, we’re sure you’ll disagree, some pretty memorable on-field moments. But it was about more than that. If football is more than a game, then Italia 90 was more than the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a103827889d93363dc6d5539ea31658641007ef/0_65_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09c24a743a7b722424a20e562b38e8f0","title":"life measured out in cricket bats","story":"Cricketers can spend a whole lifetime searching for ‘the one’. It does exist. You just have to know where to lookBy James Wallace for The NightwatchmanA Sunday morning in May 1993. I’m five years old and sans plans. My parents have dragged me to a car-boot sale in Bakewell, Derbyshire. Wandering among the bric-a-brac, memorabilia and mid-1990s estate cars with a weapons-grade sulk, I am stopped in my tracks. There it is. Propped up in the boot of a clapped-out, teal-coloured Austin Maestro that belongs to one of the town’s many grizzled elder statesmen. I vaguely recognise him – impossibly old and with huge sideburns. He nods knowingly, but not warmly, at my dad, who is holding my increasingly clammy little paw.“It’s a bit big for you lad.”The old man has clocked my eyes darting from his sideburns and rheumy eyes to a small cricket bat propped up against a pile of old suitcases. The words “Gunn \u0026amp Moore Diamond” adorn the top quarter in a pleasing font. The small blade is nut brown, its even-spaced grain running from top to bottom as if a team of highly trained ants has abseiled down its face. It has no grip but this only adds to its allure, with the string-work around the handle precise and taut. My dad hands over £5 and the bat is mine. This is the Damascene moment. Cricket is now my life.Growing up as the youngest of four brothers, there were a lot of hand-me-downs knocking about and plenty of sharing. Cricket bats were no different. It definitely helps to be the runt of the litter in this scenario. Not only are you exposed to the rigours of the game from an early age and playing against people who are, to misquote Daft Punk, harder, bigger, faster, stronger… older, you are forced to give as good as you get. Or better. Kevin Pietersen said the games of rugby and cricket he played on his front lawn against his brothers (he is the third of four) growing up in Pietermaritzburg were more competitive than some of the international cricket he played in his career. I’ve never played elite-level sport but the scars, detached retinas and smashed windows in our garden games serve to tell a similar tale.All of this means that I got my hands on proper bats, big-boy bats, from an early age. I had no fear and felt like each time I had bat in hand it was an opportunity to impress. My eldest brother had a Gray-Nicolls Scoop 2000 Brian Lara signature bat. This was the mid-1990s and Lara had recently compiled his epic 375 and 501 not out. Holding that bat you could almost feel the power surging through the willow, up the handle and into your wrists and forearms. It made you want to play in an attacking way, all high backlift and flamboyant strokeplay. The Ronseal on the garden shed would barely be dry before it was pounded again. Anything loose outside the wicker laundry basket was extravagantly punished. Returning to play with the blue plastic Kwik-Cricket bats and with children my own age, I felt like Lara himself. The plastic felt wrong, all shiny and slippery to the touch. I had already been having regular hits of the hard stuff, smelling the linseed and wafting the willow and so to go back to the blue-moulded methadone was dispiriting and ego-inflating in equal measure.Bats are special and we have a deep relationship with them. Whether you are a club plinkster or slogger, gnarled county pro or international superstar, you will have probably had a favourite in your lifetime. Maybe you have spent your whole life trying to find “the one”? The feel, the pick-up, the grain, the fabled sweet spot, talked about in hushed tones on boundary edges. It does exist. You just have to know where to look.Bats are the stuff of myth and legend, part of the fabric and folklore of the game. Dennis Lillee chucking his aluminium ComBat away in anger Sachin Tendulkar polishing the red cherry marks from the edge of his bat to give the impression everything was hit in the middle and renowned grip-botherer Graham Thorpe endlessly fiddling with his rubbers.My favourite bat, “the one”, arrived in my mid-to-late teens. I had held enough handles and studied enough grains to know what I liked and didn’t like. And I knew something special and worth investing in when it came along. I’d lusted over a Gunn \u0026amp Moore Purist ever since I’d seen Michael Vaughan unfurl his trademark cover drive. That high elbow and precise footwork. Dripping in class. I needed to do whatever was necessary to re-create that shot. The quest for the Purist began.The first time the Arctic Monkeys played, or even went to Glastonbury, they headlined it. Imagine that. Barely out of their teens. Those four lads from Sheffield, with their colloquial lyrics and propulsive, frantic rhythms, soundtracked our adolescence and young adulthood. The first time I batted with the Purist in a league match I made 111 not out. Nelson. That was my Arctic Monkeys at Glastonbury moment. The first one. The big one. I’ve had other knocks since but none stand out like that. I can remember particular shots, the way the bat felt in my hands, the sound the ball made as it whistled off the face and seemed to go nearly always where I intended. I remember thinking that this doesn’t normally happen. I can remember not taking my helmet off initially as it felt a bit showy but then I succumbed and the moment took over. I also remember who I waved my bat at*.My dad had us round for his birthday party a few months ago and my seven-year-old nephew insisted that he wanted to play cricket. I went up to the attic and there was my Purist leant up against the wall behind the door. I picked it up and did a few shadow forward defensives. It felt different. Outdated somehow. A bit of a relic. It was heavier than I remembered and with about three too many grips. I placed my fingers around the mangy handle and gave it a gentle squeeze. A forgotten familiarity slowly seeped through me. I can equate it only to the feeling of hearing the opening chords to a once-loved song that you haven’t heard in years. A melancholy-tinged euphoria.I placed it back reverently. There was no way I was taking that bat out for my nephew to thrash around with. It was far too big for him anyway. I spied an old communal family Slazenger that was still too big for him but would be manageable. Wieldable. It was a better fit. It wasn’t my Purist.But times have changed. It seems not every batsman has such a deep relationship with their blade. Nowadays bats are softer pressed and increasingly more disposable. Maybe bat idolatry is found only in the amateur player, the dreamer, the romantic, and there isn’t time for such woolly guff in the modern professional game. You only have to look at a twelfth man gambolling on with armfuls of bats for a lower-order batsman in a Test match. The batsman inspects them briefly before selecting one with barely more than a glance and a nod. Harry Potter’s Elder Wand or King Arthur’s Excalibur it ain’t.Bats are a tool, used to hit the ball and “make” runs with. But they also serve as a conduit. Like a guitarist who swears by a Telecaster but knows deep down that the music is the only thing that really matters. Bats carry our weekend hopes and childhood dreams. They can be blamed for our failures, lusted after in their absence, and mourned, but they are a willow vein to the beating heart – cricket. Cricket is the constant. Bats have come and gone but my love for cricket won’t ever splinter, bow or break. Here, then, is my life in bats.The first love. The gateway bat. It was used for garden or back-lane cricket, or occasionally French cricket if space and time were limited. The Diamond was a dominator of the tennis ball and was not to be used with anything harder than a windy ball for fear of damage to both itself and the neighbour’s property. They don’t make them like this anymore, certainly not for a fiver.If I close my eyes I can still smell the linseed oil and hear the sound of my brothers’ bickering. Just for the record: YOU CAN BE OUT FIRST BALL. Also, if you hit the ball over the fence into the next-door garden then you should go and retrieve it. Don’t send your little brother every single time.I still don’t know why there is a size of a bat named after a posh school. Cricket, eh? The local club received a load of kit from the Lord’s Taverners and it was absolute mayhem in the pavilion that day. The kindly gent who ran things, Gerald, let me take a V800 home. I’m still not sure of the arrangement we had. I suspect I was supposed to take it back at some point and never did. I was known as “one-shot Wallace” for this entire period, favouring a leg-side hoick to every single ball, and this bat was with me during a phase of fierce competitive cockiness.The nadir was a friendly practice game down the local park in which I tried my customary swipe to leg and top-edged one into the nose of the wicket-keeper. These were pre-helmet days. I insisted on carrying on with the game even though it was clear to everyone else that urgent medical attention was required – a 12-year-old boy with a ginger afro was pawing at the earth trying to locate his broken face. We eventually came to the compromise that the emergency services could be called as long as I could pick up where I left off the following week. If memory serves, I converted the 12 not out into a dashing 30, despite all the distractions. Great bat. Horrid boy.I shared this bat with my brother. He saved up to pay for it he has always been thriftier than me. I lent him my Gray-Nicolls gloves I had ordered from the Morrant Sports catalogue that Christmas and that was the arrangement we had. Later, a pair of Kookaburra batting shorts became part of the deal too. I never felt like a Hunts County man. It was very much my brother’s choice and I just went along with it because I was 14 and penniless. The sight of the stag on the front sticker was a bit like when you go into a pub and see a beer badge with a warlock or goblin on it alongside some olde worlde font and you think it’s all a bit too much really and order a Guinness.I also remember it feeling reedy and thin. A little poncey maybe, like the posh boys who used to get a new Newbery bat each summer and every other piece of kit with the same brand. Looking like they were sponsored. Even though they were 14 and rubbish. I did score my first competitive fifty with this bat, albeit in a match that was played on the school multi-sports pitch with a boundary made up of luminous cones and leftover quoits. At least three boys from our side were playing in their school uniform, complete with lost-property trainers.The first proper bat that was all mine. “The one.” Like a Telecaster or E-type Jaguar, the old Purist was a classic. Note the “original”, meaning the willow was of a higher grade. So was the price. The burgundy handle was like something out of a Farrow \u0026amp Ball catalogue and the classic Gunn \u0026amp Moore design tapped into those feelings I had when I first held the Diamond over a decade previously. I honed my Vaughan-esque cover-driving with this bat. Admittedly the opposition bowling was less Brett Lee at 90mph at the MCG and more middle-aged-dobber with a sizeable gut at a backwater ground in the Yorkshire and Derbyshire League third ision.I felt at one with the Purist and used it well past its prime. All the other players at the club and among the opposition gradually started using new-fangled bats with names such as “Beast” and “Destroyer”. These bats had massive, thick edges like four pieces of white sliced bread stuck together. They were undoubtedly lighter and had a sweet spot twice the size of my trusty and increasingly scuffed blade. I clung on loyally to my Purist and duck-taped it, oiled it, even got a new toe grafted on to it after digging out one too many yorkers, until finally it snapped in two during an innings, the handle bursting through and taking half of the blade with it. I had it mended even though I knew it would never be fit for use in a match again. Grief does funny things. Like the bereaved animal-lover who deals with the loss of a pet by seeking solace in taxidermy and getting their iel stuffed into a pouffe, the Purist is still in my parents’ attic.Some bloke at the local club knew a bloke who knew a bloke who worked for Slazenger as a rep. The bloke at the local club came in one Saturday flustered and excitable, saying his contact had somehow acquired all the bats rejected by Slazenger poster boys such as Jacques Kallis and Ian Bell, and that us muggles could own these “rejects” for a cut-down price. Most of the team dutifully and probably gullibly signed up and handed over wads of cash. A few weeks later the Slazenger hoard landed.Me and my brother shared custody (he paid) of a brand-new Slazenger bat. We convinced ourselves it was one that just missed out on selection by Kallis. Not quite good enough for South Africa’s pre-eminent all-rounder was good enough for us, especially as it cost little more than a post-match round in the pub. Yet to be knocked in, with a huge bow and incredible lightness and feel to it. We didn’t like the garish stickers all over it so peeled them off and removed the clear protective sheath too. Once fitted with a yellow grip, it looked just like the bat that Steve Waugh used in the 2001 Ashes. The anonymous destroyer.That was my last bat. It broke in an indoor net at The Oval last year and I cycled home with it on my handlebars, swathed in a bag for life. I remember thinking of the film E.T. as I pedalled by moonlight up Kennington Lane while balancing my swaddled willow corpse. I had to get it “home”.It remains behind the bedroom door, my girlfriend eyeing it suspiciously, especially when the wind blows a certain way and a waft of linseed fills the room. One day I’ll pluck up the strength to recycle it or put it out with the bins. One day.*Andrew was there when I scored my first century. Of course he was. He was always there. Andrew, my brother. The runs were for you. And so is this.In these turbulent times, The Nightwatchman has opened its archives to support and show solidarity with cricket-lovers across the globe.

However, when the stages eventually reopen, a lot of audiences will, paradoxically, still find themselves watching TV.While movies have long been a source of theatrical material, old TV series have started to rival them as inspiration for adaptations. Among the most anticipated of the stage productions currently furloughed is a recycling (appropriately) of The Good Life, the 70s BBC sitcom about a suburban couple who adopted a green lifestyle decades before it became fashionable.Theatre shows currently suspended include a UK tour of the sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em and a musical version of Only Fools and Horses. Longer term, a musical of The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin is in preparation at Birmingham Rep.Why has theatre become so drawn to classic sitcoms? Jeremy Sams, adapter-director of The Good Life stage remake, says: “There can be a pragmatic reason. The reason they’ve put on Pretty Woman: The Musical, for example, is that the people who went to see the original movie are now rich enough to pay West End theatre prices.”Viewers of 70s sitcoms may similarly have economically matured. But a major creative motivation is that TV sitcoms and stage comedies are close artistic siblings. Most scenes in the original shows were performed in big auditorium studios, in front of hundreds who had applied for tickets. Another recent TV-theatre transfer, The Upstart Crow, though screened much more recently, was specifically made to a 70s live-audience template.“The rules of stage comedy,” says Sams, “are very similar to those of sitcom, in terms of settings and numbers of characters.”Although often assumed to be a canned laughter track, British studio audience laughter was usually real, though sometimes electronically enhanced. So, to maximise audible reaction, episodes were often structured like a stage farce. Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em, in which Michael Crawford played the accident-prone and unemployable Frank Spencer, specialised in spectacular stunts, with the character tumbling down stairs or his house falling down around him.As a result, Guy Unsworth, who adapted and directed the stage version, feels that he is bringing stage-farce conventions back home. “I think the live studio audience was absolutely key because it gives these scripts a theatrical energy. TV is often shot very safely in many takes. But the stunts had a real sense of danger, because they were designed to make the studio audience gasp. So I was fascinated by doing those in theatre.”The estates of the writers of The Good Life, John Esmonde and Bob Larbey, allowed Sams to use any material he wanted from the 30 broadcast episodes.“I sat down to construct it as a play,” he says, “but it seems to be in the DNA of sitcom that it falls into half-hour chunks. So I effectively now have four half-hour acts, with an interval after two, that lead into each other and form a single story.”He has substantially redeployed three episodes from the series – including those in which Tom and Barbara first decide to go green, a baby pig is born and Margot sings in an amateur production of The Sound of Music – and shaped a storyline of his own around two dinner parties.In the case of Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em, the TV writer Raymond Allen, 80 this month, was available to be involved in the stage version, but chose not to be. “He was really keen on the idea,” says Unsworth, “but didn’t know how to make it work on stage. So he has been incredibly supportive but also trusted me to do it.”From the 23 available episodes, Unsworth has framed a play around an episode in which Frank discovers that he is going to be a father, and a Christmas special in which the BBC comes to audition Frank for a TV talent show. At the performance I saw, the show was regularly stopped by laughter or applause at the crossed-purpose dialogue, a signature of the TV show, in which, for up to 15 minutes, some characters think “it” refers to one thing (often sex) while the rest of the cast and the audience are aware of the real definition. As when the local priest fears he is being told elaborate details of the night of the Spencer baby’s conception, rather than an account of domestic renovations.“I found the sequences of misunderstanding really interesting,” says Unsworth. “What a character falsely thinks ‘it’ to be can be really quite daring and out there, because the audience knows that the real explanation is completely innocent, so it somehow makes it OK.”However, because TV peak-time of the past was significantly less sensitive to stereotype and offence than is contemporary culture, I was interested in how much of the source material had proved unspeakable now? Some Mothers, says Unsworth, didn’t really have ’em. “I went through every single episode, and maybe there are a couple of lines that might be a bit iffy now. But, considering that vintage of sitcom, and how really dodgy many of them are, Some Mothers exists in quite an innocent world.”Sams was startled by the casual homophobia of The Good Life on TV: “Someone will cock a wrist to suggest that someone might be gay, in a way I have never seen any gay person do ever. And there is a tight-fisted restaurateur in one episode who can be seen as an offensive Jewish stereotype. That sort of stuff passed without notice in those days. It was part of the weather. So I’ve cut those.”In performance, a crucial question is whether the performers are giving their own interpretation of the character, or an impersonation of the original TV actor. In a recent one-off TV revival of Are You Being Served?, for example, no one seemed to have decided if the new cast was playing John Inman or his character Mr Humphries, Mollie Sugden or Mrs Slocombe.“People have actually asked me, ‘Who’s playing Felicity Kendal?’, or ‘Who’s playing Penelope Keith?,” says Sams. “It can’t be like that.”He has cast Katherine Parkinson as Barbara, with further casting to be announced soon. “In auditions, there were actors who didn’t know the TV show, and so just treated it as the script for a new play. And that was fantastic. Because that’s what I’m aiming for.”Unsworth says that he and his lead actor, Joe Pasquale, “worked on that issue from the very beginning. Michael Crawford was absolutely amazing on screen. But I felt Joe had to be someone very different. I was saying all the time, ‘Play him as a character.’ If you are spending two hours with someone on stage, you have to believe in them as human beings. And an impression, however skilled, wouldn’t be as good as the original.”Raymond Allen has given the live Frank Spencer an active recommendation (“He’s seen it 16 times,” says Unsworth. “He’s thrilled by it”) and the Esmonde and Larbey estates have enthusiastically approved Sams’ adaptation.Preparing his production, Sams is most exercised by staging the menagerie that the Goods assemble to achieve self-sufficiency. Will they be animatronic animals? “I’ve written a part for a goat, which is very important. At the moment, I’m trying to work out how to do it without a real one. Partly because a goat ends up costing more than a performer, once you pay for the goat wrangler and the goat dressing room, and so on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3f5b6722ceafea4bdf6745376ffff028c39922/0_83_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3b674870d12d87f3a796be227068964","title":"fad or fixture are electric cars the future of motoring","story":"Electric vehicles have been celebrated as the greener, cost-efficient future of travel. Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

If anything, the Bloomberg Global Health Index would suggest Italians have a healthier lifestyle than Germans.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.German politicians and senior health officials have been reluctant to comment on the low mortality rate while the situation is developing so rapidly. Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the government’s central public health body, has said he does not expect there to be a significant difference in mortality rates between Italy and Germany in the long run.“It’s too early to say whether Germany is better medically prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic than other countries,” said Marylyn Addo, who heads the infectiology department at Hamburg’s University Medical Centre.One likely explanation for the discrepancy in figures, Addo suggested, was that while northern Italy’s hospitals are being overrun with new patients, Germany’s are not yet at full capacity and have had more time to clear beds, stock up on equipment and redistribute personnel.“One advantage Germany has is that we started doing professional contact tracing when the first cases were reported,” Addo said. “It bought us some time to prepare our clinics for the coming storm.”Crucially, Germany started testing people even with milder symptoms relatively early on, meaning the total number of confirmed cases may give a more accurate picture of the virus’s spread than in other states.According to Germany’s National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, the country has capacity for about 12,000 Covid-19 tests per day, while Wieler has claimed it has capacity for 160,000 tests per week.While Germany has not tested its citizens at the same high rate practised in South Korea, guidelines have been in place for more than a month for people to be tested even if they have early-stage symptoms but have either had contact with an infected person or recently visited a “high-risk area” such as Lombardy in Italy or Wuhan in China.The age profile of those affected in the first few weeks has also been younger than in other countries, many of them fit and healthy people returning from skiing resorts in Austria or Italy, which would also help explain the low mortality rate.“I assume that many young Italians are or were infected without ever being detected,” Christian Drosten, a virologist at Berlin’s Charité hospital, told the newspaper Die Zeit. “This also explains the virus’s supposedly higher mortality rate there.”Drosten, who has been advising the German health ministry, has also warned that Germany’s mortality rate is likely to rise in the coming weeks as high-risk areas become harder to identify and testing capacity becomes stretched.“It will appear that the virus has become more dangerous, but this will be a statistical artefact, a distortion. It will simply reflect what’s already starting to happen: we’re missing more and more infections.”The methodology behind Germany’s data gathering could also play into the discrepancy between Italian and German figures.If a patient is tested positive for Covid-19 in Germany, the doctor will notify the local health authority, which will then digitally transfer the data to the Robert Koch Institute. The lag in this process explains why the RKI’s daily figures have been consistently lower than those from Johns Hopkins University, which updates its data tables more frequently. By 10am on Sunday morning, for example, the RKI only notes 55 fatalities in Germany.Unlike in Italy, there is currently no widespread postmortem testing for the novel coronavirus in Germany. The RKI says those who were not tested for Covid-19 in their lifetime but are suspected to have been infected with the virus “can” be tested after death, but in Germany’s decentralised health system this is not yet a routine practice.As a result, it is theoretically possible that there could be people who may have died in their homes before being tested and who do not show up in the statistics.Practising medical specialists such as Addo do not believe this number of unreported cases to be statistically significant. “I have yet to see any data that would suggest a large number of untested corona-related deaths that don’t show up in the statistics,” she said.“Clinics dealing with respiratory illnesses have been on high alert about the virus for weeks, so I would be very surprised if there was a significant figure of uncharted deaths.” The RKI’s official mortality figures include both people who have died of the virus as well as those infected and with underlying health problems, where the precise cause of death could not be determined."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17fa5535aff3c1e610f1e35759c9940a936e808d/0_11_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c574a1617c8dcbead9e1dc9efc37317","title":"which conditions mean that you should isolate for 12 weeks","story":"Government plans are for 1.5m people to ‘take themselves out of society’ for three monthsThe government announced on Sunday that it would be sending letters to 1.5 million people in England suffering from one of more than a dozen serious conditions which it is believed put them most at risk from coronavirus.Others have been urged to do everything they can to help the group, “whether it’s going shopping for a neighbour in need, or keeping inside if you know you’re at risk,” by health secretary Matt Hancock.The groups defined as “extremely vulnerable” who will receive the letter are:• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical radiotherapy for lung cancer.• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment.• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer.• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or Parp inhibitors.• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6 months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.• People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe COPD.• People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly increase the risk of infections (such as SCID and homozygous sickle cell).• People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of infection.• Women who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired.Those in the group are advised:• Strictly avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus.

Here is what we know now.Yes. They can be infected with and appear to be able to transmit coronavirus, even if they do not have symptoms. That is why it is important for children to practice social distancing and hand-washing, even if they do not appear ill.It is generally believed to cause milder symptoms in children, but the specific impacts by age are becoming clearer as the outbreak goes on.That remains unknown. Dr Jay C Butler, deputy director of infectious disease at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, “The phenomenon is very significant,” on a live-streamed show hosted by the Journal of the American Medical Association, but that the mechanisms are “really unknown”.People aged 60 and older or with existing health conditions remain the most vulnerable to the coronavirus. That includes people with conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory conditions, according to the WHO.Respiratory conditions such as asthma often result in more severe cases of viral diseases such as influenza. But the coronavirus is new, and it remains unknown whether it will more severely affect children with asthma.Similarly, there is not yet evidence about whether coronavirus could more negatively affect children with diabetes, which is a risk factor for adults. That said, experts at Johns Hopkins University are warning parents to be vigilant.In many countries that decision has been taken out of the hands of parents, with school and educational establishments being closed by governments and local authorities in order to try and halt the spread of the virus.If your kids are at home, they will still need regular exercise – and will need to be practising social distancing when they are outside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae86e7737e95ad969e38310c91b496c248963b04/0_380_5741_3447/master/5741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e134154da72007f2e7edf454c943d8e","title":"colombias narco submarines a photo essay","story":"For years, they were referred to in hushed tones simply as “Big Foot” – a mythical creature rumored but never seen – but these days, the narco-submarines used by Colombia’s drug cartels have become almost commonplace.Photographs by Luis RobayoAFP, written by Florence PanoussianAFPWith cocaine production at an almost record high in Colombia, authorities on the country’s Pacific coast say crude semi-submersible craft have become a favoured tool to smuggle drugs toward the US, and even to Europe.Thirty-three submarines were intercepted in 2019, an average of almost three a month, most of them along the Pacific coast. That is a major concern for Hernando Enrique Mattos Dager, the rear admiral in charge of the Colombia’s Poseidon taskforce against drug traffickingThe rudimentary submarines, fashioned in secret workshops deep in the mangrove swamps of north-western Pacific coast, are notoriously difficult for navy patrols or radar to detect. They cruise “flush with the surface of the water, and the part that protrudes above the surface is very small,” Dager said.For all their recent success, Dager and his taskforce know that they have probably only encountered the tip of the iceberg. As with all interceptions of illicit drugs, the feeling once the initial euphoria subsides is that many more get through than are ever detected. The authorities seized 433 tonnes of cocaine in 2019, more than half by the navy, but production was estimated to be more than 1,000 tonnes.In November, a 22-metre semi-submersible vessel was intercepted on the other side of the Atlantic, off Spain’s Galician coast. It was carrying around three tonnes of cocaine, and two of its three crew members were reportedly from Ecuador.Evidence of the successes of Dager’s taskforce is littered among the mangrove roots around its base in the south-western port of Tumaco. The town is situated just north of the border with Ecuador in Nariño department, which has more land under coca cultivation than anywhere else in the country. It accounted for about a quarter of the 169,000 hectares (417,600 acres) under cultivation nationwide in 2018. Tumaco is known as “the pearl of the Pacific” for its stunning beaches, but it has also become a flashpoint in Colombia’s long fight against drug trafficking.Painted in blue, grey and pastel greens, the submarines’ fibreglass hulls appear to have more in common with Jules Verne’s Nautilus in his 19th-century novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea than a sophisticated seagoing submersible. But these low-profile boats are designed to take to the sea with their decks awash, carrying their cargo just beneath the waves and out of sight.Rumours that the cartels were using submarines began in the 1990s, and in 2006 the navy intercepted one off Costa Rica with 3.5 tonnes of cocaine on board.The cramped submarines are crewed by between two and four men, usually recruited from local fishing communities, often in Ecuador. If naval patrols discover them, the crew members “open valves to let in water and sink the vessel, sinking the evidence,” before jumping into the water, said Captain Victor Santos Pacheco, commander of the local coastguard, which often rescues crews from the sea.The vessels can reach Central America in two or three days. Those that head further north to the Mexican or US coast are replenished at sea with water, food and fuel, indicating elaborate logistics. Crew members can earn up to $50,000 (£43,000) for a long crossing, but see it as a risk worth taking, according to officials. “A kilo of cocaine is worth $30,000 on the streets of New York,” said Dager.The taskforce has recently seen evidence of an increase in the use of submarines to transport marijuana. “It could correspond to the fact that its consumption has been authorised in some countries,” said Dager. “This has opened up an interesting international market ... The production of marijuana in Colombia is very economical ... at $100 a kilo, and it sells for up to $7,000 in the US.”The cartels are constantly upping the ante in a cat-and-mouse game on the high seas. They are now using winged torpedo-like tubes known as “parasites” that are fixed to thehulls of large ships, Pacheco said. They also have a new tactic – a GPS-equipped “buoyed cargo” designed for clandestine recovery at sea.“Narco-trafficking is innovative. It never stops,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48474b0dd292449be1ab1aa9c86d33c8fd829f7/0_164_3494_2097/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7542d09677912030d129efe6197e377c","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are they and should i see a doctor covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 22 March, more than 339,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 14,700 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 5,400 fatalities. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 98,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19.Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms.So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? Australia spoke with Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician.He says almost all serious consequences of Covid-19 feature pneumonia.Wilson says people who catch Covid-19 can be placed into four broad categories.The least serious are those people who are “sub-clinical” and who have the virus but have no symptoms.Next are those who get an infection in the upper respiratory tract, which, Wilson says, “means a person has a fever and a cough and maybe milder symptoms like headache or conjunctivitis”.He says: “Those people with minor symptoms are still able to transmit the virus but may not be aware of it.”The largest group of those who would be positive for Covid-19, and the people most likely to present to hospitals and surgeries, are those who develop the same flu-like symptoms that would usually keep them off work.A fourth group, Wilson says, will develop severe illness that features pneumonia.The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.When people with Covid-19 develop a cough and fever, Wilson says this is a result of the infection reaching the respiratory tree – the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside.He says: “The lining of the respiratory tree becomes injured, causing inflammation. This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough.“But if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages.“If they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacs that are at the bottom of our lungs.”He says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body’s ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.“That’s the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,” he says.Prof Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told  Australia: “Unfortunately, so far we don’t have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia.“People are already trialling all sorts of medications and we’re hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn’t any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care.“We ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.”Wilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics.“In some situations that isn’t enough,” he says of the current outbreak. “The pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.”Jenkins says Covid-19 pneumonia is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for.“Most types of pneumonia that we know of and that we admit people to hospital for are bacterial and they respond to an antibiotic.Wilson says there is evidence that pneumonia caused by Covid-19 may be particularly severe. Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts.But Wilson says this “first responder mechanism” can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly.Jenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under.“Age is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia.“It’s important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997e78d3d82a037cfcf5e0082db3236aa01cf0b8/0_203_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=363c75f5bae3dbe1f46f1a2fbe4ff180","title":"covid 19 government suspends rail franchise agreements","story":"Emergency measures will be in place for six months to avoid train companies collapsingBritain’s trains have effectively been nationalised, at least temporarily, after the government suspended rail franchise agreements to avoid train companies collapsing because of the coronavirus.Under emergency measures announced by the Department for Transport (DfT), train operators have been offered the chance to transfer “all revenue and cost risk” to the government and be paid a small management fee to continue running services.The industry body the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said it “strongly welcomes” the proposals, which boosted the share prices of listed companies with rail franchises, such as FirstGroup and Go-Ahead.While the measures are temporary, they nonetheless signal the permanent end of the UK’s complex rail franchising system, which was already likely to be abolished by the government commissioned Williams review.The emergency protocol will be in place for an initial period of six months, the DfT said, in order to “minimise disruption to the rail sector”.Allowing operators to enter insolvency would cause “significantly more disruption to passengers and higher costs to the taxpayer”, the department added.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns.

The advice was updated on Sunday to include “second homes, campsites, caravan parks”.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “We are taking this action to protect the key workers who depend on our railways to carry on their vital roles, the hardworking commuters who have radically altered their lives to combat the spread of coronavirus and the frontline rail staff who are keeping the country moving.“People deserve certainty that the services they need will run or that their job is not at risk in these unprecedented times.“We are also helping passengers get refunds on advance tickets to ensure no one is unfairly out of pocket for doing the right thing.“These offers will give operators the confidence and certainty so they can play their part in the national interest.”The department said fees paid to rail firms by the government during the emergency measures were intended to incentivise them to meet performance targets and the maximum fee attainable will be “far less than recent profits earned by train operators”.The RDG chief executive, Paul Plummer, said: “The industry strongly welcomes the Department for Transport’s offer of temporary support and, while we need to finalise the details, this will ensure that train companies can focus all their efforts on delivering a vital service at a time of national need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e1cf5671c0f0be3d1005ba2ca07f9f0ef74f7fa/0_112_3107_1864/master/3107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7ade74f90fd73ae4b8c366a631db489","title":"harvey weinstein tests positive for coronavirus","story":"Disgraced film producer placed in isolation at correctional facility in New York stateHarvey Weinstein, the former film producer who is serving a prison sentence for sexual assault and rape, has tested positive for coronavirus.The 68-year-old American has been placed in isolation at Wende correctional facility in New York state, said Michael Powers, the president of the state’s Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association.Powers said he learned the test came back positive on Sunday morning and was concerned about the corrections officers, who he said lack proper protective equipment. Several staff have been quarantined, Powers said.Weinstein arrived at Wende correctional facility, a maximum security prison east of Buffalo, on Wednesday after being housed at New York City’s Rikers Island jail.He was sentenced to 23 years in prison on 11 March for sexually assaulting the former production assistant Miriam Haley and raping a woman whom the  is not naming because her wishes over identification are not clear.Following the sentencing, Weinstein spent time at Bellevue hospital in Manhattan for heart problems, according to his spokesman, Juda Engelmayer.

The official said he could not comment on any inidual prisoner’s medical record.The official told Reuters that, with each confirmed case, the department of corrections works with the department of health to identify potentially exposed people.Mark David Chapman, who murdered Beatle John Lennon in 1980, served some of his time at Wende, as did Robert Chambers, dubbed the “Preppie killer”, who strangled 18-year-old Jennifer Levin in Central Park in New York in 1986.Weinstein’s conviction was hailed as a victory for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct by powerful men.More than 100 women, including a number of famous actors, accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. He has denied the allegations, saying any sex was consensual.Weinstein also faces separate sexual assault charges in Los Angeles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d4393451b04167d3c7c68138f0d95efba62ebf9/0_219_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=203da066e77fd964b4b7e285db768d2c","title":"hundreds of filipino health workers isolated indonesia thailand malaysia singapore cambodia myanmar coronavirus cases rise in south east asia","story":"Indonesian capital shuts entertainment venues to prevent spread and cases spike in Thailand and Cambodia More than 670 Filipino health workers have been quarantined over fears they were exposed to coronavirus, while others have resorted to using bin bags for protection as case numbers rise across much of south-east Asia.More than 50 million people in the Philippines remain under lockdown, while the country’s medical facilities struggle with a lack of testing kits and shortages of protective equipment. Two major hospitals in the capital – the Medical City and the University of Santo Tomas Hospital – have quarantined at total of 674 health workers over fears they have been exposed to the virus, placing additional strain on wards. Across the country, two doctors are confirmed to have died.“It is painful for us to hear about their deaths. This is the reality we face. We are risking our lives as we fulfil our duties,” Maria Theresa Depano, health staff at a hospital outside  Manila, said.Across the region, countries have registered a wave of recent cases, including in Indonesia, where president Joko Widodo acknowledged last week that there was a need to immediately ramp up testing. Fearing an influx of patients, the country has turned the athlete’s village built for the 2018 Asian Games into an emergency hospital with a capacity to hold more than 4,000 people.Indonesia, which has been criticised for being slow to respond to the outbreak, has so far recorded 48 deaths and 514 infections. As in the Philippines, the death toll has prompted speculation that the number of cases is higher than official records suggest. Earlier this month, the country of 264 million people had carried out only a few hundred tests.In the Philippines, 396 cases have been registered, including 33 deaths, but thousands more patients are suspected to have the virus.Depano shared photos of health workers using bin bags to protect themselves at the Saint Jude hospital in Laguna. “We are calling the attention of DOH (department of health) or other agencies that may provide us personal protective equipment. We’ve run out of supplies and we don’t know where we can buy,” she said in her post.As hospitals in Manila appealed for donations, health officials said the lack of equipment was due to global supply shortages, rather than a lack of funding. The country was receiving money from international donors, they said.In the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus were rolled out from Monday morning, after the city’s governor Anies Baswedan declared a state of emergency for the next two weeks. All entertainment venues have been shut, and businesses urged to close their offices where possible.Anies said on Friday that he would also limit the number of passengers boarding public transport, and reduce the operational hours. Photos shared on social media, showing cramped train carriages packed with commuters, suggest such limits aren’t yet working.Widodo has so far resisted calls for a lockdown in virus-hit areas of the country, despite the tough restrictions introduced elsewhere in the region. Malaysia, which confirmed 1,306 cases as of Sunday, introduced a two-week lockdown last week after a sudden spike in cases. The majority of these new infections are linked to a mass rally at a mosque in Kuala Lumpur, which was attended by 16,000 people earlier this month. Ten deaths have been recorded.The number of confirmed infections has also risen sharply in Thailand, which reported 122 new coronavirus cases on Monday, taking the total to 721. In the capital, Bangkok, almost all businesses have been ordered to shut, prompting tens of thousands of workers to board buses to leave the city this weekend.It is feared that the vast numbers of people on the move could spread the disease to provinces elsewhere in Thailand, or to countries including Cambodia or Myanmar, where many migrant workers are returning.On Myanmar’s borders, people queued to be scanned by health teams as the entered the country. Officials maintain that there are no cases of coronavirus in Myanmar, a claim that has prompted questions over testing and surveillance measures. In Cambodia, which until recently had recorded few cases, 31 new infections were reported on Sunday, 29 of them among French tourists, bringing the country’s total to 84.Cases imported by travellers from abroad are a growing concern in Vietnam, which initially appeared to have contained the virus, before infections linked to international flights emerged in the country.On Sunday, 19 new coronavirus cases were confirmed, bringing the Vietnam’s tally to 113. Last week, anticipating the return of Vietnamese people from virus-hit countries, officials announced they had expanded the quarantined facilities so there is enough space for as many as 60,000 people. The country has also said it will temporarily suspend entry to almost all foreigners who have already obtained travel visa.Singapore, which recorded its first two coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday, also stepped up entry restrictions, stating that it would close its borders to short-term visitors and some foreign labourers.The measures follow warnings from the World Health Organisation, which called for countries in south-east Asia to introduce “more aggressive and whole of society efforts” to stop the spread of the coronavirus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2334ebc282ee72dce6e24f35e19d8ff4960e7ddb/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c495ae2fbc4921ab852f22646311ed4","title":"parents heeding calls to keep children home from school say heads","story":"Teachers say number of pupils arriving at schools is largely manageableParents across England have largely heeded calls to keep their children at home on the first day of new emergency provision in schools during the coronavirus crisis, according to early feedback from headteachers.School leaders worked frantically over the weekend, contacting parents to find out which pupils were in need of a place and to encourage families where possible to keep their children safe at home, amid complaints of a lack of clarity and leadership from central government.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.Their efforts appeared to have paid off on Monday morning, with some headteachers reporting that staff vastly outnumbered pupils – in one secondary school there were five teachers for every student.There had been fears that schools providing a skeleton childcare service for children of key workers in the fight against Covid-19, as well as the most vulnerable pupils, would be inundated with students.Vic Goddard, co-principal of Passmores Academy, in Harlow, Essex, spoke for many heads when he said he felt both scared and angry about the challenges facing headteachers, and complained about lack of leadership from the government.In a tweet on Sunday, he said: “Been asking for help from govt all day. I am angry, frustrated and scared. I’m being asked to make life and death decisions for my own and other’s families.”Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said initial feedback from members indicated parents had heeded calls to use the emergency provision in schools only in the event that they are key workers who have no option available to keep their children at home.“Schools are reporting that the number of pupils arriving is manageable. We are grateful to parents for their understanding.”Richard Sheriff, executive headteacher and chief executive of the Red Kite Alliance, which runs nine primary schools and four secondary schools across Leeds and north Yorkshire said early signs were that demand for secondary schools was low, but children were turning up at primaries in greater numbers.At Temple Moor high school in Leeds, just eight students out of 1,200 turned up first thing on Monday morning, where they were dramatically outnumbered by around 40 staff, while at Western primary school in Harrogate, 44 children walked through the school gates.Andy Ramanandi, head teacher at St Joseph’s Catholic primary school in Blaydon, Gateshead, said he and colleagues had worked hard over the weekend to inform parents that where possible all children should be kept home.Their efforts paid off with just 12 pupils in school on Monday. “We’re making sure our children are having a great time,” said Ramanandi, who has two children of his own being cared for at another school. “We’ve just done the Joe Wicks work out. We are not a school. We are not here to educate children. We are providing childcare.”Elsewhere, however, he said there were concerns that some parents were sending in children who shouldn’t be there. “I’m picking up lots of frustration from headteachers that people are sending their children in unnecessarily when we suspect there’s someone at home to look after those children,” said Ramanandi.Just 14 children out of 420 turned up at Hartford Manor primary school in Cheshire, after initial fears that as many as 130 might claim a place. “We’ve very much been on the front foot on this one,” said headteacher Simon Kidwell, who said all parents had been asked to consider, “Is your job corona critical?”Kidwell described his new-look school, with no uniforms, no lessons and very few students. “It just feels very calm and lovely – a bit of an oasis. Children have never had this experience before, where they get to to just play in their primary school. It’s going to be strange. I’m no longer a headteacher, I’m a leader of a play scheme.”But he warned about the urgent need of keeping in close contact with all pupils at home including those with special needs. “If we don’t get this right it’s going to rip through families and it’s going to rip through communities.”Schools will not be expected to take a normal attendance register, but will be asked to submit a daily report stating whether they are open and how many children and staff are in school so capacity can be tracked, the Department for Education said.The department has also published guidance on vulnerable children, with schools being asked to have a process in place to check on the welfare of any children in need who do not continue to come to school, to ensure they do not fall through the gaps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08dc836afa0a2578f1e8fee9c60110bfbc7d1613/0_220_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2206cf48608d691384bf86acddf63803","title":"coronavirus rich countries poor west covid 19 developing world","story":"Horror over the west’s failure to contain Covid-19 will pale by comparison if it sweeps the developing worldThough Africa has fewer coronavirus cases and a slower rate of infection than the UK, many countries in the continent have passed dramatically more extreme measures to prevent its spread than Britain has. In my birth country of Sudan, after only one case and one death was registered, all schools and universities were shut down. Several other nations, such as Egypt, have taken the ultimate precaution and closed their airports.There is no denial here, no mixed messaging, and no unfounded promise of how soon we will send the virus packing.The tough and timely action is borne less out of political maturity than it is bitter experience, and an awareness that already overburdened public healthcare systems cannot sustain an onslaught. The ebola epidemic of 2014 is still fresh in the mind in sub-Saharan African countries it was an experience that showed prevention and containment are the only hope of fending off thousands of deaths.If we are concerned about the failure to contain the virus in western Europe and the US, multiples of that horror await in the developing world. With few means of medical intervention, and several other risk factors such as malnutrition, high population densities, communal living and lack of access to water and washing facilities, the rates of mortality could dwarf what has been seen so far in the west. And economically, the virus risks ushering in an ice age. There are no war chests, no stimulus packages, no insurance payouts.There is something painfully predictable about how coronavirus was introduced to the continent. Well-off travellers to the rest of the world returned from holidays and business trips carrying the virus, as did infected tourists. In Egypt, the first cases of Covid-19 appear to be linked to one cruise ship, where locals who served the tourists contracted the disease.The spread of the virus on the continent sits in the crosscurrents of travel and financial flows that expose African countries to the sharp end of globalisation – one where the flow of people is encouraged into the continent for business and tourism, and severely restricted out of the continent even for the wealthy and well connected.It is the recurring theme of how the pandemic has played out so far. The poor, the uninsured, the disenfranchised, the information-poor and the less mobile are sitting ducks. Many western economies, including the US and the UK, have slowly pushed these people to the margins, while restricting employment benefits such as holiday pay, sick leave, and private insurance to an increasingly exclusive class. One of the reasons the British and US governments have been so slow to provide free testing, medical care and bailouts for those who’ve lost work is that these inequalities are now hardwired into the system. They cannot be undone overnight even when lives depend on it.The global economy is set up in much the same way, with winners who hoard the spoils, and losers who scratch around for the leftovers. If wealthy single countries cannot scramble to save their own people, there is no hope for any effort to extend help to countries with a fraction of the resources.But here is the tragic catch for those who think that this structural imbalance is not our problem. In this instance, national and international inequalities cannot persist without everyone losing. The realisation is just beginning to dawn upon lawmakers that the rich cannot be barricaded against the poor, no matter how high the barriers to the fortress are. Limiting the spread of the virus entails ensuring that everyone in the pool, be it local or global, is given the ability to test, self-isolate if need be, and receive treatment.Yes, to some extent this is a utopian aspiration. But it is also essentially pragmatic. We cannot extol the virtues of small government and global societies without grasping that the risk to the majority cannot be halted from spreading: viruses do not distinguish between classes and nationalities.Just as work and public life cannot be shuttered for ever, borders cannot be closed indefinitely. African countries are moving fast against coronavirus, well aware that they are on their own. But barring a miracle, or a pandemic Marshall plan by wealthier countries, if the virus explodes in poorer countries, the cataclysm will engulf everyone."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209720.1584964704!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"this is just the start of an unequal leaving cert for class of 2020","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh  delivers an update on this year’s Leaving Cert and Junior Cert exams.  Photograph: Crispin Rodwell Today I, like 56,000 other Leaving Cert students, would normally be getting ready for a seven- or eight-hour day at school with the aim of preparing for the most important exams of my life.However, today is not a typical day. Far from it. Because of Covid-19, schools have sent us home indefinitely, a difficult though necessary decision to keep us safe. When I first heard the news, I was shocked. Being told to gather all books from my locker and to head home came as an unwelcome surprise 10 days out from the Leaving Cert orals. I began to worry, which was unusual for me, but I knew the significance of this closure. Rather than looking at the negatives, I put my head down and got to work, which seemed like the only solution with absolutely no news of what would be happening to the exams. CancelledTen days on and, as we all know, the Minister for Education cancelled these exams and awarded full marks to every student. A range of mixed emotions came with this decision: disappointment, because I had put in countless hours in preparation, and relief, because some of the uncertainty had vanished. Whether you were happy or not with this decision, I think it is safe to say that it comes with an advantage for some and a disadvantage for others, and I believe this is just the start of an unequal 2020 Leaving Cert.Apart from the orals, the fact that students taking subjects such as music, for example, have been awarded full marks for their practical exam, is baffling.These students are starting off a Leaving Cert exam with a H5 already secured before putting pen to paper compared to the vast majority of others beginning at zero. It is, quite simply, inequitable. We shouldn’t have any cause to debate whether some of us have been advantaged or disadvantaged when it comes to the Leaving Cert exams. These measures cause significant stress for us students across the country as we all wonder how it will affect our results, as well as the marking “bell curve”, and how it could be the difference between being accepted for a PLC, apprenticeship or college course.Incredible work is being done by teachers and staff to help us through these uncertain times. Notes, assignments and teaching videos certainly help ease some of the pressure, but it is incomparable to being in school with a set structure of classes. ClosuresI work hard at school and always put in as much time and effort into my studies knowing that with hard work, my desired course is within reach.Unfortunately, since these school closures, my progress has not been the same. It is incredibly difficult to follow a strict plan and to stay motivated with so many distractions at home. I can only imagine what these times must be like for students who already find it hard to stay motivated while at school.For less engaged students, the only learning that they pick up is often within the school week. On top of this, many have unreliable internet access and inadequate technology.In some cases, students cannot access the notes that are being distributed by teachers. Others must become primary caregivers for younger siblings whose schools have also closed while parents try to make ends meet. Many fear that their loved ones could be among the thousands who will die from the virus in the coming months. And those who fall ill are not the only people affected: since family businesses have already shut and livelihoods lost. In one of the most significant years of our lives, the reality is that the Leaving Cert is no longer the primary concern as there are more substantial problems ahead of us. Frighteningly, the students who are hurt most severely by Covid-19 might not be able to meet academic standards at all, potentially failing their Leaving Cert.SolutionsIn these difficult times, we are all doing the best we can with the little we have. No, this situation is not perfect, and there are no ideal solutions, but we need some more information quickly. The current plan to continue with the written exams in June is not possible in my eyes. With the Taoiseach saying school closures could last into the summer months, I don’t see how such a situation is possible. These months off school are not the same as being in school, and time will need to be allocated in summer months to complete unfinished courses if there is any intention of the Leaving Cert going ahead. Unfortunately, this situation is only going to get worse, and the Government must make decisions sooner rather than later. Whether that is predicted results like the A-Levels with the option of sitting the exams in autumn for dissatisfied students or, at a minimum, announcing a structured plan if these exams are to go ahead, we need answers!

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe parents of  journalist Glen Murphy, who is recovering from coronavirus, have been left waiting for days for test results despite showing symptoms of the disease and having had contact with their son.Murphy was diagnosed on Sunday, March 15th and immediately went into self-isolation at home. His symptoms have largely abated since then.On Friday, his mother was admitted to hospital with pneumonia and was tested for coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, the following day. At the time of writing on Monday, she had not yet received her test results.His father has also experienced mild symptoms associated with the virus but was not tested until last Monday morning, eight days after his son’s diagnosis.At a briefing on Sunday, the HSE’s chief operations officer, Anne O’Connor, said the average waiting period for a test was four to five days.HSE chief executive Paul Reid has acknowledged that delays in testing had begun to build up and that thousands more testing kits would be distributed this week.“I just can’t understand how people in such close proximity to a known case aren’t prioritised,” Murphy told Deputy Editor Deirdre Veldon.He waited for three days to be tested after developing symptoms, being told his case was not a priority as he had not travelled to what were then the affected areas. Since then, HSE criteria for testing have changed. Anyone displaying normal cold and flu symptoms is instructed to self-isolate at home and call their GP who will advise on their need for testing.The arrival at his apartment of medics in protective attire was shocking, he said. “I was expecting the person to be in the full getup but when you see them standing in front of you, it’s a very different experience. It does nail it home that you’re a statistic in a global pandemic.”He provided the names of approximately 40 people he was in contact with in the days before his diagnosis.“I assumed every single person I was in touch with would be tested.That’s not the case at all.Even while suffering from the worst of the illness, Murphy’s main concern has been for the wellbeing of his parents.“The hardest part no doubt has been worrying about my mam, since she went into hospital, it’s just very uncharacteristic for anyone in my family to be in hospital,” he said.He urged people to keep their distance from others. “Social distance rules exist for a reason, they will absolutely save lives of people who are more vulnerable to this disease.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph Jonathan Bradshaw.The Government will seek to keep public spaces such as parks, forests and beaches open for people to use but will emphasise the need for everyone to maintain social distancing.Four people have died and there are currently 906 positive cases of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, in Ireland. At a briefing at Government Buildings this morning, a senior official said that the Government would consult with national parks, Coillte, the Heritage Council and local authorities “to develop clear, simple public messaging so we can continue to enjoy these public spaces at this time”.Elizabeth Canavan, an assistant secretary in the Department of the Taoiseach, told journalists that the Government had received “significant feedback from the public in relation to the lack of social distancing”.“It’s clear that that the vast majority of people are complying with the guidelines, but clearly compliant is not universal,” she said.She said the Government would seek to keep public spaces open while reinforcing the need to keep distance between people.Ms Canavan also said anyone who applied for social welfare payments last week would receive a payment in their bank accounts tomorrow. However, she warned that scammers are contacting people purporting to be from the Department of Social Protection asking for bank details.“You will not get a phone call asking for your bank details from the Government,” she said. Social protection payments would be made every two weeks, she said.Ms Canavan also said that immigration applications would now move online, and the immigration offices in Dublin had now closed.Further restrictionsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar indicated the Government is not thinking in terms of implementing severe restrictions on movement at this moment in time but may impose some further restrictions. Mr Varadkar responded to scenes over the weekend where parks and public places - especially in Co Dublin and Co Wicklow - became very crowded by saying that people had probably gone to those places not expecting such large crowds. “In fairness to those people they probably turned up not realising how crowded they were going to be,” he said. “I don’t think we should be berating people about this. We have asked the Chief Medical Officer and the National Public Emergency Team to examine that with a view to coming up with more recommendations for Government tomorrow. “If they recommend further restrictions we will implement them,” he said. Mr Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris both emphasised the evidence emerging from contact tracing teams of the social distancing measures having already had an impact. “Most people most of the time are adhering to social distancing,” said Mr Varadkar. “We see some evidence in the contact tracing that that is the case,” he said. He said any decision that will be made on social restrictions “will not be made because of what is trending on Twitter, because of populism or political pressure”.He said it would be based solely on expert advice. Earlier on Monday morning, Mr Harris said social distancing is not “something nice to do, it is about saving lives”. Ireland cannot go the way of Italy, he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.It was important to look after people’s physical and mental health, but mass gatherings in parks were “not on”, he said.Mr Harris said he had been overwhelmed by the sense of solidarity being displayed around the country and also by the dedication of those in the health service. The welfare of health care workers was key and everyone needed to work “extremely hard” to protect health workers.When asked about the possibility of further restrictions, Mr Harris said people were making a conscious effort at social distancing. He said he would await greater guidance about playgrounds and public spaces. People still need to abide by social distancing, he said. People must stay two metres apart.The president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, Dr Mary Favier, has said it was inevitable that more measures will be introduced to ensure physical distancing.Dr Favier told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that “physical distancing” was a much better description than “social distancing” and that more needed to be done as “particular groups” did not seem to understand the necessity for physical distancing.It was up to us as a society to make the personal decision to create a physical distance rather than to have to introduce mandatory measures, she said. Ultimately it was people in the community who would save lives, doctors would “pick up the pieces.”Back logDr Favier acknowledged there was a significant back log on testing, but pointed out that GPs could not expedite tests or results which would go directly to patients. “We would ask people not to ring their GP, we don’t have the information.”However, she said that anyone who developed respiratory symptoms or anyone who was awaiting testing and their symptoms got worse should immediately contact their GP.Testing for health care professionals was vital, added Dr Favier as there was already a shortage of GPs in the country and the health service could not afford to have GPs going into isolation while awaiting testing.Speaking on Newstalk, Mr Harris said orders of face masks, goggles and gowns were being packed up in China and an airline was going to collect them, they should arrive by the end of the week. On the issue of wait times for tests – Mr Harris said the changed criteria for testing had brought about huge pressures. Efforts were under way to get more testing kits, there are now far more testing centres and there are 10 labs around the country running the tests.“We are testing, testing, testing, but the most important thing is that if you think you have the symptoms you must self-isolate.

Image: Screengrab of Twitter videoFish-and-chip shop chain Beshoff Bros has announced that it is closing all its stores with immediate effect after footage showed customers were not following social distancing guidelines outside its shop in Howth on Sunday.Video and photographs appeared on social media showing long queues of customers who did not appear to be adhering to guidelines aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19.The World Health Organisation and the HSE have urged people to leave at least 2m between themselves and others while avoiding crowded places.One person on Twitter posted video footage from his car showing the lines of people. “Q for fish and chips in Howth. Absolutely disgraceful. And then we wonder why people are getting sick.”Beshoff Bros general manager Bridget Starbuck said staff in its Howth premises had attempted to introduce social distancing measures by letting only one person at a time into the shop.“The amount of abuse we have been getting since last night has been disheartening,” she told The .“It’s incredibly difficult because the staff did not want to go out and talk to people who were shouting abuse back.“We had marked the areas where people had to stand. They had to stand behind yellow lines. If I look at our own cameras, people were keeping their distances.“I don’t think we should be targeted. I don’t think it is right when the beaches and everything else was full.”Ms Starbuck added: “We never saw a sign of one single guard yesterday at all. There was no sign. Why didn’t they close Howth off if Howth was so busy?”Ms Starbuck said that if the Government wanted takeaways such as theirs to close down, it should say so. However: “It is not fair if we close and other people are open.”In a statement on its social media accounts issued on Monday morning, Beshoff Bros said it has been an “incredibly difficult time for all of our staff”.“We wanted to thank all of our staff who have been working hard to try and provide for our local communities and we’d like to thank our customers for their support during this difficult time.“We hope that everyone stays safe and healthy and we hope to open our doors to you all very soon.”Customers will instead be able to order for delivery through Uber Eats or beshoffbros.orderyoyo.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4204988.1584444197!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"share your covid 19 story have you lost your job or business","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA shopper wearing a face mask on Grafton Street, Dublin last weekend.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus Q\u0026ampA: What can we learn from Europe?Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson set to order closure of all ‘non-essential’ shops Comment: Rail franchises had their day long before the coronavirus crisisLondon\u0026#39s Excel Centre considered as field hospital to help coronavirus outbreak Coronavirus deaths rising faster in UK than ItalyCoronavirus testing: how many people are being tested in the UK - and how does it compare to other countries? London lockdown: Are shops closed, is the Tube running and can I leave the house? Comment: Let\u0026#39s believe in Britain and lead the world in the fight against coronavirusWho is on the list of key workers?

The non-binary singer who insists on gender-neutral pronouns (“Theythem”) posted a video clip of themselves having what my dad would have called “the ab-dabs” on social media this week. Having selflessly entered self-isolation at their £12 million home on Thursday, by Friday they were weeping like a girl (sorry, like an assigned at birth cis female) because they were already bored with their own company.“I hate reading!”, they confessed, suggesting that if you have no life of the mind you’ll always be a bad friend to yourself – even if you do refer yourself in the plural.But it could be worse Smith could have joined the other celebrities treating us to their own stardust-sprinkled version of the ghastly John Lennon song Imagine.I’ve had “issues” with this song forever, summing up perfectly as it does Lennon’s weapons-grade hypocrisy. While encouraging the hoi polloi to “imagine no possessions”, he and his consort kept a whole apartment in the Dakota building where they lived in New York for the exclusive occupation of their fur coats, just to keep them at the right temperature.Elton John nailed it in his autobiography: “The various apartments the Lennons owned … were so full of priceless artworks, antiques and clothes that I once sent them a card, rewriting the lyrics to Imagine: Imagine six apartments, it isn’t hard to do, one is full of fur coats, another’s full of shoes.’’In fact, Lennon was forever ready to take his non-specific rage out on someone, provided, of course, that person was powerless. In his actions – as opposed to his statements and his songs – he exhibited largely selfishness and spite. To be fair, the new Imagineers aren’t in the same camp as Lennon. They’re lovely to look at (Wonder Women from Lynda Carter to Gal Gadot, actresses Natalie Portman and Cara Delevingne) and extremely accomplished (songwriter Sia, singer Norah Jones, comic Will Ferrell) and they mean well.But scratch a showboating altruist and you’ll often find an attention whore I know, because I’m one. I get to show off in print and I’m good at it, but performers in other areas can’t do their thing alone. It’s driving them nuts that no one’s looking at them, hence Michele Pfeiffer posted a video of herself working out while Bob Geldof rang up a TV show to announce his own self-isolation.It’s touching to look at celebrities and see how unconscious they are of their vulnerability George Michael, who knew about these things, once defined a star as “someone with a little something missing rather than a little something extra”.They need their fans – but their fans do not need them although they may momentarily enjoy their singing voices or good looks. When the famous attempt to parlay this passing fancy into actual power, it falls flat each time a celebrity urged people not to vote for Trump or Brexit, it seems they caused another thousand to do so.And they will be heeded less than ever as we plunge deeper into the plague year. Gadot said that she had been inspired by the Italian videos of neighbours singing to each other on their balconies ironically it’s this development that shows how superfluous stars are.Transcendence was just around the corner all along – and we don’t need to pay for it. Like the tree falling in the metaphorical forest, when a star smiles and no “civilian” watches, does the star still feel happiness?I’m sure we will see much more of them getting their flashing-fix in the guise of giving something to the Little People before we’re out from under lockdown.But eventually even these most unrealistic of beings will realise that the achievements of the rich and famous count for nothing in a new world in which those who do the most arduous and thankless labour are – at long last – the most honoured. We will look back in wonder that we once called dress designers ‘visionaries’ and disc jockeys ‘superstars.’At a time singularly short of silver linings, this must be one.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Soft-boiled eggs, hard-boiled eggs, scrambled eggs – and where in the whole of London we could find the city’s last carton of precious, best-laid eggs.“Got any eggs?” were my husband’s first words when he rang his parents yesterday. Not an egg to be had in all of Berkshire. Two girlfriends, one pregnant, one breastfeeding, both depleted, tell of kind neighbours leaving bubble-wrapped eggs on the doorstep.I am kicking myself for not buying the only option left on the shelves in Waitrose on Friday: a single packet of quail’s eggs. It felt a bit Marie Antoinette-ish in the face of a global pandemic. My editor reports a similar dilemma faced by her uncle at Portobello Market: duck eggs or bust. On Saturday morning, after a fruitless – or should that be yolkless? – search of six shops, I came home with a bottle of Fairy Liquid and a bunch of hyacinths. Very cheering, but not much cop on toast. Hen’s eggs have become as rare as hen’s teeth.Who bought all the eggs? Who on Sunday morning sat down to a five-egg frittata? Who is broodily clucking over their hoard while the rest of us go without?I’m still horrified by a conversation three years ago with my driving instructor about his diet. Each morning, he boiled six eggs, cut them in half, scooped out and threw away the yolks, and ate the whites. It was appalling then, unforgivable now.After a week without omelettes, some are panic-buying bantams. (Insert joke about headless chickens here.) Poultry breeders report soaring sales. Rosehill Hatchery in Hanningfield, Essex, sold 300 hens in just two days. On Thursday, it shut up coop. Sales of the “Eglu” – a chicken igloo – are up 66 per cent in Europe and the US. Looking out at the fire escape, six floors up in central London, I wonder whether it is practical to recreate The Good Life in Paddington. Perhaps not.May the nation’s Leghorns, Orpingtons and Lincolnshire Buffs rise to the occasion. Girls, get laying! Your country urgently, hungrily needs you.Talking of girls cooped up together, the BBC is to bring forward its adaptation of Enid Blyton’s Malory Towers boarding school books to entertain children starting what promises to be a very long Easter holiday. Raise your lacrosse sticks in a sabre arch, here come Darrell, Sally, Alicia, Gwendoline, Mary-Lou and Mam’zelle Dupont the French mistress.Raise your lacrosse sticks in a sabre arch: here come the Malory Towers girlsThe BBC is billing the series as a tale of female empowerment (golly) and not, as I had hitherto thought, an innocent celebration of bagsied desks, beastly tricks, dormy games and saggy swimsuits. What would the BBC producers think of my childhood spent playing First Term At Mallory Towers with pneumatic Barbie dolls cast as the “feminist role models” Darrell, Sally and Mary-Lou? (I wasn’t the wokest of six-year-olds.)Still, the resolute jolliness of the North Tower girls could prove an inspiration in these anxious times. Anyone caught moping about loo roll, cancelled flights or cabin fever should be silenced with a rousing: “Cheer up, Gwendoline!” And all stockpilers are to be immediately punished with lashings of extra prep.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

They’ve not been back to the UK. Libya is quite a difficult place to do anything with at the moment. “It was difficult enough getting Hashem Abedi back. I think we have to be very careful about how we approach people in Libya. We have not spoken to the parents.“We have made requests of Libyan authorities in relation to other areas of the investigation. Clearly there are circumstances about  the management of the parental home, circumstances about the management of the finances that relate to that.”Following his release from detention in Tripoli, Ramadan moved back to a large rented property in the city.But the family were forced to flee their home after the area where they lived became a frontline in the latest round of fighting between Libya’s two main armed factions, the UN-backed Government of National Accord and the rival Libyan National Army.They relocated to another rented property in the Libyan capital, but refused to discuss the attack by their sons.One local Libyan journalist told The  that Ramadan had regularly been seen around Tripoli often seen drinking tea in local cafes, but had been making regular trips to Istanbul for medical treatment.His hospital bills are understood to be paid for by the Libyan government, for whom he worked in the past as a civil servant in the Ministry of Interior.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/22/TELEMMGLPICT000228365598_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBDCnIxthzPLaVuHdTEmpqJRQxFEnemAQdOy_hncTgwo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"necessity proves mother invention coronavirus torn country","story":"Zac looks through the window at Vera Barnett after delivering a carvary from the Sneyd Arms on Mother\u0026#39s Day in Keele, Newcastle-under-Lyme Mother’s Day 2020. At once a deeply heart-rending and unexpectedly uplifting moment in these extraordinary times. The poignant absence of the nation’s mothers was the central focus.But the human, humane response from their children served as a tribute to Britain’s ingenuity and good humour, even in the grip of a deadly pandemic. Some spoke on the phone or waved through windows to their mums. Others harnessed modern technology and FaceTimed from their front rooms or went back to basics and asked their local radio station for a special dedication.Across the UK, families strove to find novel ways to spread good cheer rather than the coronavirus.On social media, David Kenworthy made light of stockpiling by tweeting “Best Mother’s Day gift ever. No 1 son” beside a screenshot of Andrex loo roll.Elsewhere, two sisters arrived at their mum’s house with a bouquet in full protective gear, including masks.A middle-aged woman was filmed several metres away from her elderly mother and holding up handwritten signs by way of homage to the scene in Love Actually some were brought to tears by the tenderness of the messages.Celebrities including Victoria Beckham, Amanda Holden, Piers Morgan and Ant and Dec went online to post throwback photographs of themselves with their mothers “in happier times”.And then there were snapshots of beaming children standing outside grandmothers’ houses and adults amiably drinking tea separated from their pensioner parent by the glass wall of the conservatory.Jennifer Grover, 84, a retired housewife and health worker from Sutton in Surrey, was “visited” by three of her 17 grandchildren via Skype. “We used it this morning for half an hour and that was lovely,” she said. “It was a new and very different experience.“It’s just because they haven’t been able to see me in person and it was the next best thing.”But despite the inventiveness and the smiles, Mothering Sunday has given us all pause for thought.Who could have imagined just six months ago that the simple act of visiting our own mothers would become a life or death decision?The coronavirus has changed the world. Changed us.On Sunday, as the Prime Minister urged the nation to stay indoors, and medical experts begged us to keep the elderly and the infirm safe, a generation of mothers sat home alone.There were no joyful family gatherings. No hand-delivered chocolates from prodigal sons. No fierce hugs and beribboned gifts from daughters. No inky home-made cards and fairy cakes from grandchildren.It was for their own good. Our own good. Society’s own good. That did not make it easy to bear.As James Mitchinson, editor of The Yorkshire Post, tweeted to his readers: “This #MothersDay you can give your mum something quite special. A few more years of life on this planet to enjoy their retirements, their grandchildren, the simple things.“Please don’t put them in grave danger for the sake of sentiment.”In London, Kensington Palace shared a message from Heads Together, their mental health charity, which asked people to get in touch with those who found Mother’s Day difficult, including those who have lost their mothers, their own children or could not be with them.It was a reminder that despite social distancing, we can – must – continue to connect in other ways. Sunday offered the perfect opportunity.Unlike Valentine’s Day with its exploitative blizzard of hearts and orchestrated schmaltz, the promotion of Mothering Sunday has always felt entirely benign.It represents a welcome nudge to remember the incredible, selfless women who birthed us, reared us and made us who we are. Some of us discover that we had no real inkling of how much, how unconditionally, our mothers loved us until we had children of our own.And so Mother’s Day has evolved into a unique and uniquely intimate date in the calendar. A harbinger of spring, it is reverently set aside for quiet joy green-tipped bulbs pushing through the dark earth of Marks \u0026amp Spencer planters, glasses of generic fizz (mothers invariably cavil at the extravagance of champagne) or a stroll around a National Trust property.Coronavirus UK and regional map ..Not this year. Stately piles are closed. The shops are deserted, restaurants have brought the shutters down in a bid to kill off Covid-19 before it wipes out a generation.With inventiveness and determination a great many of us joyfully marked Mother’s Day.But the bleak reality is that the risk we – any one of us – pose to our parents extends far beyond this one day. It reaches into tomorrow, next week, next month.If we can’t visit our mothers on Mother’s Day, when can we? That is the harrowing question nobody dares ask because nobody can answer.   The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Identity politics now feels like a madness from another age. Nobody is complaining about the gender balance of the team of experts guiding the nation’s response (well, nobody apart from Amber Rudd, who got short shrift when she made that point on Twitter last week).The war on coronavirus has, in part, made the war on plastic redundant. Reusable coffee cups were judged a health risk by cafés which, before they were ordered to close, required customers to return to the old disposable ones. In the United States, new regulations restricting the use of plastic bags are being suspended, and one mayor has even called for a ban on the American equivalent of “bags for life”, given that (unwashed) they could end up spreading this virus.There are whisperings that similar measures could follow here, with supermarkets reportedly urging the Government to waive the bag tax. Old, pointless regulations are being discarded -such as those preventing some pubs or restaurants from offering takeaways.This will only be the start. Over the past few decades, planning authorities, architects, and builders have conspired to ensure that the UK now has among the smallest new homes in Europe. Fine, this may partly be a consequence of higher population density, but then why are Dutch homes significantly bigger? As people coop up in self-quarantine, with little space for food and other essentials, one long-term consequence should be an end of policies that promote extreme densification.That ought to mean an expansion of suburbs, more garden cities and market towns outside of our major conurbations, and an end, too, to the blind assumption that the “agglomeration” of everything, or radical centralisation, is an unalloyed good. Social distancing is much less traumatic when people have their own gardens.A newly-germaphobic society will have less slavish respect for public transport over the hermetically-sealed personal motor vehicle. Is the Government going to push ahead with its premature ban on diesel, hybrid and petrol cars? Some changes will be less welcome. Expect privacy considerations to be given less weight in public policy decisions, especially those related to technology. This has already started, with governments openly tracking the movements of populations via their mobile phone signals, in order to monitor whether social distancing is being adhered to.Then there are all the faddish projects that, until just a few weeks ago, were animating our politics. Rightly or wrongly, ministers have chosen to destroy our economy (hopefully temporarily) in order to limit the spread of coronavirus. We have also discovered that we are not, really, in a significantly better position than countries that are much poorer and less developed. In the cold light of this new era, HS2 looks even more absurd. Are we really proposing to push ahead with a £100  billion-plus vanity project? Much that was certain now looks very decadent indeed.Politics latest news: Government buys one million face masks for NHS workers, as Matt Hancock vows to \u0026#39solve\u0026#39 supply issueParents struggle with homeschooling as they complain \u0026#39maths has changed\u0026#39 on first day of closuresCoronavirus Q\u0026ampA: What can we learn from Europe?Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson set to order closure of all ‘non-essential’ shops Comment: Rail franchises had their day long before the coronavirus crisisLondon\u0026#39s Excel Centre considered as field hospital to help coronavirus outbreak Coronavirus deaths rising faster in UK than ItalyCoronavirus testing: how many people are being tested in the UK - and how does it compare to other countries? London lockdown: Are shops closed, is the Tube running and can I leave the house? Comment: Let\u0026#39s believe in Britain and lead the world in the fight against coronavirusWho is on the list of key workers?

In return she “would be taken care of for the rest of her life”.However, she instead escaped during a trip to Thailand, according to a book written by American lawyer Bradley Edwards - who has represented Epstein’s victims.She had already been involved in the “sex cult” for over two years when she was asked to bear Epstein’s child, Mr Edwards claims in his book, Relentless Pursuit, which is being serialised in the Mail on Sunday.He describes how Epstein and Maxwell allegedly came up with a proposal that “turned her stomach” and included signing a contract agreeing that “the baby was not her own, but the legal child of Epstein and Maxwell”. Mr Edwards has represented Epstein’s victims for 11 years and “pursuing Epstein” on their behalf became his “life mission”, he writes in his book.He describes how Ms Giuffre Roberts was a “striking 16-year-old with drive and a determination to improve herself” when she was first approached by Maxwell in 1999 and given an envelope “with directions to Epstein’s address”.Mr Edwards writes that after arriving at the property, “Maxwell instructed her on every aspect of how to perform a massage” before Maxwell ended up “stripping off all her clothes and telling Virginia to do the same. Epstein then sexually assaulted Virginia. ‘Doesn’t that feel good?’ he asked.”Ms Giuffre Roberts would later show the lawyer the envelope, as well as “travel and hotel receipts charged to Epstein’s card”, as proof of some of her allegations.“Not long afterwards, Virginia showed me a photograph of herself, aged 17, wedged in between Maxwell and Andrew”, Mr Edwards claims in his book.It was two years later that Ms Giuffre Roberts was asked to carry Epstein and Maxwell’s baby. At that point, Mr Edwards writes, she “knew she had to escape”.The lawyer alleges that it was on a trip to Thailand, where Ms. Roberts Giuffre was dispatched to interview a “young girl, and let Epstein know if she was ‘qualified’”, that she fled and met an Australian man. The pair then married and flew back to Australia, where she had three children.Ms Roberts Giuffre, now 36, has claimed repeatedly that she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with the Duke when she was aged 17 at Ms Maxwell’s home in Belgravia, London.The Duke categorically denied her allegation during his Newsnight interview, insisting it “simply didn’t happen” and that on the day in question he was at a Pizza Express in Woking.He has also strongly denied having sex with Ms Giuffre Roberts in New York and on Epstein’s private island in the Virgin Islands.Earlier this month, The  revealed that Prince Andrew has hired Clare Montgomery QC, Britain’s most respected extradition lawyer, to fend off an FBI inquiry into his friendship with Epstein.Ms Montgomery’s clients have included Augusto Pinochet, Chile’s former dictator and Nirav Modi, wanted for India’s biggest fraud. She has been described as “the most formidable member of the bar.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rural residents tell visitors go home parks beauty spots packed","story":"A backlash against people ignoring social distancing saw people in rural communities telling visitors to go home on Sunday because parks and beauty spots were packed with visitors.Some tourist destinations and National Parks saw their busiest ever days over the weekend as people ignored the advice to stay two metres apart to enjoy the sunshine.In updated advice issued on Sunday, the culture department said essential travel does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays and that people should remain in their primary residence.The National Trust, the Royal Horticultural Society and a London council were among those that announced that they were to close all their venues as they could not guarantee the safety after visitor numbers spiked.The Mother\u0027s Day influx into parks and beaches even led to tourism boards asking people to stay away, with Visit Wales putting out the message: “Visit Wales. Later.”There are concerns that an increase in people travelling into rural communities, which already have a high proportion of elderly residents, will put unsustainable pressure on local health and social care services and shops.Some rural communities have warned that people are attempting to isolate themselves in remote areas amid petitions for caravan parks to be closed.Judy Murray, mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie Murray, tweeted a simple message to those relocating to the countryside - a picture of a car and trailer with Go home idiots and Covid-19 painted on the side.Other social media users shared pictures and videos of packed parks and car parks as they described people as “covidiots”Boris Johnson said that the Government would be thinking very actively in the next 24 hours about taking further measures to prevent social distancing.He told a press conference on Sunday that I don\u0027t want to do that as it is so important that people are able to go out, but said that freedom can only really be preserved if everybody acts responsibly and conforms with those principles of staying apart from one another and social distancing.The Prime Minister added that if people can\u0027t make use of parks and playgrounds in a way that observes 2 metre rule then we\u0027re going to have to look at further measuresThe National Trust said on Sunday that they would close all parks, gardens, houses, shops and cafes as well as car parks for countryside and coastal locations because of high demand.Director-general Hilary McGrady said the trust would be taking measures to ensure that people do not lose their connection with nature, and that the sites of natural beauty remain open virtually.Snowdonia National Park Authority said its area experienced its busiest ever visitor day in living memory on Saturday, with so many people that it was “impossible to maintain effective social distancing”.Chatsworth House, Whipsnade Zoo and the Yorkshire Wildlife Park also announced that it would be closing its doors.Some DIY stores and garden centres reported being busier than Bank Holiday weekends when visitor numbers are normally at their peak.Britain is not the first country to see a rush to beauty spots, with visitor destinations across the world being overwhelmed. The Australian Government this weekend closed Bondi Beach in Sydney because of overcrowding.But it was not just rural areas and beauty spots that experienced high numbers of visitors.Londoners were criticised for attending “packed” markets including in Victoria Park and the famous flower market on Colombia road.Hammersmith and Fulham council announced that as of 7pm last night (SUN) all the parks would be closed in the borough until further notice, adding: “Please stay home, save lives.”The Royal Parks closed their parks on the outskirts of London to all traffic and all their remaining takeway cafes and kiosks as “people are not adhering to social distancing guidelines”.A spokesman warned that they were keeping the situation under review and if the rules continue to be ignored “we will have no choice but to consider closing the parks”.Many are concerned that with London the worst hit and with the schools shut the situation in the countryside will get worse unless action is taken.Kate Forbes, SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, said that there “has been an influx of campervans and traffic with people living in cities to what they think is self-isolation. But this is not a wildness this is a place where people live.”George Freeman, MP for Mid Norfolk, tweeted: “To those people with 2nd homes in Norfolk: PLS DONT flee London to come to Norfolk” adding that they risked “spreading the virus”.Nicola Sturgeon yesterday moved to stem a flood of people into the Highlands trying to escape the coronavirus by barring them taking ferries to the islands and telling all accommodation providers to stop accepting visitors.The First Minister said all hotels, bed-and-breakfasts and self-catering providers should only be housing staff and essential workers, amid fears local rural hospitals could collapse under the pressure.First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford also warned: Social distancing includes avoiding all but essential travel and if people don\u0027t follow this advice we will have no choice but to use powers to enforce it.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"smell taste should included official list coronavirus symptoms","story":"The official list of coronavirus symptoms should be expanded to include loss of smell and taste, senior medics have demanded, as patients also report stomach pains and sore eyes.Ordering those with impared smell and taste to self-isolate could significantly slow the spread of Covid-19, the experts said.Currently, the government demands only that people with a persistent dry cough or a high temperature, or both, self-isolate for at least seven days to protect the wider public. However, specialist doctors say that in recent days they have been “inundated” with a wave of patients reporting the sudden loss - usually within 24 hours - of their sense of smell and taste.Only a minority have gone on to develop the formally recognised symptoms of Covid-19.Those who have called NHS 111 have allegedly been told they need not self-isolate.It is understood that the chief medical officer and SAGE, the scientific group advising the government, are considering evidence of loss of smell and taste closely.Professor Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, told The Daily  that, in the absence of adequate coronavirus testing, taste and smell loss could be a powerful means of identifying the otherwise asymptomatic super-spreaders - many of them young people - who endanger others.I think it\u0027s really important that we extend the criteria for which people self-isolate to include anybody with loss of taste and loss of sense of smell,” she said.“It’s critical that we identify patients who are asymptomatic to slow the spread of this disease.”Her comments follow a recommendation on Friday by Jerome Salomon, France’s top health official, that people experiencing anosmia contact their doctor, although Professor Hopkins said that, providing they were otherwise asymptomatic, people should simply self-isolate rather than contact the NHS.She said medical colleagues involved in the coronavirus response in Northern Italy had told her they believed around 50 per cent of doctors had temporarily lost their sense of taste or smell.“I’m aware that doctors on the front line in Italy, Iran and France are actively looking out for this as a sign of infection, she said.The symptoms have been seen in previous coronaviruses, but nearly always alongside the classic viral symptoms of coughing and high temperature.Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “If it really is an early feature then that would be really useful to know, but it can’t be on the basis of hearsay.”It came as a debate flared up among scientists over the extent to which diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal problems are common symptoms of Covid-19.A paper published this week in the American Journal of Gastroenterology found that approximately half of a sample of 204 patients admitted to hospital in Hubei province, China were suffering from these symptoms.However, Professor Hunter said this study was likely to be an outlier, and that most other research suggested that, at most, around 10 per cent of Covid-19 patients are affected.Coronavirus is hard to stop spreading because of the incubation period, the time between infection and the moment they start displaying symptoms.The government has been heavily criticised for the lack of testing, prompting Boris Johnson to announce last week that the number of daily tests would jump from 4,000 to 25,000.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/23/TELEMMGLPICT000228349348_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqlz5OdA_D3VmrC4drz6CMya9AwgQD4Npf3GkFJvgcOWM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"coronavirus qa view europe","story":"Nick Squires and Henry Samuel will be answering your questions on Europe\u0026#39s response to the coronavirus outbreakPandemics and epidemicsAs hospitals in France and Italy this weekend struggled with the numbers of patients being treated for the coronavirus spreading rapidly across Europe, their citizens were kept under strict lockdown conditions. People are only allowed out of their homes to collect essential supplies such as food and medicines, and face heavy fines for breaking the rules. With the situation in the UK believed to be only two weeks behind Italy, will looking at what is happening on the continent help us to understand what could be in store?   Our correspondents in Rome and Paris are here to answer your questions. Leave your questions in the comments section at the bottom of this article ahead of our next Q\u0026ampA. Alternatively, if you are reading this on the  app, or don’t have a  account, you can submit a question by emailing yourstory@telegraph.

The Italian still have supplies incl masks for the general public. Pharmacies and food shops still open? - Anon, via WhatsAppHenry Samuel writes: Crazy hoarding definitely happened in France early on and shops suddenly had no more pasta, rice, eggs and loo roll - like in the UK. The government issued appeals saying France was self-sufficient in terms of food and that no-one would go hungry.Supermarkets banned people buying more than a certain number of basic foodstuffs. It has now quietened down. Also, in Paris, bakers and grocers etc remain open, which definitely helped calm nerves.Nick Squires writes: Yes, I think all countries go through the same phases. Panic sets in to start with and people strip the supermarkets, but then a bit of common sense kicks in and governments assure people that there won’t be shortages. That is what we have seen here in Italy. I hope it will happen in the UK too.The image of Brits squirreling away a billion pounds’ worth of goods while NHS nurses went hungry was not very edifying. Hardly the keep-calm-and-carry-on image that the rest of the world has of the British.How will Covid-19 impact the Euro and the EU in the long term when all of this is over?  - Clive Norton, via WhatsAppNick Squires writes: Hi Clive, I think European solidarity has taken a big knock from the coronavirus crisis. Countries closing borders and canceling flights is anathema to the whole European project and to the Schengen principles in particular.Italy was furious earlier this month when Christine Lagarde, the governor of the European Central Bank, appeared to rule out measures to protect Rome from the effects of additional borrowing.Eurosceptics like Matteo Salvini have seized on all this to further their agendas, although they have been sidelined for now as the country swings behind the government at a time of national emergency.Conte, the prime minister, has the approval of 71 per cent of Italians for his handling of the crisis - his best ever score. On the other hand, Italy is going to need all the economic help it can get to weather this crisis.That will mean asking Brussels for the relaxing of spending rules. So having a decent relationship with the EU will count for a lot still. Will the EU be irreparably damaged by all this? Only time will tell. Henry Samuel writes: Hi Clive, It has clearly not been the EU’s finest hour. Dominique Reynié, head of the French foundation of political innovation, even predicted today in Le Figaro that the current crisis could prove “fatal to the European Union”.The EU’s lack of coordination on health matters and inability to produce, for example, ventilators and face masks, is a wake up call against offshoring such strategically vital products.  Nations have lacked solidarity: among the worst cases was the Czech Republic apparently pilfering Chinese masks and ventilators destined for Italy. China has done more to help Italy and other EU states than their immediate neighbours (and clearly hopes to gain political capital from its “magnanimity”).That said, there have been some heart-warming initiatives, such as offers from Germany and Switzerland to take on very sick French patients.It must be underlined that member states have always insisted they keep total control of their national health systems, so one could argue that EU institutions cannot be blamed for not coordinating these.But Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is said to be acutely aware of the risk of the EU being blamed for its inability to curtail this epidemic.My friends in Italy tell me that most of the fatalities are people aged over 75. Protecting the elderly as a first priority will likely keep the situation more manageable - Jon McKinley, via FacebookHenry Samuel writes: Hi Jon, It is undoubtedly true that the over 75s are the most at risk. They must be the priority. But the French authorities insist that between a third and a half of patients in intensive care with the virus are under 60. Most of those pull through, some don’t. It is a lottery how bad you get it, it seems. I know of people under 50 who have died so it is not to be taken lightly even if the statistics suggest the older you are, the higher the risks.Nick Squires writes: I concur with all of the above. The average age of the people dying in Italy is 80-82 and most had pre-existing health problems (around 75 per cent are men - scientists are not sure why that is). But there are also plenty of younger people contracting the virus and dying from it. What you can learn is that you MUST quarantine! The govt. needs to stop leaving it up to people to do the right thing. They won\u0027t. Most will but many won\u0027t and it is terrible. We here in Europe know just how bad it is going to get for you very soon if you don\u0027t. But it may already be too late. Be prepared people - Carolyn Byrne, via FacebookNick Squires writes: Hi Carolyn, I would second that. As an expert here in Italy said the other day, quarantine and containment are really the only weapons we have against coronavirus at the moment.That’s why the Italian government imposed an even more draconian regime yesterday, shutting down all but essential businesses and industry.And the rule is that we are not allowed to move from our municipality unless there is a pressing, urgent reason.Sadly, I think Britain will soon come to be familiar with rather similar measures. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, says he hopes we will see the beneficial effects of the lockdown in the next few days.There was a dip yesterday in the number of deaths, but the absolute numbers are still appallingly high - 793 on Saturday and 651 on Sunday.Henry Samuel: I agree, Carolyn. I could see it with my own UK-based family who took several days to take in the messages I was sending.France took time to come to terms with confinement and a week ago banned people from going out unless they carried a form explaining why they had a valid reason, such as to buy food, for essential health reasons, to buy food, to walk the dog or do exercise.Days later, people were still strolling along the banks of the Seine or the Promenade des anglais in Nice.The police have handed out hundreds of thousands of fines of €135 but as of yesterday, these can now rise drastically if you repeat the violation. Some towns have imposed curfews.The UK has been 3-4 weeks behind Italy for a long time, actually. As an Italian I was shocked when at first the British government suggested the strategy of herd immunity. Now you have slightly stricter measures put in place, but I\u0027m still puzzled. Good luck - Chris Bianco , via FacebookNick Squires writes: Hi Chris, Many Italians here would agree with you. There has been utter bewilderment that, until a few days ago at least, the UK government seemed not to realise the enormity of what it was facing.Many Italians feel that the British should take advantage of Italy’s experience and learn from it.These few lines are from a piece I wrote this morning, marking the two weeks since we have been under lockdown here in Italy.“I see your lot are making a mess of it,” Giuseppe, the man who sells me my newspapers each morning, cheerily remarked on Friday.“Boris obstinate and contrary – the shutdown must wait,” was the headline in that day’s Corriere della Sera newspaper. “Britain is continuing to follow its own path, in (splendid?) isolation,” the daily remarked.“What then is the strategy of the British government, which to the rest of Europe appears to be folly?” the paper asked.Henry Samuel writes: Hi Chris, We experienced the same time lag in France with people only a week ago taking to parks en masse and finding it hard to take the unfolding Italian tragedy seriously.A wake up call was when a large group of French correspondents in Italy sent a letter to Libération imploring the French to come to their senses. Sadly, it is typical human inertia.Today, I see that Le Monde is running article lamenting the “ten days lost by (Boris) Johnson”. The French government also lost valuable time, however.Isn\u0027t an even more draconian \u0027short, sharp, shock\u0027 solution going to be more effective right now than the clearly strong but ineffective approach being implemented on the continent?Surely the people would forgive several weeks of strictly enforced law with only military out on the street if it meant beating the threat of this deadly virus? - Peter WhiteheadHenry Samuel writes: Hi Peter, Hundreds of French doctors are in agreement with you and today released a petition in Le Parisien calling for “total lockdown” along the lines you suggest. However, France’s state council yesterday rejected this idea, notably pointing out that it could end up in people not getting proper access to food etc. “Western democracies will never go as far as China” is what some are saying. That said, it called for stricter rules on non-essential tasks out of the house, such as jogging etc.Also, we are told it is a little early to say how “ineffective” current confinement measures in France are proving because there is a lag of around two weeks between implementing them and a drop in deaths given the incubation period. Italy has been in confinement longer but it has proved difficult to enforce despite a curfew, which has only been implemented in a few French towns for now.I would also add that even a “short, sharp shock” will not knock this virus on the head. What authorities are doing is stemming its spread so as not to totally overwhelm the health system. The question remains how do we end confinement without seeing cases rocket again? Will countries have to wait until effective treatment is found or a vaccine? The latter is unlikely to be available until next year at the earliest.What\u0027s the 2 week prediction based on? Italy and the UK had their first confirmed case on the same day (Jan 31) and Italy implemented containment measures earlier. Also, 2 weeks ago Italy had 3x as many deaths - Skayze, via Twitter Nick Squires writes: Hi there. My esteemed colleague Paul Nuki, global health and security editor, explained it better than we could. He cites Inigo Martincorena, group leader at the Sanger Institute in Cambridge as warning that unless Britain was completely locked down by Monday, we would suffer the same fate or worse. “You can see how the UK epidemic is closely following Italy\u0027s, with a 14-15 day lag and the same doubling rate.

Now the charity, together with the University of Gloucestershire, is undertaking tests to establish the giant\u0027s age.Archaeologists have excavated small trenches to enable samples of soil to be extracted from points on the giant\u0027s elbows and feet.Over the coming weeks, Professor Phillip Toms, from the University of Gloucestershire, will attempt to date the samples using a technique called optically stimulated luminescence (OSL).Martin Papworth, a senior archaeologist at the National Trust, said: The OSL technique is commonly used to determine when mineral grains in the soil were last exposed to sunlight.It was used to discover the age of the Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire in the 1990s, which was found to be nearly 3,000-years-old - even more ancient than we had expected.We\u0027re expecting the results of the tests in July. It is likely that the tests will give us a date range, rather than a specific age, but we hope they will help us better understand, and care for, this famous landmark.Gordon Bishop, chairman of the Cerne Historical Society, said villagers were eagerly awaiting the results.Although there are some who would prefer the giant\u0027s age and origins to remain a mystery, I think the majority would like to know at least whether he is ancient or no more than a few hundred-years-old, he said.Whichever may be the case, he is unique.In separate analysis, environmental archaeologist Mike Allen will analyse soil samples containing the microscopic shells of land snails to learn more about the site\u0027s past.There are 118 species of snails in Britain and many of them are habitat specific, so their preserved shells can help us establish what a landscape was like at a certain time, and to track changes in land use over time, he said.They should help us to discover whether the giant was created on a grazed chalk hillside, or whether people purposely cleared scrub to prepare the land for the figure.Most of the time, the giant chalk figure is fairly low maintenance with  sheep grazing the site in spring and autumn to keep him trim, but it is seeds deposited in the sheeps’ poo that encourages weed growth within his lines. The weeds are sprayed by chief ranger Michael Clarke and his team but there comes a point where the top layer of chalk has to be replaced.Last year, the giant was refreshed for the first time in 11 years.

This includes buses, trams, commuter trains and national rail services.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, has asked rail companies to keep as many services running as possible to provide space for passengers to comply with social distancing requirements, suggesting the Government is not expecting people to stop travelling entirely.Walking outside is safer, but avoid touching railings, buttons at pedestrian crossings etc. If this is unavoidable, wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.There are no restrictions on travelling by car or bike or any other form of personal transport. However, people may want to reconsider car pooling or travelling with multiple passengers. The Government has advised Britons against travelling out of the UK for the next 30 days unless absolutely essential.Everyone should now be working from home unless it is not feasible to do so. For example, goods drivers, delivery and transport workers and those working in the emergency services will still need to carry on their jobs. Face-to-face meetings should be replaced with video calls.Pubs and restaurants have been told to close but the risk from other businesses is likely to be low if they are quiet and if healthy people keep a safe distance and practise good hygiene. The same is likely to apply to visiting the hairdresser, but cutting down on social mixing will undoubtedly prevent spread, so keeping grooming appointments and social excursions to a minimum is essential. Some experts have suggested swapping an afternoon at the pub for a walk outside or a quiet picnic as the weather warms. The Prime Minister has said mass gatherings would no longer be supported by emergency workers.Takeaway food should be a safe option, particularly if delivered, as long as restaurants practise good hygiene. Visiting shops for anything other than essential items is best avoided in the near future.The Church of England has announced that public worship is suspended until further notice. However, church buildings will remain open for prayer where practical and as long as worshippers observe social distancing recommendations.Gyms are among the businesses ordered to keep shut, but keeping fit and healthy is essential during a health crisis, so people should still try to get out and about but stay away from crowded areas. A walk on the beach, a run in the park or a stroll through the countryside is preferable to a city centre, but keeping apart from other people is the main goal.Older people, especially, are advised to make sure they still get fresh air, perhaps by getting into the garden. However, Boris Johnson warned on Sunday that Britain faced a total lockdown within 24 hours amid growing concern at the failure of the public to heed demands for “social distancing” to prevent the coronavirus spreading as huge numbers of people headed to parks or shopping areas and mingled closely.He said the UK could follow France, Italy and Spain where people’s movements have been restricted by police, curfews have been imposed, parks closed and all stores except food shops and pharmacies shut.People should avoid visiting the shops, even to get essentials, if they or a member of their household displays symptoms of coronavirus.The official government advice states: Keep your windows open to let in fresh air, get some natural sunlight if you can, or get outside into the garden. You can also go for a walk or exercise outdoors if you stay more than 2 metres from others.It is important to take extra care when out and about, regarding every surface as being contaminated and avoiding touching gates, fences and railings. Even if you feel healthy, you may be infected so clean your hands regularly to avoid infecting others. If you meet people when out and about, try to keep a distance of two metres.Older people should try to remain active and strong, as six out of 10 falls happen at home. Health experts are recommending that people carry out strength-building exercises if they are unable or unwilling to leave the house.Professor Sir Muir Gray, an expert in healthy ageing at Oxford University said: Being active can have a significant impact on preventing dementia and frailty. Many exercise studios and gyms have started releasing online classes so people can stay active while socially distancing.The new guidance suggests avoiding gatherings with friends and family and instead contacting people by phone, or on the internet or social media. Older people have been advised to avoid Sunday lunch with their children and grandchildren until further notice. However the guidelines say social distancing should be done as much as is pragmatic and for a host of regions it may not be sensible or practicable to avoid contact with others. People providing essential care for others, such as helping with washing, dressing or preparing meals, should carry on as usual but take extra care with hygiene. Greater care should be taken to avoid visiting the over-70s and those with health conditions, but popping in to see a healthy friend or relative is unlikely to cause the virus to spread if both are practising good hand-washing. If you do visit friends or relatives, avoid physical contact with others in social situations, including handshakes, hugs and kisses.Older people in care homes should try to avoid visitors as much as possible until the spread begins to die down.The chief medical officer for Scotland, Dr Catherine Calderwood, has suggested that older people should reduce their social contact by 75 per cent rather than shunning visitors completely. Many people will have dental or doctor\u0027s appointments in the coming weeks, and the Government is asking people to talk to their GP or clinician to discuss whether to come in or postpone them. Visiting a GPs surgery should pose no problems for people showing no symptoms of coronavirus, but it is better to seek advice online in the first instance and Boris Jounson has said people should avoid unnecessary visits to the NHS. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: If you have chronic lymphatic leukaemia and have to go to hospital once a month for treatment and you stopped going, your leukaemia would worsen and your life would be shortened. But there are lots of other routine visits that aren\u0027t as important, so you have to balance the risk. I think a lot of these will be cancelled anyway when we move to the main peak of the outbreak.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"italy life like two weeks ago do not make mistakes did","story":"As we watch the coronavirus crisis unfold in Britain, there is a deep sense of déjà vu here in Italy.Two weeks ago, we were at exactly the same point that you are today.The day before, the Sunday, millions of Italians had taken advantage of sparkling spring weather to go out for the day – just as happened in the UK on Sunday.There was a feeling here that the situation was not too serious and in any case the health crisis was confined to Lombardy and surrounding areas, far to the north.My family and I blithely headed to a beach outside Rome for lunch with friends. It was packed.We had to call three restaurants before we could get a booking. Hundreds of people strolled along the sand, throwing sticks to dogs and playing with their kids – just as happened on Sunday in the UK.The next day, the Italian government scolded us all like naughty children. Ministers were furious. The sight of people crowding together and having lunch in groups was shameful and irresponsible, they said. People were just not understanding the gravity of the situation.Again, the parallels with Britain are uncanny. The government is angry that people failed to heed the call to avoid crowds and maintain social distancing, instead flocking to parks, gardens and the seaside.If our experience in Italy is anything to go by, a total lockdown in the UK is now all but inevitable.When it happened here, it came less than 24 hours after we were enjoying spaghetti alle vongole and chilled white wine at the beach near Rome.Since then, things have ratcheted up further.Police have conducted more than a million spot checks, making sure people have a valid reason to be out of their homes.The army has been deployed to Lombardy, the worst-hit region. In the city of Bergamo, the local cemetery was so overflowing with the dead that coffins had to be piled into military trucks and transported to other cities.Friends venturing out for a run have been berated by passers-by, who have told them they should be at home.After the lockdown was imposed, fleeing to a second home or country retreat was expressly forbidden.If you left the city in time, you were lucky if not, you were stuck.Shopping is allowed but it is a taut, nerve-wracking experience – all the staff, and most of the customers, wear face masks. No one lingers or chats. I found myself holding my breath as people passed close to me in the supermarket. The objective is to get in and get out as quickly as possible.Restaurants and bars were closed down. A decree announced by the government on Sunday means that we are not allowed to leave the municipality we find ourselves in.Until a couple of days ago, when the British government started to take the situation more seriously, Italians were baffled that the UK was not following the Italian model of preventative measures.“I see your lot are making a mess of it,” Giuseppe, the man who sells me my newspapers each morning, cheerily remarked on Friday.“Boris obstinate and contrary – the shutdown must wait,” was the headline in that day’s Corriere della Sera newspaper. “Britain is continuing to follow its own path, in (splendid?) isolation,” the daily remarked.“What then is the strategy of the British government, which to the rest of Europe appears to be folly?” the paper asked.While an Italy-style lockdown in Britain seems inevitable, let’s hope the UK does not follow Italy on the trajectory of deaths and infections.The situation here is grim in the extreme. There is a feeling that the contagion is out of control.On Saturday alone, 793 people died. On Sunday another 651 died, bringing the total death toll in Italy to nearly 5,500. There have been nearly 60,000 infections.It is just two weeks since Italy was put under lockdown, but it feels much longer.

The Kremlin said that everyone who takes part in meetings with the president is asked to test for coronavirus.Moscow, where more than half of Russia’s 438 coronavirus cases were recorded, has closed down theatres, cinemas and gyms but has stopped short of announcing a complete lockdown.The relatively low number of cases for the nation of 145 million is mostly explained by narrow testing as well as early restrictions that the government took in February by shutting down the border with China and barring Chinese nationals from the country.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 23rd march 2020","story":"A combination picture shows residents toasting during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours during the coronavirus lockdown imposed by the Belgian government in an attempt to slow down the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in the Brussels commune of Anderlecht, BelgiumParents struggle with homeschooling as they complain \u0026#39maths has changed\u0026#39 on first day of closuresCoronavirus Q\u0026ampA: What can we learn from Europe?Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson set to order closure of all ‘non-essential’ shops Comment: Rail franchises had their day long before the coronavirus crisisLondon\u0026#39s Excel Centre considered as field hospital to help coronavirus outbreak Coronavirus deaths rising faster in UK than ItalyCoronavirus testing: how many people are being tested in the UK - and how does it compare to other countries? London lockdown: Are shops closed, is the Tube running and can I leave the house? Comment: Let\u0026#39s believe in Britain and lead the world in the fight against coronavirusWho is on the list of key workers?

The estate agent said it had apologised “unreservedly” to the tenant and offered them compensation.“We are taking the Covid-19 outbreak extremely seriously and we have reiterated to our staff that whatever the situation, anyone’s self-isolation should not be interrupted,” Foxtons said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If they answer yes to any of these, then the agent shouldn’t conduct the viewing.Property inspections should be postponed unless they are absolutely necessary, Mr Cox said. If the work is vital, then they should ask tenants if they have had any symptoms or contact with someone who has symptoms.

We’re monitoring those changes carefully to make sure we can respond rapidly if needed.”There have so far been more than 340,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world, resulting in close to 15,000 deaths.The sharpest rise in cases in recent days has been in the US, which overtook Spain, Germany, Iran, France and South Korea over the last week to be the third worst affected country behind China and Italy.More than 100 million Americans have been ordered to stay at home, with eight states currently under lockdown.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It looks outwardly near-identical to the current model, but it offers better value, increased storage and faster performance. But even these things are not the game-changer: that’s the new keyboard.The pricing first: where the previous MacBook Air, on sale until just days ago, cost £1,099 and came with 128GB of internal storage, the entry-level Air is now £100 less, £999, and has 256GB of storage. There’s also a 512GB model available, with a faster processor, for £1,299. There are still lots of laptops out there for much less money, but this price represents good value. Note that Apple has education pricing for those in class as students or teachers, so it’s possible to get that price even lower if you qualify.The look is the same as before: sleek and classy. It comes in three colours, silver, space grey and gold. The space grey is the best: solid and businesslike without looking boring, though the gold, warm with a peachy hint to it, is also a head-turner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe build quality of the MacBook Air is exceptional, an all-aluminium casing that’s sculpted to the slimmest of edges to make it easy to pick up. Like all MacBooks, and unlike many other laptops, you can open it with one hand, the build is so perfectly balanced. Other machines require a finger to hold down the keyboard as you open the lid or the whole thing swings up as it opens.This MacBook Air continues to have a power button with Touch ID built in – a fingerprint scanner that ensures your computer screen locks when you’re away from it and only unlocks to your finger. Apple Watch wearers can also use their smart timepiece to unlock the MacBook Air, which is cool. Both mechanisms feel intimate and secure.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The Air has two Thunderbolt USB-C ports. For other connections, such as USB-A, you’ll need an adaptor. That’s not always convenient, though it gets easier all the time as more accessories switch to USB-C, and it helps to keep the Air thin.The MacBook Air has been preposterously slim and light since it was first unveiled by Steve Jobs in 2008 when the then-CEO slid it out of an envelope to an admiring crowd. It was so much thinner and lighter than the competition that it drew gasps of excitement. Over the next decade it slipped behind, especially in terms of the screen resolution, though that’s been fixed. Now, the 13in display is bright, rich and superbly high-resolution.Apple releases iPad with 3D scanner and a trackpadApple and Netflix pull out of SXSW over coronavirus fearsAnd then there’s the new keyboard. Apple keyboards were traditionally outstanding, using a scissor-switch mechanism, with lots of travel and a great feel. Then, a few years ago, Apple changed to a whole new system, using a butterfly mechanism. The first-generation of this was quite noisy, but this was overcome in subsequent versions. But then, problems arose which led to keyboards being replaced as users complained that there wasn’t the same reliability.Last year, on the MacBook Pro 16in, Apple introduced the Magic Keyboard – a name taken from its desktop wireless keyboard – which changed everything. The new keys were quieter, more stable and had more travel – a full 1mm. That’s not quite as much as the keys moved before the butterfly landed, when it was 1.2mm. But it was enough, and it was a revelation.It’s the same here. Using the new keyboard subtly transforms the typing experience. It’s not that the butterfly keys were bad: unless they failed, they worked well and were comfortable to use.But as soon as you use the new Magic Keyboard, you recognise how comfortable and inviting it is. The downside is it’s quite hard to go back. Having typed this review on the MacBook Air keys, I picked up a previous Air to make a comparison. As soon as I started typing, my fingers told me I was missing the new experience. The keys on the old Air, which I had used happily before, just couldn’t match the luxurious and satisfying feel of the new one. The gentle scoop on the top of each key that helps your fingers find the right place to touch, the crisper inidual backlighting to make typing in a less bright room a breeze and the clearer lettering on each key – all of which are small, subtle improvements that Apple has made with the Magic Keyboard – add up to something big.The processor has been improved on the latest models with a 1.1GHz dual-core Core i3 processor on the £999 model and a 1.1GHz quad-core Core i5 chip on the £1,299 version.In practical terms, this means that the Air is a real performer. Not that it was a slouch before, but it handles tasks easily. It’s true, the MacBook Pro is still the go-to laptop for those doing advanced video processing or running other power-hungry programs. But the Air is now very fast and effective. To the extent that many customers may ask whether they really need to spend £1,299 on the entry-level 13in MacBook Pro rather than a £999 MacBook Air that isn’t that far off. Sure, there are other extras in the Pro range, like the spiffy Touch Bar instead of function keys, and four Thunderbolt USB-C sockets instead of two on the Air, for instance.Battery life on the MacBook Air is exemplary: it just goes on and on all day where other laptops, including some MacBook Pro models, don’t last as long. It’s so good that you may not even think about checking how much charge is left in the battery. It gives a great feeling of peace of mind.The new MacBook Air is available for order now, with deliveries starting next week. It represents a big step forward for the super-slim Apple laptop, combining sumptuous good looks with real performance and, above all, an unbeatably appealing keyboard.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These iniduals will not have a right to live in Britain after the deadline of June 2021, unless they successfully appeal the decision.The number remains proportionately small, as there have been nearly 3 million applications processed overall, but it marks a considerable jump from the previous monthly figures, when just seven people had been refused.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt that point the refusals were all on the grounds of criminality, but most of the latest refusals were due to issues around eligibility –\u0026nbspusually because the applicant has been unable to provide the relevant\u0026nbspdocumentary\u0026nbspevidence.While the number is still proportionately low, campaigners have raised alarm at the sudden increase, and it is likely to prompt concern around difficulties more vulnerable people face when obtaining evidence.Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesEU settlement scheme delays leave people unable to get jobsNine out of 10 EU settlement scheme appeals successful, data showsWithout physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe Home Office said officials had made every attempt to obtain the necessary evidence before refusing applications, and that decisions to refuse were not taken lightly and signed off at a high level.Maike Bohn, co-founder of campaign group\u0026nbspthe3million, told The Independent she was concerned by the fact that while there had been no refusals on eligibility grounds before February 2020, there was now a sharp rise.“This is hard to explain. We urgently need more explanation from the Home Office as to why those cases have been refused,” she said. “It is concerning that as soon as the UK left the EU we see people being refused settled status.”Christopher Desira, immigration solicitor at Seraphus law firm, said there were likely to be more and more refusals beyond criminality grounds, which may worry a lot of people in uncommon family arrangements, which tend to be the most complex applications.\u0026nbspHe also raised alarm over the gaps in free outreach and advice services that are likely to form due to the coronavirus outbreak, which may cause problems for those receiving requests for further information from the Home Office, but not know how to respond, and called on the Home Office to pause any refusals until the emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are our families and friends, our colleagues and carers. They must have the right to stay.\u0026nbspEven before the coronavirus crisis, we were warning that tens of thousands of EU citizens will be left without settled status when the Conservative government’s arbitrary deadline hits next year.“That would leave thousands of people effectively undocumented and at risk of eviction, detention and even deportation. It will be a new Windrush scandal on an even bigger scale.”The Home Office figures show that overall, there have been more than 3.34 million applications to the scheme up to the end of February 2020.Minister for future borders and immigration Kevin Foster said: “EU citizens have made huge contributions to our country.

in a bid to stop the death toll reaching ,.The Government guidance is that people who are over , have an underlying health condition or are pregnant, are strongly advised to limit social interaction with friends and family, where possible.It is thought to apply to around  million people, including adults under  who qualy for a flu jab due to an underlying health condition and people with chronic long-term respiratory diseases, such as asthma.A further . million people - those with a suppressed immune system, eg. chemo patients - are advised to self-isolate for  weeks, to shield themselves from the bug.Here, we take you through the people who should self-isolate for  weeks - as the coronavirus epidemic spirals...The elderly set to be hit the hardest by the coronavirus pandemic because their immune systems are weaker - meaning their bodies are less able to fight Covid-.Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and Clinical Director of Patient Access, told The Sun: We know that as you get older, your immune system becomes less efficient – that’s why older people are at higher risk of serious complications of coronavirus infection.If your immune system isn’t strong, it’s more likely that the virus can multiply deep inside your lung, causing inflammation and scarring.Your immune system will try and fight it off, and will often destroy healthy lung tissue in the process.This makes you more prone to get ‘secondary’ infections like pneumococcal pneumonia.Pensioners will have to remain in their homes, except for getting medical care, and not go to work, school or public areas.Experts also say people who are self-isolating need to separate themselves from other people in their home and stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened.If they do not have access to the internet or are not handy with a computer, Age UK recommend that healthy, more active people help with running errands like picking up bits of shopping.The Government is in talks with major retailers to ensure the elderly and vulnerable can still get access to supplies, such as through a telephone hotline where they can place orders.It may be worth ensuring that the older people in your le are set up with online shopping accounts now, are able to access social media to stay in touch with other or have been introduced to streaming services such as Netflix.On top of this, part of the mental battle of isolation is remaining as active as possible - eventhis means standing up ten times in one hour and walking between rooms in the house.If the elderly person you are helping has a garden, encourage them to walk around it - and make sure they are not immobile for long periods of time, watching television for long periods or remaining bed bound.Anyone who visits an older person should wash their hands before and after they visit.Ensure carers in homes or those doing regular home visits do not attendthey are sick or displaying symptoms of coronavirus.The UK government has now classed expectant mothers as those among the vulnerable group of society at risk of Covid-.Professor Chris Whitty, Englands Chief Medical Officer, said that including pregnant women in this group was a precautionary measure as experts are early in our understanding of this virus.And his deputy, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, said its hoped that these new measures will reduce the infection rate and protect those at higher risk.He told the BBC: When it comes to this coronavirus, it is a new disease, its been with humans around the world for just a few months.We are being very precautionary in terms of the advice we are giving to pregnant women to increase their social distancing.We know that a whole range of normal infections are more serious in pregnancy and the advice were giving is extremely precautionary.This way the baby can be monitored using continuous electronic fetal monitoring, and the mums oxygen levels can be monitored hourly.As this can only take place in an obstetric unit, where doctors and midwives are present, it is not currently recommended that you give birth at home or in a midwe led unit, where only midwes would be present.The experts also say that there is no evidence to suggest that you cannot give birth vaginally - or that youd be safer having a c-section.Therefore your birth plan should be followed as closely as possible based on your wishes.However,your respiratory condition suggested that urgent delivery would be needed, a caesarean birth may be recommended.The experts added: There is no evidence that women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cannot have an epidural or a spinal block.However, the use of gas and air may increase aerosolisation and spread of the virus, so your maternity team will discuss all the options with you in early labour to ensure you are aware of the pain relief options available to you.He added: The early signal, and it is only an early signal, is that the highest risk is only going to be towards the end of the third trimester, so from the th week, that kind of position in the pregnancy.But we are being very precautionary and saying that because we dont know enough about this disease yet.We havent got enough information on the disease in pregnant women, that the best thing to do is take a precautionary approach and advise social distancing and to identy that this is strongly advised for pregnant women as a whole group.According to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , the large majority of women will experience only mild or moderate symptoms.These include a cough, fever and shortness of breath.People with severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis will have to self-isolate for  weeks.This includes people with severe asthma who require hospital admissions or courses of steroid tablets.This is because people with chest conditions are generally more likely to pick up infections, and are more vulnerable to complicationsthey do develop an infection such as coronavirus.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Professor Kevin Southern, from the UKs Cystic Fibrosis Trust Medical Association, said: It is important to continue to pursue a fit and healthy lestyle and to be up to date with immunisations, including ‘flu’, even though this is a dferent virus.If a person with CF develops cold or ‘flu-like symptoms , speak with your CF team about starting a recommended back-up antibiotic treatment.People with cancer are among those at higher risk of complications from Covid- - because cancer and treatment can weaken their immune systems.The immune system protects the body against illness and infection caused by viruses like coronavirus.Some people with cancer have a weak immune system which reduces their ability to fight these infections.This is because some treatments, like chemotherapy, can stop the bone marrow from making enough white blood cells, which are part of your immune system.This is most likely to happen during a course of cancer treatment, but the effects can last for some time afterwards.Some types of cancer can also lower your ability to fight infection. This is usually cancer that affects your immune system like leukaemia or lymphoma.When your ability to fight infection is lowered the symptoms of any infection can be much more severe and may become dangerous.Cancer Research UK urge those with the disease to talk to your cancer team and follow NHS advice.Primary immunodeficiencies are disorders in which part of the bodys immune system is missing or does notnormally.This leaves them with reduced or no natural defence against germs such as bacteria, fungi and viruses - and that is likely to be true with Covid-.Susan Walsh from the PID UK said they were advising people to follow Public Health England guidelines.She told : We are also telling people thatthey do feel ill they should contact a doctor promptly with details of their diagnosis, medication and immunology centre.It’s a balance between raising awareness, but not creating great fear. It needs to be handled very carefully.Someone with a severe disease of a body system is more likely to have a less robust immune system - meaning their bodys response is not as strong a response when exposed to viruses.In particular, based on early reports,  per cent of hospitalised Covid- patients had cardiovascular disease.The bugs main target is the lungs but that could affect the heart, especially a diseased heart, which has to work harder to get oxygenated blood throughout the body.That could exacerbate problems for someone with heart failure, where the heart is already having problems pumping efficiently.Similarly, those with severe kidney diseaseshould also be particularly cautious and self-isolate.Kidney Care UK says those having dialysis will still get dialysis sessions they just may be asked to come in at a dferent time and some people may be asked to do two sessions a week rather than three, provided it is considered to be safe for you do so.Public Health England say those with clinical conditions that put them at a high risk of severe illness from Covid- will be contacted by NHS England next week.They will be told the stringent measures they need to take in order to keep themselves and others safe.For now, they should rigorously follow the social distancing advice from the government in full.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but these are usually mild and begin gradually.And more recently, The British Association of Otorhinolaryngologysaid loss of smell or taste could also be a sign that you have contracted coronavirus.Despite this, developing these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have the illness and they are similar to other illnesses, such as the common cold or flu.Some people will not develop all of these symptoms -  and some might not even show symptoms at all, experts say.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UKs chief scientic adviser, said: It looks quite likely that there is some degree of asymptomatic transmission.There’s definitely quite a lot of transmission very early in the disease when there are very mild symptoms.Around one out of every six who gets Covid- become seriously ill and develops dficulty breathing, according to the WHO.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are at most risk developing serious illness.This can include pneumonia and swelling in the lungs, which can make it hard for the lungs to pass oxygen into the bloodstream - leading to organ failure and death.Severe pneumonia can kill people by causing them to drown in the fluid flooding their lungs.People with fever, cough and dficulty breathing should seek medical attention, the WHO says.If youre in doubt whether you have coronavirus you can visit the Patient Access clinically approved coronavirus checking tool here.Symptoms are thought to appear between two and  days.New research has found that the average incubation period of Covid- is . days.A study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US found that almost allof those who develop symptoms appeared to do so within . days of infection.Experts say there is little evidence to suggest that people can spread the virus without showing symptoms.The best way to prevent catching any form of coronavirus is to practice good hygiene, health experts say.Health bosses say the best way to protect yourself and others is to wash your hands with soap and water for the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.Happy Birthday takes about  seconds to sing twice and is said to be the perfect number to clean your hands to thoroughly.If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitiser that contains at least  per cent alcohol.Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.If Covid- is spreading in your community, take extra measures to put distance between yourself and other people - especially those who are more vulnerable - to further reduce your risk of being exposed to this new virus.Stay at home as much as possible and consider ways of getting food brought to your house through family, social, or commercial networks.According to a  study in the American Journal of Infection Control, people touch their faces more than  times an hour on average.However, youll need to try your best not to do thisyou want to protect yourself from coronavirus.This is because were constantly touching surfaces contaminated with pathogens such as doorknobs, phones and handrails.These pathogens can be picked up by our hands and get into the body through mucous membranes on the face — eyes, nose, and mouth — that act as pathways to the throat and lungs.Also, make sure to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.Throw used tissues in the bin straight away.Its hard to know when someone is going to cough or sneeze, butyou can, try and avoid standing within two metres of them.Droplets from a cough or sneeze can travel up to approximately ftwhen expelled through the air.Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily.This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, counter tops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is a time for unity and for respecting others, especially the most vulnerable.As the Queen put it yesterday in her admirable statement: “I am reminded that our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.”As the emergency deepens, abuse of privilege should play no part in our national response.But that is exactly what is now happening, as is graphically demonstrated by the saga of private Covid- tests kits.One of the biggest problems the Government faces is the shortage of capacity for testing.To prevent the current system from being overwhelmed by demand, NHS policy is only to test people with a “high chance” of having the illness, such as those who have ed from high-risk countries or are displaying symptoms.Even doctors and nurses working in the front-line are not routinely tested.But to evade such official restrictions, a growing number of the rich and famous are forking out for private coronavirus kits, which can cost anything between £ and £.According to one report this week, more than , wealthy figures in Britain have ordered such kits.Dr Mark Ali, director of the Harley Street clinic, said: “We have private iniduals – some recognisable names there – and we are testing lords and ladies and even doctors and dentists who are worried about catching the disease.”It is the same story of privileged access in the US, where, just as in Britain, shortages of supplies mean that many health care workers and sick people are unable to get diagnoses.But some stars seek to bypass rules that limit tests to those most at risk.A huge controversy erupted this week at the news that eight top NBA basketball teams has been tested, making a mockery of the rationing.Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, spoke for much of the public when he said that “an entire NBA team should not get tested for Covid- while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealth, but for the sick.”On both sides of the Atlantic, this two-tiered approach is wrong on so many levels.It is a deep insult to healthcare workers. It is profoundly isive.And it does not lessen the burdens on the NHS here in Britain, as some apologists pretend.Those who test positive will still have to be treated in the health service, since the British private medical sector does not have the resources for this crisis.Selfish and irresponsible, the Covid-test queue jumpers are the equivalents of the supermarket stockpilers or the social distancing refuseniks who still insist on going down to the pub.During the Second World War, when the Blitz spirit was at its peak, there was fierce hostility to rich iniduals who tried to cheat on rationing regulations or avoid national service.The same contempt should now be shown to those who try to dodge the rules that promote fairness.But it is not just in testing where the narrow self-centredness of the rich can be found. They use their wealth to insulate themselves in other ways.Some are buying special private medical care, like intravenous infusions of vitamins and minerals to boost their immune system.Lansherhof, a private medical facility at the London Arts Club, reported this week an  per cent increase in enquires for its Immune Plus Support Infusion, which costs £.The rich are also using private jet travel to avoid the rest of the public as they conduct business or fly to remote havens.Inquiries for international flights by private jets are estimated to be up nine-fold since the outbreak began, while Hong Kong International Airport reported this week its busiest day for private jet activity.Nor do the rich have to endure the normal airport ordeal suffered by other passengers.A spokeswoman for Quintessentially, a concierge company for millionaires, said: “Members who are travelling commercially are choosing to book elite services at airports, not your typical first-class lounge.For example, private terminals where guests are greeted and given their own suite.Check-in, customs and security are all done privately and guests are taken to the doors of the aircraft.Members can request for the jetty to be cleared so they minimise the interactions with other passengers”.Most Brits have no choice over where they live in the midst of this crisis.But that is not true of the wealthy who can find sanctuary in one of their many properties or rent out an expensive rural bolt-hole.Some are now paying £,-a-month for a luxury base in the Cotswolds.Nor does self-isolation have to be the imprisoning experience that it is for ordinary citizens.The rich can bring in private chefs for their dinners, or expensive tutors for their children.The company Tutors International, which provides elite tuition services, says it has seen “a massive upswing in requests” since the outbreak began.The elite even have luxury face masks. The fashionable Airinum Urban Air Mask costs £ and claims to protect “against airborne particles as small as .mm.”But in this rarefied world, problems are faced by the elite that would never be considered by others.Wailing that she now has now chance to show off her expensive jewellery, one female financier in London says: “I’m just not sure when my next ball will be.”The experience of the affluent is in dramatic contrast to the misery faced by people at the other end of the scale.While the rich cocoon themselves, it is the wage-earners, the straitened households, the poor and the unemployed who are now in the eye of the storm.Our society is just beginning to realize the terrying consequences of this disaster, where the mounting death toll is matched by economic meltdown.Vast numbers of people – from hotel cleaners to airline cabin crew, from bar staff to retail assistants – are going to lose their jobs.The ranks of the five million self-employed will be decimated. Small businesses across the country will collapse.Food banks are already running short of supplies, while the plight of the homeless – who cannot isolate themselves on the streets – is desperate as shelters close.At worst, our prosperous civilisation could slide into a kind of modern feudal structure, with only the aristocracy at the top enjoying a decent standard of living.At a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Trump was asked whether “the well-connected go to the front of the line”.He replied philosophically: “You’d have to ask them that. Perhaps that’s been the story of le.”But it should not be that way, especially when mankind is facing one of its darkest hours.We should all be in this together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Burnham said Downing Street needed to make its message much simpler to stop people taking to the streets.It came after a weekend which saw people flood to outdoor areas and gather in groups - despite clear advice that doing exactly that would spread the coronavirus and cause more preventable deaths.Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Mr Burnham the PMaposs messages are clearly not working. He added: Just look at the scenes around the country at the weekend. And look I donapost blame the public, I think the messaging is mixed. We had the Prime Minister in Downing Street saying it was okay to get out and about - speaking next to a podium that said aposStay At Home. He was then saying stay two metres apart in a packed room in  Downing Street. So the messages are completely mixed. We need to move today to a aposstay at homeapos policy, that was the message coming from NHS staff at the weekend. This morning Ministers said they are examining the curfews and restrictions imposed in Europe as a method of controlling the spread of coronavirus.  He said the unpleasant and very dficult times meant that it was possible the authorities, including the police, could be required to order people to follow the rules on social distancing. And he said that nothing is off the tablefurther curbs on peopleaposs freedoms were required to slow the progress of Covid- through the UK.Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared shocked at the prospect of the police being brought in to enforce coronavirus restrictions when asked about it at a press conference on Sunday.But Mr Hancock said officers had already been given the powers to force the closure of bars and restaurants and indicated that other restrictions would be considered.

The government should “do more in the pursuit of suppressing the epidemic whether through enforced lockdowns or enforced social distancing rather than voluntary measures”, they add. The team of clinicians, statisticians and epidemiologists says the UK measures do not go far enough. The number of deaths is estimated using NHS health records from .m adults in England. Dr Amitava Banerjee of UCL, the lead author, told the FT: “The UK government is currently following a partial suppression policy of population-wide social distancing, combined with home isolation of cases, as well as school and university closures, but this is currently not [mandatory].

Mr Johnson warned Brits could soon face the tougher measures adopted in other European countries like Italy and Francepeople did not behave responsibly. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. Mr Johnson has faced criticism for not acting faster to slow the spread of the virus. He also raised questions when he appeared to contradict himself by telling Brits not to visit their mums on Motheraposs Day while saying he hoped to see his own mum. He later said he would be calling her. The government has already shut down pubs, clubs and restaurants across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But authorities were dismayed by the scenes over the weekend as pictures and footage flooded in from around the country.  Huge lines crowded to climb the Snowdon peak in Wales, and in London, large groups and cyclists packed out popular parks. Several local authorities, including Hammersmith and Fulham Council, took the step of closing all their parks in response to the crowds. And the Royal Parks issued a warning that while its parks remain open for now, it could be forced to close them, as it announced it was shutting all remaining take-away cafes and kiosks: with immediate effect as people are not adhering to social distancing guidelines. Mr Johnson said Government had always followed the scientic advice when it came to access to open spaces - but warned people needed to observe the guidance that they should not gather in groups and remain two metres apart. What they have always said so far is that the health benefits for the whole of society of keeping the parks and playgrounds openwe possibly can outweigh the epidemiological value of closing them, he said.  But of course looking at the way people behave and the way they are responding, we keep that under constant, constant review. If people canapost make use of parks and playgrounds responsibly,they canapost do it in a way that observes the two-metre rule then of course we are going to have to look at further measures. The general principle should be that we should all as far as we possibly can stay home, protect our NHS and thereby save lives. He added: I donapost think you need to use your imagination very much to see where we might have to go, and we will think about this very very actively in the next  hours. The Government later issued updated guidance on essential travel, saying it did not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays. Earlier, in a message to the nation, the Prime Minister warned Britain was only two or three weeks behind Italy where the death toll has already risen above , making it the worst outbreak anywhere in the world. In the UK, the death toll stands at , with , confirmed cases.  However experts have warned the number of cases is likely much higher, as many Brits and NHS staff say not everyone with Covid- symptoms is being tested. He said that unless the UK could control the spread of the virus through social distancing, the NHS would be overwhelmed in the same way that the Italian healthcare system had been. However the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, cautioned against comparing the UKaposs figures too closely with other countriesapos. As you go through a sharp rise in numbers, which we will see going forward, you have to be careful to be comparing too precisely, she said.  We will look back in due course, sadly, and see the true number of people who have died from coronavirus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has since warned the Government may have to take further actionpeople continue to flout social distancing rules of staying two metres away from each other. He told Sky News: This is not the sort of thing that anybody would want to do but, of course, it is the sort of thing we might have to do in order to protect le. If you do go out, you must not get closer than two metres from someone who isnapost in your household.It is a really simple rule and incredibly important, because to protect le and the NHS we need to stop the spread of this virus and the virus spreads by people coming into close contact with each other.  Elsewhere other political figures adopted a notably more strident tone than the Prime Minister as they warned people not to leave their homes other than for essential business. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, whose city is at the centre of the epidemic in Britain, has ordered the city to stay off its public transport networks, including the London Underground, unless it is for essential travel. Mr Khan said people must obey the guidance or others would die. This isnapost advice, as far as Iaposm concerned. These are instructions and these are rules that we should all obey to stop people dying, he told BBCaposs The Andrew Marr Show. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced she was closing the ferries to the Scottish islands to all non-essential travellers after the military was brought in to transport a patient to the mainland. She said people should not go shopping except for essentials like food and medicine and she condemned people flocking to Scotlandaposs remote communities for adding to the pressure on local health services. Beaches should not be busy, parks should not be full, she said.

The allegations, shared widely online, feed into claims that the focus on the public developing so-called “herd immunity” meant the Government was too slow to react. No  has always denied this was their strategy, although it was mentioned by Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance, insisting they were always planning tougher measures when the timing was right. The newspaper claimed that at a private event at the end of February, Mr Cummings outlined the Government’s strategy, which those present claimed was “herd immunity, protect the economy andthat means some pensioners die, too bad”. But at a meeting a couple of weeks later, science chiefs warned that without taking any protective measures the pandemic could kill , Brits, and aides were said to have realised they had to change course. No  strongly denied the report.

But we must stop this Conservative government reverting to bad old cutting ways when this crisis is over. Chancellor Rishi Sunak finally grasped that tens of billions must be spent protecting wages and livelihoods to save jobs and businesses. And that move is a repudiation of Torynomics. Yet victory will be temporaryCovid- in  is followed by choking austerity that strangled a stronger recovery after the  global banking collapse. Labour Left-winger John McDonnell’s pointed quip that the Tories are now also Marxists underlines the hollowness of Boris Johnson’s election claims that Labour would bankrupt the UK. Sunak being forced to borrow more than Gordon Brown in the financial crisis, and debt spiralling above £trillion, is as necessary as it was a dozen years ago. With % knocked off the FTSE- and unemployment poised to soar, Brown and TUC chief Frances O’Grady were on the side of the angels. The fear is Johnson and Sunak will repeat the mistakes of David Cameron and George Osborne – who wrongly blamed rising deficits  years ago on spending on nurses, teachers and the poor to justy self-defeating Tory squeezes on pay and services. History repeats itself first as tragedy then as farce, as McDonnell, the vindicated Marxist, reminded me in the recent past. Johnson has conveniently embraced the public intervention and regulation he ideologically decries but it isn’t his get-out-of-jail-free card. Labour’s likely next leader Keir Starmer must pin Johnson’s fatal errors on him.

The teenager was among  deaths in England, all in vulnerable groups including people with underlying health conditions. Yet as the UK’s death toll hit  and confirmed cases topped ,, sunseekers crowded popular spots despite terrying warnings of the consequences to society’s most vulnerable and an already struggling NHS. Police bosses had to warn people to stay away from beauty spots such as the Lake District, telling them: “This is not a holiday.” Boris Johnson threatened to shut parks and impose a curfewpeople fail to follow social distancing advice. The Prime Minister said: “If people don’t do that, then yes of course we’re going to have to bring in tougher measures.”He added: “We’ll think about this very actively in the next  hours. We need to think about the kind of measures we’ve seen where – other countries that have been forced to bring in restrictions on people’s movements altogether.” Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick warned: “We don’t want to go down that route. But this isn’t a game this is very serious.” Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries slammed the “dangerous” crowds filling public spaces and making outside environments “unavailable” to others, particularly the vulnerable who need to get fresh air as they self-isolate. Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said “le should not feel normal” now, andit did, you should ask “ you are doing the right things”. As crowds packed the Lake District over the weekend, Cumbria Assistant Chief Constable Andrew Slattery said: “A national emergency shutdown of businesses and schools is not an excuse for a holiday.” Tourists were also slammed for crowding into the North Yorkshire seaside town of Whitby.  Resident Lucy Whelan said: “They’ve queued for fish and chips, gone to the arcades and filled the car parks. And they should have stayed at home. Our incredible NHS are putting their lives at risk for us and yet some people are treating this as a holiday. They need to wake up – fast.” One of Britain’s biggest holiday companies, Parkdean Resorts, closed its  caravan and lodge parks today. The National Trust has also closed its parks, Cornwall’s Eden Project has closed and the Royal Horticultural Society has shut its gardens.  Lincolnshire’s Police and Crime Commissioner begged visitors to stay away from Skegness, following reports that the seaside resort was “packed” on Saturday.The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warned people across the country that although the spread of the virus was further advanced in the capital, “this is coming to you”. Stores across the High Street are closing down as the pandemic worsens. John Lewis is closing  stores and Debenhams is set to follow. Primark closed its stores until further notice. Pret A Manger, Starbucks and Harrods, are all also temporarily closing. But supermarkets remained packed, with selfish panic-buyers crashing shopping hours reserved for NHS workers. Footage showed hundreds of people at a Tesco in Dudley, West Mids, which opened at am for NHS staff only. Witnesses said shoppers were fighting, with a crush at the door.  A Tesco in Cambridgeshire had to shut after selfish shoppers invaded the NHS staff hour. A family at Tesco Extra in Gallions Reach, East London, rammed their trollies into the barriers in a bid to join the NHS shopping hour. And huge queues were seen at the Lidl at Balby in Doncaster, South Yorks. Bosses pleaded for an end to panic-buying. Tesco boss Dave Lewis urged shoppers to ask themselves: “Do I need everything in my trolley ” Co-operative boss Steve Murrells said: “People need to remain calm.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus much loved primary school","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Much-loved primary school headteacher dies just days after diagnosisRoose Primary School, in Cumbria, is mourning the \"huge loss\" of pioneering headteacher Wendy Jacobs who passed away in Furness General Hospital just days after being diagnosed with Covid-ShareCommentsByRuth OvensRyan Merrield:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-numbers-uk-deaths-rise-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-much-loved-primary-school-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The Department for Education has urged parents to keep their children at home unless their work is deemed critical to the countryaposs response to Covid- and they have no other childcare option.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: If your work is not critical in the response to coronavirus then please keep your child at home. This will help to halt the spread of the virus, protect the NHS and save lives.We will be closely monitoring what is happening in schools and will ensure they get the support they need in the weeks and months ahead. The closure, for all other pupils, has left some parents concerned about how they will take on the responsibility of homeschooling their kids. Oxford Home Schooling, a home education provider, has given some useful tips on how to homeschool children. Online tutoring service MyTutor has also put together some helpful advice, included below.Greg Smith, head of operations at Oxford Home Schooling, told Chronicle Live : “If you had a hundred home educators in a room, each of them would likely have a dferent approach, but there are a number of things you can do to get the most out of homeschooling.”Take breaks “A bit of experimentation should identy what works best for you. You might find -minute blasts followed by -minute breaks help keep your concentration up. Alternatively, you might prefer to work for longer periods at a stretch and then enjoy a longer break. “Boring as it might sound, giving your learning a predictable structure and routine does help to make sure you get everything done.” Get rid of distractions “It’s really hard to focus when the TV’s blaring, the radio’s on or there is lots going on in the place you’re working, so try and get rid of the distractions. Also, concentrating is easiest when you’re in a quiet, comfortable place, so play around with how you study – sitting, standing or lying down, inside or outside, with lots of light or without – and find a method that helps you concentrate.”  Divide up the work “Sometimes it can be dficult to motivate yourself when faced with a really big or dficult task. The best solution is to break it down into smaller pieces, planning out the ious stages that need completing before you start. This way, you’ll know what needs doing and you’ll get a good sense of progress as you work.” Get lots of sleep “It’s an accepted fact thatyou don’t get enough sleep, you’ll find it harder to concentrate, learn and retain information. The trick is pretty simple – get some sleep. Most people between the age of five and  need  to  hours of sleep per night, while  to -year-olds need  to  hours.” Don’t multi-task “Sometimes, particularly when there’s a lot of work to be done, it can be hard to resist the urge to multi-task and try and get lots of jobs done at once. This is best avoided though, as, in essence, you’re iding up the amount of brainpower you have available to a given task, meaning you might miss out on important bits of information.”For more tips on how to get the most out of homeschooling, visit Oxford Home Schoolingaposs website.  Meanwhile, Nicola Anderson, head of customer support at online tutoring service MyTutor, has also provided tips to help reassure parents. She says: Make sure they’ve got a space to work and the equipment they need Set up a desk in a quiet corner of the house where your child can keep their laptop, textbooks and notes - they’ll find it much easier to focus and the rest of the family can continue le as normal. Set good habits around phone use Teens spend a lot of time on apps speaking with their friends anyway - and isolation will only increase their desire to communicate socially. While some communication will be positive for their mental health, the opposite is true when social media fuels feelings of isolation and anxiety. You’ll need to set some ground rules for how phones are used during the day, and keep an eye on your child’s mood.  Help them organise their dayWithout the structure of the school day, and without the engagement of peers, motivation and energy can take a e. Help your child set up a timetable that’ll work for them and covers the subjects they need. Divide up periods of study with active breaks. Make sure your child moves, goes outside, eats meals at the appropriate times and has offline conversations. Have some go-to resources lined up You’re likely to run into situations where your child doesn’t understand some of their course content and you’re unable to help. In these situations, having some resources ready is wise. Look up the specications for the subjects your child is studying from the relevant exam boards and bookmark any online resources that can help you out. Save My Exams and S-cool are two handy sites.

Worryingly, this has resulted in many people thinking itaposs not too bad, with some even saying they donapost mindthey get it. Intensive care specialist Professor High Montgomery has explained why this really isnapost the case, and the staggering dference between the two illness. The main dference - and what makes it so much more dangerous - is it is far more contagious.Speaking to Channel , he explains thathe was to get the normal flu he would infect an average of . people.If they then go on to do the same, each of them infects . people. Do that  times, and heaposs responsible for  cases of the flu.  However, this strain of coronavirus - Covid- - is much more infectious.That means thathe was to get it, he would pass it to three people, and they would in turn pass it to another three. He said: Not that doesnapost sound like much of a dference, but each of those three passes it onto another three and that happens at ten layers, I have been responsibly for infecting , people.  Professor Montgomery goes on to explain why, despite some peopleaposs attitudes, itaposs so much worse than feeling a bit rough. He said: Most people are going to feel a bit pokey, or not very pokey, and feel just fine - but they will have spread it around. A few will get sick at about  days into their illness, so they will need to come to hospital. When they are in hospital they will consume resources and time and people will look after them, quite rightly, and they will be monitored to seethey become really, really sick.  He explains thatpeople become very ill they will be moved to an intensive care unit. This is the issue. If weaposve got a limit resource, which we have, a limited number of ventilators, a limited number of doctors, a limited number of nurses,we overwhelm that, we canapost provide that service of caring for people properly. He goes on to stress the point even further that itaposs vital that everybody does their bit to stop the spread.  He says: Itaposs going to be ugly, itaposs going to be horrible for a large number of people - but it will be a small number of people who get properly sick and a smaller percentage of those again that need to come to an intensive care unit. We can save the lives of a large number of those people.

And with some reports suggesting temperatures could reach C in the near future, bookmakers have been slashing the odds on spring being the hottest ever. Weather maps show air blowing from Portugal to Britain while the Met Office has confirmed highs climbing from C to C - C above average for some - by Wednesday across the UK.  Newcastle, York and Newtown are just some of the places expected to see the warmest temperatures. Weeks of floods and subzero cold snaps could soon be over, with the good sunshine forecast ahead of the clocks going forward to give an extra hour of evening sunlight from the weekend. The Met Office forecasts mostly dry conditions for  days, going some way to cheering the country as it stays home and enjoys time in the garden.  The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: Sunshine will help boost the mood, with an extended period of settled and dry conditions after recent monthsapos widespread flooding. Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending said: We will tap into air from further south in Europe through the early part of the week, with daytime temperatures rising. Drier continental winds are now blowing across the UK. The apostapsapos have been turned off after wet and windy westerlies plagued us through winter.

Louise Katz, , believes she and her husband Stephen, , contracted Covid- on holiday in Italy last month. The psychology teacher and doctoral researcher at Derby University had gone with her husband to the Venice Carnival on February  for four days. It was not until later it was announced that Italy had become a hotspot for the virus. Now fully recovered from coronavirus, but still self-isolating at her home in Watford, Herts, she said the couple did “every stupid thing imaginable” after they phoned  the first time.  Louise said: “We didn’t have symptoms until a week after we ed. I had a sore throat, but nothing major so I wasn’t taking any medication. “The aches started a day or two afterwards and it really hurt. It was in my hands and arms and feet - my calves were horrendous. “It came out dferently with my husband. He was sweating, he had the sore throat but he didn’t have the aches. “I spoke to  and they said we couldn’t have it because it wasn’t in their guidelines of travel to Italy at the time. They just told us to carry on as normal so we did. “I was taking paracetamol, which did help. Thankfully I didn’t take Nurofen which is usually my go to. “I was putting it down to the way I sit in my home office or because I trudge through mud for two hours when I walk the dogs in the morning, so I went out and got a massage.  “My husband was still having symptoms and had to go away on business to New Orleans.  said to carry on so we did! “In hindsight, everything we did was stupid.” Louise said her fever, which went as high as  celsius , came and went intermittently. Louise added: “ needs to change. It’s too rigid in its approach, especially as I’ve read the virus affects people in dferent ways. “I want to know whether we’re going to be tested to prove we’ve had it  Are we going to have to prove we have the antibodies to be allowed out in society  “There are going to be millions of us who believe we’ve had it but don’t know for certain. If everyone’s having similar symptoms, it’s likely we have. “It really wipes you out. It’s not like a cold or a flu where you bounce back quickly. My husband is working from home and he’s still falling asleep at pm on the sofa.” Louise said she believes that people are being whipped up in a “frenzy” over an illness that will likely not kill youyou do not fit into a high risk group. She said: “It’s not pleasant, but you can survive it. We know who the high risk groups are and they need to be kept safe. “But why is everyone  being thrown into a panic  We’re not all going to die of this. We’ll have a few weeks of feeling crap and then we’ll be OK. “I’m concerned about people being isolated at home. Psychologically, it could be very damagingit carries on for a long time.

Rather than go through the heartbreak of watching you leave the house every day, the doggos now have permanent working, playing and napping partners.The excitement proved too much to handle for little Rolo the Dachshund, who was so delighted his owners chose to quarantine with him during the coronavirus crisis that he sprained his tail from wagging it so much.His owner, Emma Smith, became concerned after noticing the sausage dogaposs tail had aposstopped workingapos.She wrote on Twitter : So my dog has been so happy that everyone is home for quarantine, that his tail has stopped working, so we went to the vet and the vet said ‘he had sprained his tail from excessively wagging it’. Roloaposs adorable story racked up more than one million likes on social media, with Emma later adding an update for his new army of loyal followers. She said: Didn’t expect this happen. For those asking, he is currently on pain relief and the vet said he should be healed within a week, this is him on the nd day. He is super happy and there is now movement from side to side but he is struggling to lt it up in the air. Emma also added a video of Rolo receiving some appreciated belly rubs and thanked everyone for their concern with an older clip of the little woofer spinning his tail like a helicopter in the garden, saying heaposll be back to his happy wagging ways in no time.

I was not going to share my story, but now that I see others are reporting very dferent symptoms than mine I feel it’s important to tell everyone my experience, she wrote. Julia went on to tweet a timeline of her illness, in diary-form. February th: I woke up this day in agony, her first post read. My head was pounding, my ears throbbing, and it felt asmy throat was on fire. My body ached, I had chills, and I had a fever of .. I took over the counter anti-inflammatories and stayed in bed the entire day.  The next tweet jumped forward to Juliaaposs last day in Italy, on March rd. I still couldn’t hear, and at this point I lost all ability to taste and smell, yet I did not have a runny nose or cough, it read. I had a headache constantly during the day which I just treated with Tylenol. I left the next morning toto America. She described March th as the day that scared her to look back on. I flew home, and not a single person asked where I had been. Not even at customs. They didn’t blink an eye at me. I had layovers in LARGE cities. Again, there was no doubt in my mind that I didn’t have the virus. March th-th: As we were told, I stayed in self quarantine during these days, the next tweet read. I had contact with only two people. No symptoms were present that the CDC warned us about. I had a WET cough. And my hearing, taste, and smell finally ed. On Friday  March, Julia got tested for the virus. This was not her plan, she explained, but rather the consequence of having family members working in the health sector, who wanted her to be sure she was well before ing to work. She had to ask repeatedly to be tested, according to her tweets. Julia said she got a call on March , informing her she had tested positive for Covid-. My jaw DROPPED, she recalled.  How was I positive  I didn’t have the symptoms on the news, I got cleared by a doctor, and no one cared. ..at customs I had come from a high risk country. I guess why I’m telling you all of this is because what they are telling you are symptoms are not ALL symptoms. And you do NOT have to have the symptoms to be positive. The only symptom I had that was similar was a fever. Julia said she didnapost know how she had been infected.

After five days of staying at home and measuring his temperature, the costume designer went to receive some medical care and checks. He fainted during the assessment and was rushed to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.

They ran some tests on me every four hours, with no information or telling me what I have or what’s wrong with me, I was shaking and felt like I was dying with only IVs in my arm. After they took some blood and swabbed my nose for a covid- test I waited again until am in the morning. I got discharged and sent home after  hours in the ER and instructed to only take Tylenol. Tarek, who has designed costumes for Ru Paulaposs Drag Race, was critical of the level of care he received.  The hospitals and USA is completely unprepared for this, he said. I don’t recommend relying on hospitals or the healthcare system. After four days I got my test result back that I am positive. I still have the same symptoms with no progress, but I started developing pneumonia and can’t breathe normally because there is no cure. It was followed by coughing blood. Now I have no fever but I still can’t breath normally, apparently the virus has spread into my lungs.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter. I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening. Changing that for me has been dficult.“Since we’ve been off I’ve been getting a longer lie and going to meet up with some people.“Fin Robertson is one of the local boys so we’ve gone for coffee.“It’s the same struggles that everyone is having – going to the shops and not being able to get handwash and stuff like that.“It’s dficult to do anything really because there is nothing concrete to say when we are going to restart.”When the Dark Blues do finally get back out on the pitch, Kerr expects the good form since the start of February to continue as Dundee look to put their up-and-down start to le in the Championship behind them.“I had said from day one we had a really good group of players at the club and I don’t think it was expected we would be so inconsistent,” he added.“The boys who came in in January have all brought something and we had been doing well up until the shutdown.“We have a standard to meet every day and,we were still playing, we would expect to be getting better and better.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – What the coronavirus could mean for Dundee and Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-what-the-coronavirus-could-mean-for-dundee-and-dundee-united embed # secreteTtVElWoIb\" data-secret\"eTtVElWoIb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc dundee united simon murray transfer","story":"Former Dundee and Dundee United striker Simon Murray is targeting ato the Scottish game this summer after playing his last game in South Africa.Murray, , hopes an extension to this season due to the coronavirus shutdown might even see him back in action on home soil before the end of the campaign.The Dundonian has enjoyed the last  months on an adventure at Bidwest Wits in the South African top flight but has had to spend almost the entirety of this season on the sidelines.A damaged cruciate ligament early in the campaign required surgery which saw his place in the squad taken up.Speaking from Johannesburg, he told the Tele: “I hurt my knee in the third game of the season and needed an operation so I’ve been out six-and-a-half months.“Because there’s a limit on the number of foreign players over here, the club signed another forward when I was injured and took my place so we’ve come to an agreement to terminate my contract when I’m fit.“The club have been really good, to be honest, they’ve made sure I got through the injury and looked after me during rehab.“The plan was to stay here in South Africa, get the rehab done and recover from the injury and then head back to Scotland in the summer but because of all this coronavirus it is up in the air.”Murray revealed there has already been interest in his services, once he is back up and running, from Premiership and Championship clubs.He said: “During the injury, I’ve had some interest from a few teams. Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

But, at the same time, I also completely disagree.While our minds are being blown with stress and mild panic about being shut in our homes and where we’re going to locate our next roll of toilet paper, we all desperately need a release to think about something .Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney + and the rest will be doing a roaring trade right now as people figure out what to fill spare time with.It’s exactly the same for football debate – there’s no games but that doesn’t stop the debate, thankfully.Doesn’t make le easy for a football writer, mind you . . .Nor is it easy for the likes of Ian Maxwell and Neil Doncaster as they attempt to navigate the minefield that is now our game.The big clubs haven’t wasted any time in applying pressure for what they want to see – Celtic want to be awarded the title, Rangers obviously disagree and Hearts don’t want to be relegated.I have to say, apart from the Hearts viewpoint, it’s all pretty nauseating.What the heid honchos have on their plate right now is probably the biggest decision ever in the history of Scottish football.The Rangers Sevco debate pales in comparison and it’s not like we’ve ever heard the end of that one in Glasgow.Definitely rather them than me. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, whatever decision they come to, it’s going to hurt somebody.And I think they were right to give themselves some breathing space with Monday’s statement.Personally, I’d have picked a date in the middle of April and said we’ll see what’s what at that point with some plans thought up in the meantime.Initially, I was in favour of restarting the season in the autumn and then running straight into the new one, maybe scrap the League Cup. The transfer window and players’ contracts ending in May June just makes that a can of worms.Now, though, I’ll echo my colleague Lee Wilkie’s thoughts yesterday – expand the structure and keep as many clubs happy as possible.As in so many situations in le – do what big Wilkie says . . .It was only right Uefa postpone the European Championship until next summer – there was no other call to make.The championships would have put a completely unreasonable time limit on getting club football – whenever it gets going again – finished in time.However, the decision to knock the qualying play-offs back to June seems very short-sighted.I would be delightedany football is played before June, to be honest.I really think we’re in for a long, long haul of society shutting down to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.And Uefa should be aware they will likely just have to kick the can on the play-offs down the road again in three months’ time.They are such massive games for countries like us and I’m sure Scotland boss Steve Clarkewill want his players to have been in action for a few weeks going into the Israel game.Very little of this situation is fair but I can’t help but think Uefa have been a bit quick to make these decisions.Dundee and Dundee United have more to lose from this season being cancelled than almost anybody.Hearts would be the exception and possibly Partick.However, missing out on a place in the Premiership, particularly for United when it was nailed on, would be massively unfair. The Dark Blues can make an argument themselves about the play-offs, too.The work, and pots of cash, already put in this season has to count for something.THE world might be going down the drain but I have to try to see a silver lining. With the season stopped and, possibly declared null and void, my team Queen of the South can’t be relegated, so there’s that . . ."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-gorbals-vampire-stalked-city-streets","story":"IT HAS gone down in history as one of the most spine-chilling moments in Glasgowrsquos ghoulish past."},{"url":null,"title":"wyndford-residents-demand-better-cleaning","story":"MARYHILL residents have blasted social landlord Cube for ldquototal lack of hygiene protocol for protecting tenants during the coronavirus crisis."},{"url":null,"title":"residents-slam-fly-tippers-mess-left-port-glasgow-street","story":"ANGRY residents are calling for housing bosses to step in and remove rubbish dumped in a Port Glasgow street."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-popular-bongos-bingo-running-free-stream-glasgow-clubbers-show-cancellations","story":"Glasgow clubbers have been left stuck at home amid the coronavirus pandemic with little to do but fill their glasses and stick on Kerrang or Hits Radio in a bid to feel normal."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-glasgows-shed-cancels-plans-one-last-sesh","story":"A Glasgow nightclub that had planned on hosting \"one last sesh\" despite government advice has now announced they have \"forcibly closed\"."},{"url":null,"title":"john-lewis-shut-50-stores-due-coronavirus-pandemic","story":"John Lewis Partnership has made the ldquodficult decision to temporarily close all  John Lewis shopsas a result of the coronavirus crisis."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-garngad-takeaway-goes-flames","story":"A Glasgow takeaway has been forced to shut after the ground floor went up in flames on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-nicola-sturgeon-says-parks-not-full-says-dont-gather-weddings-celebrations","story":"The First Minister has hit out at those flocking to parks and beaches as she announcedthe government advice on preventing the spread of coronavirus is \"not optional\"."},{"url":null,"title":"janice-bell-pans-people-pussycat-dolls","story":"LAST weekend eight of us descended on Arran for a girlsrsquo weekend.

If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility. But the government does say people who are self-isolating can keep windows open to get fresh air.Whatrsquos social distancing The government is advising everyone who is not currently self-isolating to still practise social distancing.This means not meeting with friends and family, staying away from crowded areas, avoiding all non-essential travel, and working from home where possible.Luckily for these people, there is no restriction on going for walks outside. The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

Chocolate-box we arenrsquot. All around are plots so lush and well-tended they could be entered at Cha. Our patch is not in their league. Looking out to hills at the back, it opens onto a field, where sheep huddle at night under a blackthorn by our gate, leaving wisps of wool every morning. Chicken wire intended to keep out rabbits has been gnawed by marauders for whom our mossy, tufty grass is irresistible. Nor can we grow a dense hedge to discourage them because, wersquove been told, the horses who share the field with the sheep would bring our wooden fence crashing down as they leaned over to munch it. And needless to say, nothing can keep out the nettles, which wave wildly at me after itrsquos been raining, like kids on a school bus.Burying myself in a rose catalogue is a definition of day-dreaming. The David Austin Handbook of Roses, gted by a green-fingered friend, is jam-packed with temptation. One of the delights of summer is to be taken around this friendrsquos delectable garden. A riot of sweet peas, foxgloves and hollyhocks, with soaring old trees casting welcome shade, its walls are swagged with clematis and honeysuckle. Thanks to her, I now go to sleep in the company of roses called Roald Dahl, Tam OrsquoShanter or The Pilgrim, after the Canterbury Tales. Therersquos Gabriel Oak, hero of Thomas Hardyrsquos Far from the Madding Crowd, or the mercurial Eustacia Vye, from The Return of the Native. Planted together, would they get on or would the results be another tragedy  I seem to remember Darcey Bussell was once askedshe would rather be given a damehood or have a rose named after her. She now has both.Vita Sackville-West was a self-confessed sucker for catalogues. The doyenne of Sissinghurst Castle, in Kent, which she turned into a horticultural paradise with her husband Harold Nicolson, she also wrote a very practical gardening column for The Observer. Early in the autumn of  she complained that catalogues were arriving by every post. ldquoIt is dficult to keep onersquos head. I always lose mine.... Experience tells me that I ought to resist, but, like the poor mutt who falls to the card-sharper in the train, I fall to every list offering plants I cannot afford to buy and could not cultivate successfully evenI could afford them.She was at work when nurseries were only reluctantly opening their doors to amateurs and garden centres were almost unheard of. Catalogues were the way to buy seeds, and seedlings, and set your plot up for the coming year. Many folk in Hoolet have their own greenhouses and potting sheds, but itrsquos as much as I can do to plant something bought in a pot and keep it alive long enough for it to learn to fend for itself. I speak encouragingly to each new arrival, hoping that snow and wind donrsquot kill it before the roots have taken, or some night-time critter digs it up for a taste of bonemeal in which itrsquos bedded.When it comes to roses, I was cheered by the poet James Fentonrsquos advice. He wrote a book about growing a garden from  packets of seed, but with one important caveat: ldquoI do not propose that you start your roses in this way: That would be, as Peter Pan says of death, an awfully big adventure.Seed catalogues are for experts and connoisseurs, a higher level of botanical sophistication and dedication than I ever expect to reach. The New Yorker writer Katharine S White was a devoted gardener at her Maine farmhouse where she lived with her husband, E B White. I have a collection of her gardening columns, Onward  Upward in the Garden, which are surprisingly and disappointingly dull. Occasionally, though, she surprises me.Among her prized catalogues were those by the Calornian rose expert, Will Tillotson. He had a very distinctive style. Indeed, as you find your feet in this new field of prose, you discover all these writers become as identiable as Ernest Hemingway or Muriel Spark. Thinking up new ways of conveying the essence of hundreds of roses must be challenging, and Tillotson once showed the strain: ldquoOh gentle reader, he wrote, ldquoforgive meyou are lsquosleepyrsquo or bored or annoyed. The tired catalogue writer has emptied his sack of adjectives at your feet. This phrase was used as the sign-off to his last catalogue, printed shortly after his death. It was a poignant envoi.The David Austin Handbook is also posthumous, carrying the news of ldquoMr Arsquos death at the end of . He was a Shropshire Lad, which might explain the profusion of literary names and references in his glorious collection and the clarity of the puffs for each plant. As with all plant catalogue writers, the descriptions are as glowing aseach specimen was one of the authorrsquos own brood.I donrsquot think of myself as particularly impetuous, but I anticipate a moment when, like Sackville-West, I too might lose my head. The rosette-like iety named after Anne Boleyn would be fitting, but Irsquom drawn to the simpler kind that remind me of dog-roses found in hedgerows: Open Arms, Rosa complicata, Morning Mist, Fru Dagmar Hastrup, or Rosa rugosa alba, the one known as The Jacobite, with its old-fashioned fragrance, innocent white flowers and wicked thorns."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-nardini-moorings-owner-claudio-nardini-pleads-scots-stay-home","story":"Hordes of people were seen on Largs shorefront on Saturday despite government advice to stay indoors and keep a safe distance from others to stop the spread of COVID-.Now,Claudio Nardini,co-owner at Nardiniat the Moorings, has announced his cafe will completely close in order to convince people to stay safe.Taking to Facebook, Mr Nardini wrote: \"Seeing the prom rammed with people and dozens of cars queuing for the ferry today like nothing was out of the ordinary really saddened me.: Restaurantowners in tears over abusive messages after offering NHS staff free meals\"Everyone at work today was overcome with a strange feeling of guilt, almost aswe were contributing to this madness.

It is all part of what Fry called a slowed down le, his recipe for getting through these trying times.It might have been thought that hearing from Fry, pleasant as it is, would have been low down the list of priorities for a Sunday politics show. But as we were constantly hearing during Brexit, and now with the coronavirus, these are unprecedented times. Ways of working have to change.Broadcasters have revamped schedules , dropped some political programmes , added new features , and repurposed other programmes . STVrsquos Scotland Tonight had already added a peak-time slot on Thursdays, a move station chiefs say has ldquomore than trebled the audience.Ridge on Sunday looked the same. Interviewees are often at an outside location. The sets desk is already big enough for social distancing, so Jeremy Corbyn could be interviewed in the studio. It was not all broadcast business as usual, though. The Labour leader did mention he and host Sophy Ridge had not shaken hands. He did not ulge, alas,they had gone for an elbow bump or a foot taps instead.On Marr there were changes, including cutting the paper review to two contributors, in this case the corporationrsquos health editor Hugh Pym, and Roula Khalaf, editor of the FT, who was at home.In the studio, Marr and Pym were the regulation two metres apart. The distance, coincidentally, is Pymrsquos height. For anyone unsure what two metres looks like, Pymrsquos we Susan, who describes herself on Twitter as ldquoa London-based Scot, has helpfully posted a picture of him lying on the ground with the hashtag #BeLikeHughBeTwo.With all this innovation going on, it seemed perfectly reasonable for Stephen Fry to rock up in a Marr show that also included scientists, doctors, the Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, and the London Mayor Sadiq Khan.Fry, being president of the mental health charity MIND, and someone who has suffered from depression, turned out to be the ideal talking head when it came to the subject of maintaining good mental health in these stressful days.What is the best way, asked Marr, for people to cope with the current barrage of bad news, particularlythey live alone or are in self-isolation.You have to redefine your sense of time, said Fry. Start by drawing up a timetable for your day. Take more time to do everything. Turn off notications on devices so le is not a constant din of pings. Take breaks from the news and look inand when you want.ldquoThere is so much noise, he said. ldquoEverybody wants to have a point of view, everybody wants to show how splendid they are, or to show how awful the world is, and people want to paint a picture of an apocalypse.\"The fact isyou listen to the scientic advisers they almost always begin every sentence with lsquowe thinkrsquo, lsquoitrsquos possiblersquo, lsquomaybersquo, lsquoperhapsrsquo, lsquowe donrsquot know ,butrsquo. Thatrsquos how experts talk, people who really understand it.So we have to live with uncertainty, said Marr.Thatrsquos not a bad thing, replied Fry.

The Nest is set in Monersquos hometown of Glasgow. While ostensibly a drama about surrogacy, it is really a tale of two cities, two Scotlands, the haves and the have nots.Property developer Dan and his musician we Emily , have everything, including a stunning lochside home, but not the child they long for.Kayahas a flat in Possil with barely a stick of furniture in it, and the kind of temper that sees her threaten to stab her case worker with a bottle.The opposites collide when Emily gets lost one night and hits -year-old Kaya with her car. So far, so Bonfire of the Vanities. The teen starts to work her way into the older womanrsquos le and, long story short, offers to be a surrogate infor pound,.Dan thinks this is a crazy idea, not to mention illegal. As does his sister, his lawyer, Emilyrsquos colleague, and probably every viewer watching. Many a drama would struggle to get beyond such a point, but the writer here is Nicole Taylor , who carefully takes each objection and picks away at it.: Susan Swarbrick meets Martin CompstonUltimately, the viewer has to believe that Emily is unhinged by grief, and that Dan would give in because he is desperate to keep her. Madness happens when people convince themselves a situation is all or nothing, black or white. That is how noir works.Even so, Taylorrsquos story is such a high-wire act that it needs to keep propelling itself onwards at speed or it will crash to the ground in a heap of improbabilities.Helping immensely with the task of keeping the viewer on side is a terric cast. Rundle is a convincing mix of fierce determination and eggshell fragility. Mack, a real find, does that bravest of things as an actor and makes herself an unlikeable pain in the neck.Then there is Compston. Once the prince of Sunday nights as Essex wide boy DS Arnott in Line of Duty, he is even better back on his home turf and in his own accent.It was a nice touch by Taylor to make Dan a bad boy made good, eventhe working class middle class contrast was laid on a a bit thick. Every time Kaya appeared the score would slip into menacing music mode, as though people who do not live in beautul lochside homes were naturally best avoided.What a house, mind.

The scientic community is ided over the best way forward and we are following a particular reading of the science. WHO has consistently advised all countries to test, track and trace every suspected case of the virus. The overwhelming majority of national governments are taking this approach.The UK Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesis the body advising our politicians. As far as I understand, Sage does not believe we can contain the virus using the WHOrsquos methodology. Our Government is, therefore, not making the same effort as others to stop the virus spreading, while attempting to control it in a manner that doesnrsquot put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak. The reason we are testing four times less than Germany is more to do with a dference in approach, rather than an issue of capacity.I am not a scientic authority so my opinion is worth little on this matter. However, the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach is concerning, given the WHOrsquos history in dealing with virus outbreaks. What I find alarming is the lack of discussion, and seeming lack of knowledge, about the path we are on.We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. ldquoWe know best ndash trust us will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn, time is of the essence and so much is at stake.Much of what we usually do has become irrelevant in these extraordinary times. Conversely, this situation demands us to be well informed about certain things most of us would normally have little interest in. A widespread understanding of how our Government is trying to tackle this coronavirus is crucial to overcoming it.Kennedy Stewart, Lerwick.WHILE the Government is to be commended for much of the action taken so far and as the country and the NHS buckles down to cope with possibly then greatest challenge since the Second World War, there is one shut-down whose consequences, I suggest, may not have been fully considered.I refer to that affecting patients suffering from inoperable and incurable cancers, of which I, unfortunately, am one. We have been informed that endoscopy units, where palliative care such as periodically burning of the growth with lasers takes place, have been closed indefinitely.Last summer, I was given the bleak prognosis of anything from six months to  months. My cancer was subjected to laser burning and not only do I neither look or feel like a cancer sufferer, my tumour had actually shrunk slightly after my last treatment.There will be, I am sure, many more like me throughout Scotland, people whose le expectancy depends on the success of this treatment and I have no wish to jump any queue. But it seems illogical to me to deny treatment to people who actually need it, so that resources can be erted and reserved for those who might need it.I realise the NHS is and will be under tremendous pressure in the weeks and months to come and that only a minority are thus affected, but surely the Government has a duty of care to us as much as to potential Covid- victims I have been told that the only way I might be treated will beI become an emergency case, i.e.I begin to bleed uncontrollably, or my oesophagus obstructs. By then, I suggest, it may be beyond remedy.Surely, we too are entitled to hope for such le as can be procured for us by this vital treatment to spend with our loved ones.Charles Duncan, Glasgow G.THIS Covid- crisis must surely spell the end of the road for our self-indulgent entitlement society with its emphasis upon the rights of the inidual.Now we must recapture a sense of responsibility and sacrice to protect the community at large.Only today I heard of a shopper displaying the height of irresponsibility in a local supermarket.That person was wandering through the aisles, coughing, sneezing and spluttering while making no attempt to cover nostrils or mouth.Shops would be well advised to put up posters at their entrances in bold, clear type asking customers displaying such symptoms not to enter their stores and to get neighbours to shop for them or order their goods online.Knowing full well that the NHS could well be swamped with so many cases that they will be unmanageable, we may have to adopt the time-honoured custom of women and children first in an emergency.If the hospital system reaches such a breaking point, then priorities about deciding who can be treated successfully will have to come into the equation.These are hard choices but they will have to be taken in the interests of the wider community.The Devil Take The Hindmost and the Irsquom all right Jack mentalities have to be flushed out of our societal systemwe are to survive as a species.This pandemic is but one manestation of where responsibilities need to take precedence over rights.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.WHILE there has been justied criticism of panic buyers and hoarders in the current Coronavirus emergency, there is another type whose activities are even more deserving of the publicrsquos scorn, namely the profiteers.Yesterday, when we were down our last bar of our preferred soap, Imperial Leather, I idly browsed eBay. Prices for this soap ied from around pound a bar, not unreasonable, to pound for six, to three figures for the same, but as far as pound, for six bars. It seems that some scabrous Thatcherites are cashing in on the shortages that they have helped to create. At the same time online footage of a tearful nurse at the end of a y sht gazing at supermarket shelves picked clean by ldquolocusts arouses our indignation. While Kevin McKennawrites in hope that the current emergency may bring out the best in our citizenry, the evidence seems to suggest the reverse. Forty years of neo-liberalist doctrines backed by successive Conservative governments are reaping their grim harvest.Similar outbreaks of profiteering occurred at the beginning of both world wars and eventually the governments of the day, deciding that ldquothe market was not sacrosanct, introduced rationing. While this may be an over-reaction at this point, eBay should consider action to prevent leeches taking advantage of the short-term misery of health and other key workers.Larry Cheyne, Bishopbriggs.MANY thanks and congratulations to Tom Gordon for his article ldquoDeath was doing the rounds long before the virus arrived . The statistics he provides are a much-needed reality check on the current Covid situation and should give us all pause for reflection.Jessie Reid, Dalry.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WHEN anti-coronavirus measures are being considered, may I ask for the importance of walking for exercise for the sake of onersquos health to be taken on board It seems to be that ldquostay at home is being used as meaning the same as ldquodonrsquot mix with others, but they arenrsquot equivalent. The latter is highly desirable, but there is no need to stay at home to walk in the countryside or along a canal, where the risk of catching or spreading infection would appear to be negligible.People need exercise as well as dogs. As a dogless walker, I have the experience of being looked at strangely because I walk without a dog.Paul Brownsey, Bearsden.HAVING failed to be able to buy contributions for the food bank at a supermarket I wonderthey could set up an online contribution service. People could even select from a list of items most needed at food banks, pay, and the items could be kept behind thescenes to be distributed directly as a priority.Elizabeth Allen, Glasgow G.THANK you so such much for your very moving front pageldquoWhen yoursquore on your own, we are there with you and the words signed by your editor, Donald Martin.

Nobody could have predicted the scale of the devastation, both socially and economically, wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. With large swathes of the economy essentially forced to shut up shop for months - and faced by the quick and unied action of the trade unions - Mr Sunak was left with little alternative but to make this unprecedented intervention, the like of which was not even seen in wartime, and which will almost certainly end up dwarfing the bank bailout of  by comparison.By forcing the Conservative government into a corner on this state intervention, the pandemic has also forced them to admit some truths that many would rather stayed hidden. Large-scale borrowing is possible. Citizens can be bailed out, not just banks and business. There can be support when things go wrong. Therersquos always been enough to go round.These are truths that have long been scoffed at when those on the left tried to highlight them - most recently Jeremy Corbynrsquos Labour Party in last yearrsquos General Election which, unbelievably, took place just three months ago. Plans for wide-ranging nationalisation, the abolishment of tuition fees and free broadband for all were made a laughing stock of by opposition politicians and establishment media alike, whose taunting most often took some form of the question ldquohow are you going to pay for that Many will remember the BBCrsquos Emma Barnett mockingly asking Angela Raynerthe party wanted to nationalise sausages it wasnrsquot necessary for the Conservative Chancellor to specically mention meat-based products in last weekrsquos announcement when he essentially nationalised almost every industry in the country in one quick sweep.When former prime minister Theresa May infamously remarked that ldquothere isnrsquot a magic money tree we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want, it was in response to a nurse whose pay had been frozen for eight years and who was struggling to survive on her wage. If it seemed callous at the time, it seems unthinkable in the current moment. Not only does the magic money tree exist, underpaid nurses and their like should be first in line to shake it.Because while Mr Sunak deserves few platitudes for doing the only thing possible and conscionable under current circumstances, he will surely be credited with changing politics forever. Now wersquove seen that money can be borrowed to help those in need, how can we ever justy leaving people homeless on the streets  Now we know therersquos no limit on the cost of state intervention, why should anyone struggling ever have to pay for childcare  When itrsquos clear that political will is all that stands between poverty and the spending of trillions of pounds, how can we ever look at a foodbank again The genie is out of the bottle: the free market is not infallible or inevitable ending inequality is possible. Things can never be the same again.Of course, this is not the utopia that any on the left would wish for. Short-term crisis response is not an ideology, and nor is the maintained concentration of the levers of power with a small group of politicians socialism. But the scale of intervention pledged by Sunak cannot be overstated or removed from its context in history: in the UK, in our letimes and beyond, we have never seen the likes of it.Coronavirus has already put immense strain on the worldrsquos citizens and the global economy, with far worse expected to come. Praise for Mr Sunak has been widespread across the political and media class since his announcement, with many who have long sneered at ldquoCorbynomics lauding the Chancellor for his decisive leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-costa-coffee-nandos-temporarily-close-outlets","story":"The chicken chain said in a statement on its website on Sunday that all  stores will shut ldquountil further notice, with takeaway and delivery services also suspended.The company, which employs around , people, said it is working closely with its teams across the UK to ldquomake sure that everybody affected is supported during the coming weeks.Lots of love, Nandorsquos # pic OxIGVeUSldquoEat in, takeaway and delivery for customers will all stop until further notice and our remaining food will be given away to those who need it most across the community.A statement posted on its Twitter account said it would try to keep cafes open in hospitals, with NHS staff to receive free coffee for the next two weeks.The coffee chain said staff at closed stores will be paid their full average weekly pay over eight weeks.:Ferry services to no-longer take non-essential travellersIt comes after McDonaldrsquos announced all of its restaurants in the UK and Ireland will close by pm on Monday to protect the safety of its employees and customers.The fast-food chain, which has , employees in the UK and Ireland, posted a statement about the ldquodficult decision to Twitter ndash adding that stores will close by that time on Monday ldquoat the latest."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-health-secretary-blasts-snp-colleague-ignoring-distancing-rules","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has repeatedly stressed that social distancing rules are \"not optional\" and must be followed.She has now called on all politicians to physically close their constituency offices and lead by example.SNP MSP John Mason posted on Twitter that his Glasgow Shettleston constituency office will remain open, despite the social distancing advice issued by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoMy staff and I are keen to be as available as possible to constituentsso wersquore keeping our office open Monday to Friday, am ndash pm.ldquoAll my surgeries will now be in my office.

This time is no dferent.“However, the way we will play our part in keeping food and drink flowing has changed in this current crisis, and we have the systems in place.  We have already taken the responsible decision that NFU Scotland Head Office staff will work from home and any meetings or gatherings are suspended so all the work will be getting done in a dferent way.“Modern technology now gives all our professional staff the ability to work effectively using teleconferencing, video conferencing, email, social media, mobile phones, laptops and more, meaning daily contact with Government, key industry stakeholders, internal contacts and our members is as seamless as possible.“With dficult decisions being made on an hourly basis, technology provides us with the s to remain fully informed and engaged on all the key issues that are currently being discussed with urgency and at the highest level.“The technology and goodwill exists to make this work, and the desire is there from everyone at NFUS to be pushing on, ensuring the best support and representation of the industry at all levels on all issues continues unabated.“We also urge our community to look out for one another at this time, especially those who may be vulnerable or isolated, without access to internet, phone or mobile signal that many take for granted.“And a reminder for those who need emotional, practical or financial support in times of need, our rural charity RSABI is there to support people in Scottish agriculture and can be contacted on   .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

The shutters are down and doors are locked as we walk past The Harp Bar, The Dark Horse, The Dirty Onion, The Thirsty Goat,  Social, The Cloth Ear, The National ... you get the picture.Some establishments like The Spaniard and Pablos took the precaution of protecting their shop windows by having them boarded up with a wood facade, evoking a sad reminder of the aftermath of bars blown up or firebombed during the Troubles.Pubs along Belfast#s famous entries - The Morning Star, The Jailhouse and Henry#s - were remarkable only in the fact that darkness enveloped the alleys rather than the bright vibrancy of nightle.Belfast city centre amid the lockdown was a haunting contrast to the norm, with the stillness and quiet a world away from sounds of music, chatter and laughter that normally fill those pubs, restaurants, streets and alleyways.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseHill Street in the city centreKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappHill Street in the city centreBut one ray of light comes in the form of Willie Jack, owner of Cathedral Quarter mainstays The Duke of York, The Dark Horse and The Harp Bar, as well as The Friend at Hand Whiskey Shop.He told the Belfast : Outside The Duke of York we#re going to change the umbrellas to something, we#ll do a few art installations for the brighter days ahead, whether it#s six weeks or eight weeks or more.And there#s a new neon to hand, installations for above the buildings and we will kick back in, there will be things by The Dark Horse in that courtyard.We will be lighting up the umbrellas and neons again soon and we will be doing more exciting projects to make Belfast brighter again.

Rev Tom McKnight, the Methodist President-elect and minister of Donaghadee Methodist Church, said that they did not have the technical services to stream, and because he felt most of his parishioners did not have the social media experience for streaming, he made sure that everyone received a #Worship at Home# sheet produced by the British Methodist Church.However, he watched a streamed service from Mountpottinger Methodist Church, his previous posting.

This has reassured many people that their jobs and livelihoods will be sustained during this unprecedented health crisis. However, many workers, including sole traders, the self-employed, people on zero-hour contracts, and agency workers fall outside the scope of the scheme. This is causing huge anxiety and I urge you to take urgent action to support them also.His plea was echoed by Economy Minister Diane Dodds who, writing in today#s Belfast , revealed the Executive is asking Westminster to recty this for the self-employed and sole traders.The Executive has asked Treasury to extend support to this category, either by averaging out the past years# earnings to calculate a figure or by paying a guaranteed income, she said.Her comments come as one of her ministerial predecessors, Lord Empey, appealed for more help for small and micro-businesses here.He said these smaller-scale operations are facing the biggest challenge they have ever confronted.The former Ulster Unionist leader also called on Invest NI to fund grants so that these smaller enterprises could seek advice from accountancy and advice companies to see out the coronavirus crisis. Firms in Northern Ireland offering such services could include PwC or Grant Thornton.Lord Empey noted that while there have been a series of announcements in recent days from the Chancellor and Executive offering help, many of these schemes have not been fully worked out, and many of our small businesses are immediately starved of cash with forced closures and no customers.The peer added: I think it would be helpfulInvest NI, working with the Department for the Economy, drew up a scheme to offer professional help to these businesses and iniduals to help guide people though the complexity of what is on offer. Such a scheme could give grants to these firms to engage accountants and business advisers on the best way forward for them and to help them establish what help they can apply for.I would also ask that the main accountancy bodies... would undertake this work at as modest a cost as possible, making this their contribution to the restoration of our economy. Now is the time to act. It will cost less in the end than having to pay out vast amounts of unemployment and other benefits in the future.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus: Ulster Hospital consultant in online plea as she warns huge numbers could diepeople do not heed adviceIn a hard-hitting video posted on Twitter at the weekend, Ulster Hospital respiratory consultant Dr Julia Courtney spelled out the scale of the looming healthcare disaster facing Northern Ireland and its people, warning that huge numbers of people will die.CoronavirusCoronavirus: Northern Ireland NHS chiefs call on private hospitals to provide helpHealth bosses in Northern Ireland have appealed to private hospitals to help them in the fight to save lives during the coronavirus crisis.CoronavirusCoronavirus: Calls to get tougher on social distancing after second death in Northern IrelandPressure is mounting for stronger legislation to enforce social distancing as a second person died in Northern Ireland after contracting Covid-.VideoCoronavirusCoronavirus: Social distancing plea by boy with cancer as he bids to avoid infectionStay at home - don#t send me back to intensive care.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadMan who died after Co Antrim stabbing named Coronavirus updates: #Everyone at risk# warns Swann with UK lockdown #imminent#It#s love at a distance as well-known Northern Ireland faces mark a Mother#s Day like no otherCommunity in shock after death of motorcyclist Andrew BrowningCoronavirus: Keep your distance... a simple rule, but too many ignoring it,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The UCD QUB research paper, called #Symbols and Labels: children#s awareness of social categories in a ided society#, is published in the Journal of Community Psychology.Speaking to the Belfastlast night, lead researcher Dr Laura K Taylor said: How and when children develop an understanding of group boundaries has implications for conflict resolution.She hoped the research would inform education policy and teaching in Northern Ireland.Our research is trying to help understand what it means for children to grow up in a post-accord society. Children today did not grow up in a violent society, so how do they learn about it These findings suggest that, by late childhood, children in Northern Ireland can readily identy and associate symbols with their hypothesised social categories.Separate school systems, as well as strong family networks and homogeneous lestyles, shape children#s cultural awareness, the researchers suggest.The UCD QUB research echoes a  study for the Community Relations Council, which found children as young as three were able to recognise symbols as being linked to either loyalist or nationalist cultures.That earlier study - carried out by the University of Ulster - found that by the age of six, % of the more than three hundred children surveyed could identy flags and parades as belonging to one #side# or the other.

Stockpiles of Personal Protective Equipmentwere said to be making its way to frontline healthcare workers but those in retail appear to be the ‘forgotten frontline’. The Derry News has spoken to workers in dferent stores who have had to bring their own hand sanitisers or other protective equipment to work. PPE shortages are understood to be widespread across the health service and also include GP practices. The government has made clear that it is making efforts to deliver emergency supplies to hospitals. googletag.cmd.push However, retail workers who are serving thousands of customers every day in a pressurised environment as a consequence of panic-buying have been somewhat overlooked. They are on the frontline too, trade unionists say, and face daily abuse from angry customers upset over food shortages. The Derry News contacted the major supermarkets based in the city to ask what ‘specic measures’ they have put in place to protect staff. In response, Andrew Opie, Director of Food  Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents all the major supermarkets except for Tesco, said workers have been briefed on ‘strict hand washing’. “Retailers are continuing to adhere to high standards of hygiene, and all employees are fully briefed with measures including strict hand washing policies. This remains the best way of protecting staff and customers,” he explained. googletag.cmd.push When asked to expand on ‘specic measures’ being implemented, a spokesperson for the consortium said that some have drawn up ‘rotas to allow employees to wash their hands at regular intervals’. Meanwhile, Tesco gave assurances that the safety of its customers, colleagues and suppliers is its ‘number one priority’. Strict health and safety processes are said to be in place in its stores and its supply chain and the retail giant is directing all colleagues and suppliers to follow public health authority guidance on how to keep themselves, fellow colleagues and customers safe. Again, it could not say whether hand sanitisers, gloves, masks or other protective equipment would be provided to ensure staff are adequately protected. PROTECTION Derry Trades Union CouncilChairperson Niall McCarroll has called on all supermarket owners and management to provide workers with ‘adequate and fit for purpose’ PPE. He said COVID- will bring many challenges and changes to how we go about our daily working lives. “Some workers will be able to remain at home and shelter against the fast approaching virus. Signicant numbers won’t have the luxury of remaining at home. “Frontline workers is the term used to describe those of us who must face COVID-, keeping keep vital services operating, basically keeping people alive. “One group of frontline workers who are particularly at risk and largely forgotten are supermarket workers. “These workers need protected and above all  they need valued and respected by their employers. “Over recent years supermarket workers have suffered with their terms and conditions of employment being attacked and devalued. With company sick pay being hit hard through cuts from the bosses.” RESPECT DTUC has therefore called on the Retail Consortium to reverse all cuts to workers terms and conditions, by taking control and showing leadership at this time. Mr McCarroll said: “DTUC are calling for full sick pay to be paid to all supermarket workers who are self-isolating or caring for someone at risk. Full sick pay to be paid to all staff regardless ofof service. “For those workers who would be considered to be vulnerable to Coronavirus, those over , any worker with underlying health conditions and pregnant workers should be allowed to self-isolate and work from homethey wish. “These measures would be seen as in the public interest and widely supported. Frontline workers must come before profit.” He continued: “All supermarket workers must also have access to adequate and fit for purpose Personal Protective Equipment. Risk assessments, and widespread testing of all workers within this sector must be seen as a priority. “DTUC ask all members of the public to back the call for supermarket workers to be valued and protected. “Practice social distancing when in store and in the absence of respect from the bosses, show respect to these workers, without them things would be signicantly more dficult.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Stockpiles of Personal Protective Equipmentwere said to be making its way to frontline healthcare workers but those in retail appear to be the ‘forgotten frontline’. The Derry News has spoken to workers in dferent stores who have had to bring their own hand sanitisers or other protective equipment to work. PPE shortages are understood to be widespread across the health service and also include GP practices. The government has made clear that it is making efforts to deliver emergency supplies to hospitals. googletag.cmd.push However, retail workers who are serving thousands of customers every day in a pressurised environment as a consequence of panic-buying have been somewhat overlooked. They are on the frontline too, trade unionists say, and face daily abuse from angry customers upset over food shortages. The Derry News contacted the major supermarkets based in the city to ask what ‘specic measures’ they have put in place to protect staff. In response, Andrew Opie, Director of Food  Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents all the major supermarkets except for Tesco, said workers have been briefed on ‘strict hand washing’. “Retailers are continuing to adhere to high standards of hygiene, and all employees are fully briefed with measures including strict hand washing policies. This remains the best way of protecting staff and customers,” he explained. googletag.cmd.push When asked to expand on ‘specic measures’ being implemented, a spokesperson for the consortium said that some have drawn up ‘rotas to allow employees to wash their hands at regular intervals’. Meanwhile, Tesco gave assurances that the safety of its customers, colleagues and suppliers is its ‘number one priority’. Strict health and safety processes are said to be in place in its stores and its supply chain and the retail giant is directing all colleagues and suppliers to follow public health authority guidance on how to keep themselves, fellow colleagues and customers safe. Again, it could not say whether hand sanitisers, gloves, masks or other protective equipment would be provided to ensure staff are adequately protected. PROTECTION Derry Trades Union CouncilChairperson Niall McCarroll has called on all supermarket owners and management to provide workers with ‘adequate and fit for purpose’ PPE. He said COVID- will bring many challenges and changes to how we go about our daily working lives. “Some workers will be able to remain at home and shelter against the fast approaching virus. Signicant numbers won’t have the luxury of remaining at home. “Frontline workers is the term used to describe those of us who must face COVID-, keeping keep vital services operating, basically keeping people alive. “One group of frontline workers who are particularly at risk and largely forgotten are supermarket workers. “These workers need protected and above all  they need valued and respected by their employers. “Over recent years supermarket workers have suffered with their terms and conditions of employment being attacked and devalued. With company sick pay being hit hard through cuts from the bosses.” RESPECT DTUC has therefore called on the Retail Consortium to reverse all cuts to workers terms and conditions, by taking control and showing leadership at this time. Mr McCarroll said: “DTUC are calling for full sick pay to be paid to all supermarket workers who are self-isolating or caring for someone at risk. Full sick pay to be paid to all staff regardless ofof service. “For those workers who would be considered to be vulnerable to Coronavirus, those over , any worker with underlying health conditions and pregnant workers should be allowed to self-isolate and work from homethey wish. “These measures would be seen as in the public interest and widely supported. Frontline workers must come before profit.” He continued: “All supermarket workers must also have access to adequate and fit for purpose Personal Protective Equipment. Risk assessments, and widespread testing of all workers within this sector must be seen as a priority. “DTUC ask all members of the public to back the call for supermarket workers to be valued and protected. “Practice social distancing when in store and in the absence of respect from the bosses, show respect to these workers, without them things would be signicantly more dficult.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We are publishing extracts from the book. In this latest article, Brian examines what the local area was like in the Bronze Age.   One Autumn’s day in  a local farmer ploughing his hill-top field, overlooking the River Foyle, hooked a large flat stone, of dimensions  feet by  feet, and brought it to the surface.There it remained while the winter’s frosts worked to break up the soil.It was members of Shantallow Local History Society, out searching for flint fragments, the evidence of prehistoric settlement, who on coming across this large flat stone realised it was perhaps the capping stone of a Bronze Age grave.The Archaeological Branch of the Department of the Environment was called in, who, on one very wet March day in , carried out an emergency dig.Small village What they found convinced them that here in the townland of Shantallow, on the fringe of the present-day city of Derry, in the early years of the second millennium BC, lived a small village community of farmers who had trade connections with the flint-mining areas of County Antrim, and who in a nearby cemetery buried their dead.The stone which had lain undisturbed for some , years was, in fact, the capping stone of a cist tomb.Around , BC a circular pit,  to  feet deep, had been dug on the brow of a small hill,  feet above the River Foyle.In the middle of this pit slabs of stone had been laid on edge to create a stone box,  feet long by  feet wide.The corpse, with his or her knees folded up to its chest, had been placed in this coffin on its side.Rotted awayOnly part of the skull and part of the leg bone remained of this skeleton, as the rest of the body had rotted away through contact with the soil.Behind the neck of the corpse was an earthenware pot in the shape of a bowl and decorated with jagged imprints.This bowl had been made specically for the burial ceremony.It is clear that these people believed in some form of afterle, as the bowl would have been filled with food or drink to sustain the body after death in the journey through the underworld.The cist in which the corpse lay was then roofed with a capstone. In this case, as occurred on other sites, the grave wasn’t marked above the ground with a mound of earth.The farmer had inadvertently uncovered on this hill-top site a Bronze Age cemetery.Short cistThis distinctive form of burial, in a short cist with an upright bowl-shaped food vessel, is not unique to Ireland.It has been found all over Europe, even as far east as Russia. It represents the spread of the so-called Beaker peoples, named after their pottery, who originated in lands around the mouth of the Rhine, then spread to Northern Britain and from there to Ireland. Around the early years of the second millennium they had reached Shantallow.These people were settled pastoralists who introduced metal-working into Ireland.Near the cist in Shantallow fragments of flint, which is not a native rock of this area, were found, and the area of their greatest concentration marked the spot where a small community lived.Shantallow clearly supported a Bronze Age village.The flints were fashioned to be used as arrowheads and thumbscrapers.The arrowheads would have been used in hunting while the thumb-shaped flint scrapers would have been used in the preparation of animal skins before they were cured.Clothes would have been made from this leather.No metal artefacts were found, but in other cist burials hundreds of metal implements have been found.Ireland possessed abundant supplies of copper, and these people exploited in a large way Irish copper and gold, as evidenced by the metal axes, knives and daggers they left behind.Their most outstanding personal ornament was the sheet-gold lanula, a crescent-shaped neck ornament.The settlers at Shantallow were primarily livestock farmers.With their metal axes they would have begun to clear some of the surrounding forest to expose good pasture land. Here cattle were grazed for their beef.They would also have grown wheat, oats and barley, with the grain being ground on saddle-querns.Within an earth enclosure, perhaps topped with a palisade of timber stakes, the early inhabitants of Shantallow would have lived in small, single-room, circular wicker huts.Their houses were probably built of posts and wattle rods.Thin saplingsStrong posts were driven into the ground, and thin saplings of hazel, elm or ash were woven between them to form the walls. Then the walls were plastered with daub in which mud was mixed with straw.This mixture dried very hard to create a sturdy homestead.The roofs would have been thatched with straw or rushes obtained from marshy ground.Our early settlers at Shantallow would have only made a small impact on the forests which clothed this area.Only the hill top would have been cleared of wood.On a clear day, rising above the trees that swept down to the banks of the Foyle on both sides of the river, the early dwellers of Shantallow might have spotted, some two miles to the south-east across the river, smoke curling up from open hearths on Rough Island in Enagh Lough.FragmentsFinds of late Stone Age and Bronze Age pottery fragments on this island, lying almost in the middle of the lake, roughly circular in shape, with a diameter of  feet and now largely overgrown with trees and shrubs, identies this as a settlement site around the same time as the community of Shantallow were burying one of their members.This site on Enagh Lough, termed a crannog, was formed by a  of timber, overlain with a layer of packed stones almost  feet deep, being placed, timber by timber and stone by stone, on top of a marshy island created by glacial dumping during the last Ice Age.Bronze spearheads, flint flakes and abraded stones, worn away by man’s rubbing or scraping, attest to its settlement in prehistoric times.Around the edge of the crannog there may have been a defensive palisade of timber stakes with lighter branches of wattle woven in and out through them.Very similarThe houses inside, built of wicker, wattling and daub, and the lestyle would have been very similar to those at Shantallow.Barley, wheat and oat impressions found on the pottery fragments are evidence of the cultivation of these crops in fields around the shore of Enagh Lough.In addition to farming their own food, the inhabitants here exploited the fish and fowl associated with a small lake.No names or even exact dates can be identied against these Bronze Age settlers of the Derry area.But we do know that they did exist, and that they began man’s first tentative exploitation and alteration of the local environment. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We can still go out when we need to for groceries and the like, so there is no need to panic. Why not take the opportunity to binge on a few Netflix series . Our suggestions below arent necessarily suitable for younger viewers but will keep adults enthralled for sure. The Stranger Probably the top trending Netflix series so far this year and for good reason. Harlen Cobens latest creation shows a strange woman turn up in a British community to reveal the secrets of the inhabitants. The resultant human wrangling and mystery makes this one of those series where one more episode is never enough. The tying of those secrets together as the series unfolds reveals a lot more about the locals than they care to admit and uncovers a murky underbelly. This is a must-watch. googletag.cmd.push Marcella Anna Friel is exceptional in this Nordic-inspired British crime drama. She plays a run-ragged detective who finds herself central to the murder mysteries shes investigating. The edge-of-the-seat drama entailed in the unravelling of the story in each of the two stories is truly gripping. This is a well-acted and produced ITV drama that might have slipped under the radar for many. With two series and  episodes available on Netflix, there is plenty to binge on. Unforgotten Another ITV production starring the brilliant Nicola Walker. This series sees a team of detectives re-opening cold cases following the discovery of new information. They endeavour to reach back in time and across generations to dig up old evidence and connections. The result is another brilliantly gripping drama with a new story taking centre stage in each of the two series available on Netflix. It is fast-paced and written in a way that puts you in the investigation room, often shouting at the TV with nuggets of information youve spotted in previous episodes. A third series has aired but has not yet reached the streaming service. googletag.cmd.push Safe Another Harlen Coben creation which has seen an increase in traffic since the success of The Stranger, although Safe appeared on Netflix first last year. Coben specialises in writing a big story within the context of a small community and this is the ultimate example. A teenage girl goes missing from her home in a gated community, and her fathers desperate search brings him into a dark world. Suspicion falls on almost everyone and this series will have you second-guessing every word out of every characters mouth. The Trials Of Gabriel Fernandez This true-crime documentary is perhaps the most disturbing of these suggestions but is compelling viewing. It charts the story of nine-year-old Gabriel Fernandez and his gruesome death at the hands of his mother and her partner. The abuse he suffered sparks a wide-ranging investigation. That investigation and this series shines a light on something far more sinister and systematic than the abuse in Gabriels own home. It will make you feel very uneasy but you will not be able to stop watching, wide-eyed with shock.

Blade Runner A truly classic science fiction filmdirected byRidley Scott and starringHarrison Ford,Rutger HauerandSean Young.

GroundhogDay A brilliant  comedy where Bill Murray relives the same day over and over again.... Funny and fitting for the situation we find ourselves in. Jaws A classic and the music alone makes it worth watching. The Silence of the Lambs Not one for the kids.... and probably not one for some adults either. T Four Weddings and a Funeral A rom-com starring Hugh Grant and a theme song that launched a thousand first dances at weddings. googletag.cmd.push When Harry Met Sally Famous for THAT scene and a cracking comedy all round The Le of Brian Once banned in this country, it is still hilarious to this day and signs off with a tune fitting for the times we are in now.

The scoreline didnt do the Derry kingpins justice, Their tremendous determination and work-rate was enough to see them overwhelm Errigal Ciaran. The Tones never really let the Tyrone champions get a snf of glory. They trailed by - to - at half-time, but that scoreline disguised the fact that they dominated possession in the first half despite battling against a huge wind. The problem was they couldnt score. They hit seven wides to Errigals three in the first half, missed an open goal chance after  minutes, and failed to capitalise on the fact that they won nearly twice as many frees in the opening half. googletag.cmd.push In contrast, the Errigal Ciaran attack, with Eamon McCaffrey at full-forward and Chris Quinn filling the vacant spot at centre-forward, feasted well on the few crumbs of possession they received. As expected, Bellaghy dispatched David ONeill to mark the legendary Peter Canavan at corner-forward. He looked to have his hands full when, after five minutes, The Great fired over a trademark point to open the scoring. But thereafter, Canavan rarely got the better of the Derry county defender who completely dominated him in the air. ONeill received some brilliant support, particularly from corner-back and man of the match Peter Diamond and half-backs Cathal Diamond, Ciaran McNally and Kevin Doherty. googletag.cmd.push Errigal still looked dangerous up front, their scant possession yielding brilliant points from Eoin Gormleyand Peter Loughran. Bellaghy were left wonderingtheyd rue the Louis McPeake fumble which cost them a great goal chance in the opening quarter, after Fergal Doherty and Cathal Scullion had combined to create the opening. Seamus Birts timely introduction of Joe Cassidy greatly increased their powers of penetration. Errigal Ciaran werent helped when driving rain and dimming light, with a . throw-in and a lack of floodlights. The Bellaghy forwards got braver when the second half began. Three superb long-range frees in as many minutes from Gavin Diamond gave them the confidence they needed to capitalise on their possession. Points from Francis Glackin and Cassidy saw them surge three points clear by the th minute. And with key men like Karl Diamond funnelling back to defend in packs, they kept the Tyrone champions scoreless for  minutes of the second half until Mark Hartes consolation goal in injury time. The hammer blow came in the thminute, with Bellaghys goal. Cassidy and Gavin Diamond combined to put Cathal Scullion through, unmarked, to score the goal that ended their losing run in finals.

Just last week, the Judges Road club were preparing for their All-Ireland League game with Sundays Well, hoping for a win which would take them away from relegation uncertainty and into a potential play-off position near the top of Division C. But the worldwide events of the past few days have not only ended sport locally, nationally and beyond, it has also put any game into context, with peoples lives at risk because of the spread of the Covid- virus.Rather than sit around and wait for the latest news however, City of Derry Head Coach Paul OKane, his staff and his players have made a public offer to go out into the community to help in anyway needed. OKane himself has already been out delivering groceries and prescriptions to the most vulnerable unable to travel in a bid to keep them safe during these uncertain times. “Its just something that we thought we would like to do,” he explained. “I spoke with the president and I spoke with the vice-chair of rugby, and there have been plenty of the players who have stuck their hands up. Were all at a bit of a loose end now and we know that theres vulnerable people out there and to be honest theres been a very good response. “Its certainly opened my eyes to how vulnerable in particular the old people are, even for simple things such as getting their shopping done or getting their prescriptions done and weve been out and about getting a few things done today. I think its just important we try and do something.”The importance of sport to the local community has never been more evident than in recent days with most sporting events and clubs taking a necessary step backwards. Sport however, can still give back, according to OKane.“Were really an extended family when you see how far and wide it reaches and people maybe dont realise that sometimes because were so erse,” he continued. “Were here for the whole community, were cross community, were cross-border and we have people involved in the club travelling from everywhere. “Its just important to try and help anyone we can, eventheyre not attached to the club, eventheyre just a part of the city or wider area. “We have players from Inishowen, Letterkenny, Strabane and Limavady, and from both sides of the water in Derry itself. We have footprints on every side of the community here. This is the least we can do for the wider rugby family in the city and the city in general.”It could be weeks or even months before the sporting calendar resumes, but in the meantime, OKane is hoping that the crisis will bring out the best of our community.“Its not just rugby because Im a Derry City fan and I try to get to every game I can,” he said. “Im from a gaelic background as well. I helped coach Doire Colmcille and Im originally a Limavady Wolfhound, so its great to see all those wee communities trying to do their bit, and were a part of that. “Were at a bit of a loss at what we do at the minute so we have to try and make the best of it and help whoever needs help and try to rally around. From a sporting point of view, you dont know what you have until youve lost it. “Its crazy how much it affects us, evenits sitting watching sport or going training. Some of the guys are going out of their mind because they cant train. Its been massively impactful and when we get back at it, I think we will appreciate things a lot more.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

McCourt and his family made the decision to self isolate almost two weeks ago, after seeing how the spread of the coronavirus has affected other countries throughout the world, and he encouraged the people of his hometown city to heed the professional advice. “If you look at the consistency of all the reports, you can see that you can help everybody by doing the simple things like washing your hands, only going outyou have to go out, not socialising and not going for needless visits,” he said. “If youre helping an older relative or helping someone like a neighbour who cant get out for groceries, then thats fine, but dont just be calling to your mates house to play the Playstation or have a beer. “I think people really need to start listening to the advice were being given because its coming to a critical time. Whether its ignorance or not taking it seriously, over the next couple of weeks there will be no option but to take it seriously because I think its going to start getting serious here.” googletag.cmd.push LethalThe virus can be lethal to older people and those with underlying health conditions and McCourt urged the young people of the city to think about who they could come in contact with.“For young people who are fit and healthy its probably not going to affect them inidually but its who they can pass it onto is the worrying thing,” he continued. “Our club doctortold us that we probably could train and evenone of our lads contracted it, it probably wouldnt do much harm, but its about who he would then take it on and spread it to. That would be the worry so as a football club we decided not to. “I suppose were very lucky to have equipment to monitor the players from home. Seamus McCallion has managed to get all the players a GPS unit where they can still work out at home and they can download it and email it to him and then he reports back to us as a staff. In that respect theres a bit of trust there from staff to players, but on a wider issue, it is really important for people to listen to the advice they are being given on a daily basis. The majority of people are taking it seriously but there is an element, in my opinion, who arent taking it as seriously as they should be.” googletag.cmd.push EncouragementMcCourt has been involved in football for most of his le and whilst temptation to get outside may be there whilst the sun is shining, McCourt encouraged the young sports people of the city to act responsibly to look after their physical and mental health as well as others.“At the minute were still not in complete lock-down, we can still go out, you can still get a ball and knock it up against the wall and do keep-ups. You can go for walks thats the one thing Ive been doing every day,” he explained.“We go for a good long walk, all of us together, and when were out we pick up what we need and were back home. Were probably only out  minutes of the day but thats what we need to do for the foreseeable future. “Hopefully some day well look back on it and say these were crazy times and we got through them unscathed. It is a period of two or three months andyou keep the brain active and keep feeling safe, thats more important at the minute than sport.”McCourt caused something of a reaction on Twitter over the weekend when he stated that he would be getting back into football when this scare ended. The Derry Pele has claried his statement.“I think people picked that up wrong, in terms of trying to come back and playing, certainly not,” he laughed. “What I meant by that is that Im going to get back onto it, playing -a-side or -a-side once this all blows over. In the last  months since I retired, I went straight into that job at Derry, which was very, very time-consuming and still is. “When this does blow over Im definitely going to get back into some kind of playing, whether its just a mess about or playing amateur, because I do miss it now.“Over the last two weeks, weve all had loads and loads of time to think and I probably havent had that time to reflect since retiring because I was out of one job and into the next and it was full steam ahead with that. It will just be for fun and to keep active more than anything.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

McCourt and his family made the decision to self isolate almost two weeks ago, after seeing how the spread of the coronavirus has affected other countries throughout the world, and he encouraged the people of his hometown city to heed the professional advice. “If you look at the consistency of all the reports, you can see that you can help everybody by doing the simple things like washing your hands, only going outyou have to go out, not socialising and not going for needless visits,” he said. “If youre helping an older relative or helping someone like a neighbour who cant get out for groceries, then thats fine, but dont just be calling to your mates house to play the Playstation or have a beer. “I think people really need to start listening to the advice were being given because its coming to a critical time. Whether its ignorance or not taking it seriously, over the next couple of weeks there will be no option but to take it seriously because I think its going to start getting serious here.” googletag.cmd.push LethalThe virus can be lethal to older people and those with underlying health conditions and McCourt urged the young people of the city to think about who they could come in contact with.“For young people who are fit and healthy its probably not going to affect them inidually but its who they can pass it onto is the worrying thing,” he continued. “Our club doctortold us that we probably could train and evenone of our lads contracted it, it probably wouldnt do much harm, but its about who he would then take it on and spread it to. That would be the worry so as a football club we decided not to. “I suppose were very lucky to have equipment to monitor the players from home. Seamus McCallion has managed to get all the players a GPS unit where they can still work out at home and they can download it and email it to him and then he reports back to us as a staff. In that respect theres a bit of trust there from staff to players, but on a wider issue, it is really important for people to listen to the advice they are being given on a daily basis. The majority of people are taking it seriously but there is an element, in my opinion, who arent taking it as seriously as they should be.” googletag.cmd.push EncouragementMcCourt has been involved in football for most of his le and whilst temptation to get outside may be there whilst the sun is shining, McCourt encouraged the young sports people of the city to act responsibly to look after their physical and mental health as well as others.“At the minute were still not in complete lock-down, we can still go out, you can still get a ball and knock it up against the wall and do keep-ups. You can go for walks thats the one thing Ive been doing every day,” he explained.“We go for a good long walk, all of us together, and when were out we pick up what we need and were back home. Were probably only out  minutes of the day but thats what we need to do for the foreseeable future. “Hopefully some day well look back on it and say these were crazy times and we got through them unscathed. It is a period of two or three months andyou keep the brain active and keep feeling safe, thats more important at the minute than sport.”McCourt caused something of a reaction on Twitter over the weekend when he stated that he would be getting back into football when this scare ended. The Derry Pele has claried his statement.“I think people picked that up wrong, in terms of trying to come back and playing, certainly not,” he laughed. “What I meant by that is that Im going to get back onto it, playing -a-side or -a-side once this all blows over. In the last  months since I retired, I went straight into that job at Derry, which was very, very time-consuming and still is. “When this does blow over Im definitely going to get back into some kind of playing, whether its just a mess about or playing amateur, because I do miss it now.“Over the last two weeks, weve all had loads and loads of time to think and I probably havent had that time to reflect since retiring because I was out of one job and into the next and it was full steam ahead with that. It will just be for fun and to keep active more than anything.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only.

Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational. He also hopes that councillors will be provided with an estimate of the cost of the repair work.ldquoThis is Downpatrickrsquos only public cemetery and I hope that once the insurers have completed their assessment and the Fire and Rescue Service report is discussed, that repairs can get underway, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe cemetery is widely used by people from across the district and while the scale of the damage was signicant, it is somewhat comforting that the blaze is being blamed on an electrical fault and was not as the result of an arson attack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cheltenham.jpg","title":"Cheltenham joy  ","story":"THERE was local success at the Cheltenham Festival last week.Ravenhill, bred in Comber by Aaron Metcalfe, won the National Hunt Chase on the opening day of the Festival last Tuesday.The  year-old, ridden by leading amateur jockey Jamie Codd and trained by Gordon Elliott, romped home at  .

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our communities.Other councillors who spoke at Monday nightrsquos debate included Roisin Mulgrew, Michael Savage, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold

Fountain Foodbank has launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic.The cross-community facility mdash which has seen an upsurge in demand over recent days and handed out almost  food parcels last week mdash introduced the new service this week in the wake of Mondayrsquos advice from Prime Minister Boris Johnston that people should avoid all ldquonon essential contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott. Once on to the open mountain section, Lynch showed his climbing ability with a one minute lead at the summit before descending with devastating effect, leaving the opposition in his wake and an easy run home along the river bank.The rest of the field swapped places as everyone fought for grip on the steep mountain side.In the ladiesrsquo race it was Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson who dominated, showing many a good fell runner a clean pair of heels on the descent.At the end of the track back along the river it was Lynch, well in the lead taking his fourth win and third in a row in :, Scott held his position for second in : closely followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Adam Cunningham in :.Making the top ten for NAC were David Hicks in seventh place in : and Gary McEvoy ninth in :.

The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.This week, Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon confirmed that work to install the new street lights in Castlewellan will be carried out in two phases.Phase one starts next Monday and will continue until Thursday, April , while phase two is scheduled to start on Monday, April  and conclude on May .Ms Mallon said she has made clear her commitment to address the issues which matter most to the people of Northern Ireland.ldquoStreet lighting services are crucial in ensuring those driving, cycling and walking can do so safely within their communities, the minister continued.ldquoThis investment provides new LED technology along Castlewellan Main Street. It is important that adequate street lighting not only improves the quality of lighting but is more energy efficient given my commitment to climate action.The government department has confirmed that during work on the scheme, a traffic management system will be in operation between .am and pm and between pm and pm from Monday to Friday.Roads officials say that they have programmed the work operations and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but motorists are advised to expect some delays and to allow additional time when travelling in the area.And in order to help ensure the safety of road users and contractors, drivers are asked to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with extra care when travelling in the vicinity of the works.News of the Castlewellan investment has been welcomed by South Down MLA Emma Rogan and Slieve Croob councillors Roiacutesiacuten Howell and Hugh Gallagher.Ms Rogan said that the investment not only will provide the latest LED technology and improve the quality of lighting, but will also be much more energy efficient. She said ldquoquality and adequate street lighting in local towns is essential for businesses and traders as well as pedestrians and other road users.Cllr Howell said while the investment is welcome, there are areas across the district awaiting street light repairs and have been for many many months. She urged Ms Mallon to make these a priority and ensure adequate investment is put into maintenance of street lighting.ldquoCertain areas have had light outages for several months and local residents are feeling very vulnerable, she added.Cllr Gallagher said the Castlewellan investment will ldquomake a dference and said it underscores the SDLP commitment to regionally balanced infrastructure.He added: ldquoI am delighted that Minister Mallon has made Castlewellan an early priority. There will be somedisruption for the next few weeks as work gets underway but the Department has provided assurances that this will be managed as much as possible so that people can get where they need to go.Roads officials say that completion of the work in Castlewellan by May  will depend on the progress of the scheme and favourable weather conditions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Supermarkets.jpg","title":"Supermarkets deal with unprecedented demand  ","story":"AMID unprecedented scenes of shopping hysteria throughout the district supermarkets have been struggling to keep stock of basic supplies.A member of staff in one major store said it was ldquolike Christmas all over again.One supermarket staff member said he had filled the shelves to capacity with toilet rolls three times by lunchtime.He said that he had been working in the store for almost  years and he had never witnessedessential supplies such as hand wipes, milk and tin foods fly off the shelves so fast.Another staff member said he was worried about the back stock running low because when that was gone, a more dficult situation could arise.Shopper Christine Toland said she is not panicking but remains worried that supermarkets may run out of essentials supplies.The Downpatrick mother said: ldquoMy mother and father in-law hope to fly over from Manchester this weekend for a visit and are worried they might come in contact with the virus.ldquoIrsquom very concerned that we may not have enough essential items for the duration of their stay.Christine added that both herself and her eight year-old daughter Cha are asthmatic andare worried this will only weaken their immune system.Meanwhile, a Downpatrick nurse said she is refusing to give into the widespread hysteria to buy more than she needs.Karen OrsquoReilly said: ldquoMy father is unable to get out so Irsquom picking up some things for him.

Yet, when the crisis lands on our collective doorstepsour reaction will probably be fairly similar to this from Alexander McCall Smith:‘The unexpected always happens in the way‘The unexpected has always occurred:Le after the coronavirus willto an even keel, evenit turns out to be a dferent keel : Press Eye Ltd \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...‘While we were doing something ,‘While we are thinking of altogether‘Dferent things – matters that events‘Then show to be every bit as unimportant‘As our human concerns so often are.’For me, aged  and part of that older generation which seems to be at greater risk from Covid-, my immediate reaction was, ‘I thought I would have had more time.’ We all take risks every day driving our car through rush-hour traffic, boarding a plane, climbing a mountain, taking part in some particularly physical sports, tripping over a kerbstone, falling from a ladder. There are also health risks a stroke, heart attack, diagnosis of a crippling disease, onset of cancer, dementia, paralysis.But to some extent all of those are calculated risks. We consider the evidence: yes, we could be killed in a car or plane crash, or break our spine in a rugby scrum. But the calculations are almost always in our favour and we take the risk. And in most circumstancessomething very bad happens, short of death, there is a health service and after-care service to help. But what happens when the calculations are no longer in your favour  What happens when the chances of something potentially le-threatening happening to you rise above % to as high as % – maybe even higher  What happens when you suddenly realise that tens of thousands of people will certainly die, with many thousands of others left with long-term heart and lung complications  What happens when your freedom of movement is restricted for months on end and you have to acknowledge that either you, a member of the family living in the house with you, or someone from your wider circle of family and friends is likely to die  It makes you think about le, doesn’t it  Makes you think about what really matters to you, too, doesn’t it I have accepted that I will probably get Covid- within the next few months: it sort of goes with the territory of being an older dad with young children . And having accepted that I’m likely to get it – as well as accepting that the odds of survival are not comfortably in my favour – I’ve also realised that too much of my le has been wasted in pfling arguments and petty political point-scoring. There were so many things I planned to do when I was , yet haven’t done. All the books I planned to write, but didn’t. All the adventures I’d planned in my head –and yet that’s where they stayed.Most of all, though, I think of Kerri and the children. The last  years have been the happiest of my le. I desperately, desperately hope to still be here when this crisis subsides – as all crises eventually do –only to spend more time with my children. The books, adventures and politics don’t, in the great scheme of things, seem to matter anymore. I’d push them all aside just to know I could be with Lilah, Indy, Megan and Kerrifor a few more years. All le ends, I know that. But, to be brutally honest, I’d be mighty pissed-off to be pushed off this mortal coil by a virionwhich measures just billionths of a metre across.The good news – much more important, of course, than my own personal hopes – is that most of us will survive. Le willto an even keel, evenit turns out to be a dferent keel. The next few months will teach us unexpected things about ourselves, not least of which is the frailty of our very existence and the recognition that something which isn’t even visible to the naked eye is, in terms of destructive power, potentially more dangerous than a war or nuclear bomb. It sees everyone and anyone as a potential target. And even when we get some sort of control over the present virus, there will be another one along at some point.One thing we’ll maybe learn from all of this is, that as a species, we survive together or not at all. I don’t actually mean that in a political sense – because there will always be dferences but it is now clear that certain battles require global responses and global cooperation. We seem to have been caught on the hop with Covid- and we must do our best to ensure we’re never caught on the hop again.

Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.’You may well have your eyes firmly fixed on the here and now, but Christ can bring peace abundantly in the midst of panic, he gts an eternal peace through his cross that will never been taken away from those who trust in him.

Let us all, rise to the local threat of transmission, with local obedience to those who are in authority over us in government and public health and local displays of love street by street, neighbour by neighbour to ensure no one is forgotten or neglected. Across generations, let us not begin to view each other with suspicion and fear but growing compassion and love throughout these stages of response.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Fear and uncertainty is widespread throughout this community,” she said.“There will be a long term impact on the mental and economic health of the citizens of this City and Borough but the measures we have enacted so far are within the scope of our organisation.”Members then heard from the Chief Executive, Roger Wilson who reminded elected representatives of their duties in a time of crisis.“We are Council, we are the form of government closest to its citizens and, as civic leaders, we need to lead our community through this,” he said.“We are not the only people who have a role in this but we need to make sure we are all pulling in the one direction.“Many people are scared and are looking for information. Speaking to many of you, I know that you are being inundated by people looking for help and I would seek members approval to make decisions quickly as things are moving at a very fast pace.“There willbe a big impact on our communities mental well being and health and that is a challenge we will all have to face. We need to accept that and find a way to support our community.”The motion to support Council’s ongoing approach to thecoronavirus situation was proposed by Councillor Paul Berry and seconded by Councillor Sam Nicholson.Speaking after the motion was passed Sinn Fein’s Catherine Nelson thanked Council staff and officials for their tireless work and implored Council to consider using its cash reserves to help the local community through this crisis.“The rule book goes out the window at a time like this,” she said on behalf of her party.“Big decisions will need to be made and time will be no friend of ours. We give the Chief Executive and senior management team our full support. We have trust and faith in you.“I would ask for an imaginative and exhaustive approach. We don’t have to try and reinvent the wheel but we should be mindful of the mental health of our citizens and think about what we can do to help them.“We should think of walks, the appropriate use of our open spaces, drive in cinemas and even the use of our reserve fund to help those in need.“We talk about saving the reserves for a rainy day, we will never get a rainier day than what we are about to experience.”Her sentiments were echoed by independent Councillor Paul Berry who also urged Council to do what it could to keep businesses informed.“I would request that the information is kept flowing daily,not hourly because the message from businesses is clear, very few of them have more than a very short space of time to go.“Urgent intervention is required as we speak.It is important we try and keep SMEs and large businesses up to date on a daily basis to encourage them to try and hang in there.”The Ulster Unionist Party’s Julie Flaherty also urged Council to unite for the good of the community.“This is a time when we need to come together like never before,” she said.“We need to maximise the community response. We also want to extend our thanks to the Chief Executive and senior officials. You have our full support and we will strive to keep people informed.“The impact of this will be felt in our communityfor a long time and the UUP, along with this council, will be at the forefront of this issue.”The Alliance Party’s Peter Lavery also outlined his party’s support for the Chief Executive and said now is the time to set aside political dferences in order to protect le.“We look forward to hearing how we can help support local businesses,” said Cllr Lavery.“Council will play a strong role in lobbying central government on behalf of our community and we all know this situation will get worse before it gets better.“We must do all we can to support our community.”Democratic Unionist Party colleagues, DarrynCausby and Steven Moutray also extendedtheir appreciation to the Chief Executive, senior management team and all Council staff for their efforts.“Thistsunami is sweeping across the world and it will have a negative effect on our businesses,” said Cllr Moutray.“We need to know what we can do to help them and we, as councillors, will ensure that everyone is made aware of the help on offer.”Cllr Causby commended Cllr Nelson for her suggestion on using Council funds.“I would like to say that the idea of a community fund already mentioned by Catherine Nelson is something we should look at going forward,” he said.“As we move forward in this very dficult environment, we will work as best we can to take the dficult decisionsand provide support to those who need it.”The SDLP’s Thomas O’Hanlon also thanked the Chief Executive and the senior managementteam but warned that bigger decisions would need to be made in the near future.“Our community face very dficult times, they are scared and frightened, just as we all are.None of us are medical experts but it is a civic leaders duty to be calm and measured and ensure we respond with compassion.“We will get through this. Roger, you have made timely decisions so far and you will have more to make but you have our support.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most
