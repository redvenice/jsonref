Photograph Nick BradshawDublin Airport opened additional security lanes earlier on Sunday morning in order to cope with an influx of passengers seeking to travel abroad over the Easter holiday period.The airport has come under pressure in recent weeks to meet demand, with many travellers reporting spending hours in security lanes, having to queue outside, and some missing flights due to delays in getting through security.DAA, the operator of the airport, attributed the challenges to a reduction in staff following the collapse of international travel during the Covid-19 pandemic.It also said some passengers were arriving “significantly earlier” than their departure time, which was adding to the queues.In a statement on its Twitter account on Sunday morning, Dublin Airport said passengers were adhering to its advice to not arrive more than three and a half hours before departure time.“We have a steady flow of passengers in T1 where security remains open 247 and in T2 as many passengers arrive in advance of this morning’s first wave of departures,” the statement said.“With extra security lanes open earlier today and our taskforce assisting operations, Dublin Airport is prepared for an extremely busy Easter holiday time. We sincerely thank passengers for heeding our advice to only arrive up to three and half hours ahead of their departure time.”It added: “We are currently managing the flow of passengers into the terminal as part of a carefully planned process with the aim of keeping passengers safe and ultimately making sure passengers make their flights on time. We have 10 security lanes open in T1 and queues are moving steadily.”Last week, DAA published a five point action plan to deal with the expected increase in passengers over the Easter period.Some of the short-term options to increase security staff numbers includes identifying former security screening staff who are now in different roles in the company, and temporarily re-assigning a number of Cork-based staff to Dublin.It is also in the process of hiring additional security staff, with 100 staff members having already been hired since the start of the year.Some 250 candidates were invited for interview this week, with almost 100 of those candidates to receive employment offers.“Bringing recruits into the operation had been delayed recently by the requirement for enhanced background checks for aviation workers which came into effect on January 1st this year. Thankfully, however, this logjam is now easing,” the DAA said.The company recently faced political backlash about the pay rates it was offering to prospective staff, which were in the €14-€21 per hour range.It also emerged that it was seeking security staff to be available for 40 hours per week, while they were only being guaranteed 20 hours’ work with a minimum weekly salary of €283.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"president highlights special role of neutral countries at unveiling of restored eire 6 sign","story":"A pair of Irish Air Corps PC9M planes have flown in formation over Howth Head to mark a ceremony where President Higgins officially unveilled the newly-restored Eire 6 wartime neutrality sign there. Video: Irish Air CorpsPresident Michael D Higgins officially unveils the newly restored Eire 6 wartime neutrality sign in Howth, Co Dublin. File photograph: Nick BradshawThe Wars have been a catastrophe for every generation and the “rise of the bellicose language of militarism must end”, President Michael D Higgins has said. Speaking on Saturday at East Mountain in Howth, Co Dublin, where he formally unveiled the restored “Eire 6” sign, which he said proclaimed Irish neutrality in the second World War, Mr Higgins said: “I think there is a special role for people and countries who embrace neutrality to be active in making the case for diplomacy to the very end.”Referring to the war in Ukraine, Mr Higgins paid tribute to “the brave Ukrainian people who are struggling to defend their homes and their people”. He said it had been “unthinkable” to many “that Europe could find itself once again embroiled in war again in the 21st century”.The President said that “we must always exert all of our efforts to avoid war and armed conflict and we must relentlessly pursue a diplomatic approach and particularly involving the multilateral institutions, if we are to avoid bloodshed”. He told a crowd of several hundred, including Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien, TDs Richard Bruton and Seán Haughey, and actor Brendan Gleeson: “We must seize every glimmer of hope for diplomacy to demand and seek access to civilians in need.” Mr Higgins said that “these times are a time when diplomacy is tested”. Thanking the local Howth Eire 6 Restoration Group for restoring the Eire 6 sign carefully and in line with rules surrounding Howth Head’s “important” ecological protections , Mr Higgins said the sign would serve as a reminder to all of the wars in Europe. Noting the sign would be visible to aircraft landing in Dublin, he said it was “an act of positive neutrality” and served “as a reminder of the horrors of war, the unnecessary destruction and waste of human potential”. “So let us exert all our collective efforts to bring an end to war in the Ukraine so that we can return to living in a Europe and in a world that is free from war,” he said.Mr Higgins said Irish citizens valued peace and understood the “misery of war”. Navigational aidThe Eire 6 sign was one of 83 such signs, made up of stone, that were put in place around the State’s coast during the second World War to alert aircraft crews to the fact that they were in Irish airspace, the airspace of a neutral country. Also speaking at the ceremony on Saturday, historian Dr Michael Kennedy said the signs, being numbered, were of significant navigational aid to US planes coming across the Atlantic and of use to British planes heading for Northern Ireland. The Eire 6 sign had been located a few hundred yards from the Howth Look Out Post that was occupied during the second World War by members of the Defence Forces’ Coast Watching Service. However, the sign became overrun by vegetation following the second World War and was not rediscovered until a gorse fire in the early 1980s. Similar signs, including Eire 7 at Dalkey on the other side of the bay, have been uncovered and restored in recent years. After Mr Higgins’s address, the air force staged a flypast as a flotilla including the RNLI and Coast Guard tooted their horns.

Photograph: iStockThe managing director of a Wexford radio station has described as “staggering” a suggestion by Wexford County Council that it agree its presenters would not express personal opinions on air in return for the council taking out advertising on the station.The suggestion is one of a number made by the county secretary, David Minogue, in an email to the managing director of South East Radio, Eamonn Buttle, during discussions over a proposed €40,000-€50,000 spend this year by the council on advertising with the station.In January the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) issued a report in which it criticised Tom Enright, chief executive of Wexford County Council, for putting “unwarranted” pressure on South East Radio during a 2019 row about coverage of the council by the station, and in particular by one of its presenters, local businessman Karl Fitzpatrick.By threatening to withdraw council advertising from the station during the row, Sipo said, Enright had breached the provisions of the Local Government Act and failed to maintain proper standards of integrity.The public ethics body said Enright had wrongly conflated the issue of his dispute with the station over its coverage of the council, and the council’s commercial position as the station’s primary advertiser.The Sipo report was discussed by a special meeting of the council in January, during which councillors criticised the public ethics body before voting to take no action on foot of its report. The councillors then gave the county manager a standing ovation.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he did not agree, and that others would take note of Sipo’s findings. The findings would have “far-reaching impacts” on the future behaviour of councils.“There cannot be any attempts to influence the content of any local radio discussion, debate or its treatment or coverage of any issue,” he said.“Even if there are advertisements that emanate from the council and so on, that is not correct. It can never be used for that purpose by anybody. I am very clear about that.”Fresh rowHowever, a row centred on exactly the same topic has again developed between Wexford County Council and South East Radio, with the station this time objecting strongly to “criteria” that the county secretary, Minogue, suggested should be agreed by the station as part of a deal over a proposed spend of €40,000-€50,000 on radio advertisements this year.In an email sent to Buttle on March 25th, Minogue said the council “does not consider it appropriate that a South East Radio broadcaster offers personal viewpoints and opinions on South East Radio.“I ask for assurances that South East Radio will take the steps necessary to ensure such personal views and opinions are not offered by your broadcasters in the future.”The council executive also suggested that the station ensure that “raw” material, meaning recorded material not broadcast by the station, be kept for a period of two years.A third criterion suggested by Minogue concerned what would happen when the council sought a right of reply in relation to something that had been broadcast by the station.“I ask that the matter end there, and that the original theme or issue is not raised again on South East Radio, as has happened previously.”In his response on April 1st, Buttle described what was being suggested as “frankly speaking, staggering” and said it was “absolutely necessary” to remind Minogue, and the council, of some very important recent events.“I find it very strange indeed that it is necessary for me to do so, given the gravity of those events. But the content of your email is so utterly devoid of any insight or learning from the Sipo investigation that I feel I must spell out some fundamental facts.”It was remarkable, he said, that Minogue’s email set out to follow the same course as that followed by county manager Enright in 2019.Buttle quoted the comments made in the Dáil by the Taoiseach in February, saying Martin had made his position “abundantly clear in relation to the kind of influence and misuse of power which your email of March 25th seeks to exert”.‘Profound criticism’Despite the “profound criticism” that Sipo had made of Enright, and the fact that a separate complaint by the council about South East Radio to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland had been “rejected entirely”, the station had received no apology from the county manager or the council, Buttle said.He said he was forced to the conclusion that the criteria the council were seeking to impose were a “form of retaliation for, and a direct result of” the Sipo complaint that had been submitted by Fitzpatrick, and upheld in the Sipo report in January.Buttle said the regulator for radio stations was the Broadcasting Authority, and it was not appropriate for the council to seek to set itself up as a quasi-regulator.Minogue and the council appeared to “fundamentally misunderstand the role of a local authority vis a vis local (or indeed national) media in a democratic society”, Buttle said, before quoting from article 40.6 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of expression.The council, Buttle said, was seeking to restrict open debate and public discourse in relation to the activities of the local authority within which South East Radio operates.“In a democratic society, such behaviour cannot and must not be tolerated. South East Radio certainly will not stand for it.”‘Really disappointed’He said the broadcaster was reserving its position in relation to the county secretary’s email.Minogue told The  that he was “really disappointed” by Buttle’s response. He said he felt it was “not appropriate” given the “reasonable” requests that had been made to the station.The county secretary is the council’s Ethics Registrar for the purpose of complaints made about the council under the Local Government Act. He said he was not aware of any fresh complaints having been made against the council in relation to South East Radio.Buttle did not respond to a request for a comment. Following the council meeting in January, when councillors voted to take no action on foot of the Sipo report, Enright issued a statement in which he said “we intend to look to put a service level agreement in place with South East Radio to facilitate an improved relationship in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"australia prime minister sets general election for may 21st","story":"Austrlia’s prime minister Scott Morrison has called a a general election on May 21st. Photograph:Mick Tsika Australia and New Zealand Out Australia will hold a general election on May 21st, Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday, The announcement triggers a campaign expected to be fought over cost-of-living pressures, climate change and questions of trust and competence of the major parties.Mr Morrison played up economic uncertainties and security threats in announcing the election, saying this was not the time to hand the reins to an untested opposition Labour leader, Anthony Albanese. “Only by voting for the Liberals and Nationals at this election on May 21st can you ensure a strong economy for a stronger future,” Mr Morrison told reporters in the capital Canberra.The opposition Labour party says it would offer a better economic alternative for the Australian people.Mr Morrison’s conservative coalition trails Labour in opinion polls after nine years in power. But he similarly lagged before the previous election in May 2019, when he pulled off a win.In an opinion piece setting the stage for the election, Mr Morrison said despite the wide range of challenges Australians have faced since the last election – including fires, floods, and the Covid-19 pandemic – the country has held up much better than others.“But I know our country continues to face very real challenges and many families are doing it tough,” he said.He said Labour would weaken the country’s economy with higher taxes and deficits at a time when the country has led most others in recovering from the pandemic slump.“Now is not the time to risk that,” Mr Morrison said on Sunday.Labour leader Mr Albanese highlighted that food, fuel, child care and health care costs had jumped while wages had stayed flat since the conservative coalition took office in 2013, and said a Labour government would ease pressure on family budgets.“So when you cringe next time you pay your supermarket bill, remember it was the Morrison government that went out of its way to keep a lid on your pay packet,” Mr Albanese said in an opinion piece released on Saturday. –ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britain can inspire world make internet much safer children","story":"“Share your data if you’re looking for a wee stalker”. That is the response by a child from Edinburgh when asked about sharing too much personal information online.Others see content that promotes self-harm and suicidal thoughts without searching for it. Another is sent inappropriate adverts when playing online games.This is the backdrop to the introduction of our Children’s Code, a crucial piece of work to make sure that children can safely use online services.The code came into force in the UK last year and it is already prompting tech companies to make changes to better protect children.But we knew from the moment that we started drafting our code that its value in keeping children safe would depend on how the code was received internationally.The digital world is borderless, and so many of the online services children access are based outside of the UK. That is one of the reasons why I’m heading to Washington this week for the biggest international gathering to help protect people’s personal information.The more other countries require companies to protect children’s data, the more children in the UK are protected.And the UK has an opportunity to influence real change based on the world-leading code that we have developed.We’ve seen rapid changes in how British children are protected online following the expectations set in our code.Targeted and personalised adverts are being blocked for children children’s accounts set to private by default, plus location history turned off by default. Games and video streaming have geolocation unavailable or off by default. Social media platforms have security measures in place to reduce risks to children.These are some of the types of changes we want to see on a global scale.And there’s more to be done to assess the correct ages of children, give them privacy notices they understand, and to stop the creation of profiles using their personal data.In Washington, the Information Commissioner’s Office will be talking to social media companies in scope of the code and building relationships with the regulators, civil society voices and lawmakers that collectively push for them to do better.We’re calling for our code to be used as a worldwide model for regulation – to move beyond protecting children from the digital world, but instead to protect them within it by ensuring that online services are better designed with children in mind.Our Children’s Code can be the best practice, bringing benefits to children and businesses globally.We know that others are already taking notice. Two years ago, the Information Commissioner’s Office went to San Francisco, to speak with lawmakers, in order to encourage them to be inspired by our code.We are pleased to see that California is now looking to introduce a children’s code of its own – the California Age Appropriate Design Code bill has its first reading in the California Assembly on 19 April.

The plan is to give away a further 100,000 over the next 10 years.Among the rose varieties being featured in the campaign are the Chandos Beauty, Lady Marmalade, Sweet Syrie, Easy Does It and Raspberry Royale.David White, the managing director of Harkness Roses which is also supporting the campaign, said: “When I was a boy, roses were seen in public parks and gardens everywhere, but over the years their reputation has gone down as people think they are too difficult to grow and you have to go on a three-day pruning course to look after them.“But the new varieties are so easy to grow. Young gardeners don’t want to spend months tending their garden, they just want an instant garden that can be an outdoor room to their home and roses are ideal and great value. A typical plant costs £15 that will give 100 flowers a year for 15 years which works out at 1p a flower.“We want to galvanise all growers and breeders to revive the rose.”Chris Warner, of Warner’s Roses and Rose Society, added: “For too long roses have been perceived as a problem and this campaign is just what we need to inform people that roses have changed.“Old varieties requiring fungicide sprays gave roses a bad name. Now we need to show off our roses in railway stations, airports, everywhere so people can see the beauty, colour, drama and impact of roses.”More from NewsFrance goes to the polls as race between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen tightensWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?French election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When will we know the results?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive full scale nato military force defend borders","story":"Nato is drawing up plans to deploy a permanent full-scale military force on its border in an effort to combat future Russian aggression following the invasion of Ukraine, the alliance’s secretary general has revealed.In an interview with The ­, Jens Stoltenberg said Nato was “in the midst of a very fundamental transformation” that will reflect “the long-term consequences” of Vladimir Putin’s actions.As part of a major “reset”, the relatively small “tripwire” presence on the alliance’s eastern flank will be replaced with sufficient forces to repel an attempted invasion of member states such as Estonia and Latvia. Options for the reset are being developed by Nato military commanders.The disclosure came as Boris Johnson made an unexpected visit to Kyiv to hold talks with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president. The Prime Minister used the visit, which was planned in secrecy, to announce that Britain was sending anti-ship missiles and 120 armoured vehicles in the latest batch of military assistance.On Saturday night, Mr Johnson said: “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.”In a joint television appearance with Mr Zelensky, he added: “I think that the Ukrainians have shown the courage of a lion, and you Volodymyr have given the roar of that lion. “Having been here in Kyiv for just a few hours, I have no doubt at all that an independent sovereign Ukraine will rise again thanks above all to the heroism, the courage of the people of Ukraine.”Only half a dozen Downing Street staff are understood to have known about Mr Johnson’s visit before the Ukrainian embassy tweeted a picture of the Prime Minister holding talks with Mr Zelensky – such was the level of secrecy adopted for security reasons.Mr Stoltenberg urged other countries to emulate Britain’s support for Ukraine, as he signalled agreement with Mr Zelensky’s view that nations such as Germany were making a false distinction between “defensive” weapons they were willing to supply to Kyiv, and “offensive” weapons that they see as a red line.He also revealed that the threat from China would be enshrined into Nato’s “strategic concept”, its formal strategy document, for the first time, as Beijing and Moscow appeared to be “working more and more closely together”.Amid pressure by some Conservative MPs and ministers for increased defence spending in the UK, Mr Stoltenberg said that he would “welcome” more military expenditure from Britain. But his focus was on ensuring other Nato allies met the alliance’s minimum requirement of 2 per cent expenditure as a share of their GDP.Setting out plans for the “reset” of Nato, Mr Stoltenberg pointed out that it now already had 40,000 troops under its direct command in the eastern part of the alliance – nearly 10 times the number it had a few months before the invasion. But he added: “What we see now is a new reality, a new normal for European security. Therefore, we have now asked our military commanders to provide options for what we call a reset, a longer-term adaptation of Nato. I expect that Nato leaders will make decisions on this when they meet in Madrid at the Nato summit in June.”Before Feb 24, Nato’s presence on its eastern border with Russia amounted to a so-called “tripwire” force, which was intended to signal the alliance’s intent to defend itself from an attack.In the event of an attack on countries such as Latvia and Estonia, which border Russia, reinforcements would have been called in from across the alliance. But now Nato is preparing to have a permanent presence on its eastern flank of a scale that could itself defend the alliance against a Russian attack. Last month Britain said it would double its troops in Eastern Europe and send a new deployment to Bulgaria, when Nato leaders agreed to further strengthen the alliance’s eastern flank against Russian aggression. But Mr Stoltenberg’s remarks reveal that the alliance is preparing to go further still.Appearing to reject the claim by some countries that “offensive” weapons should not be provided to Ukraine for fear of provoking Russia, Mr Stoltenberg said: “Everything Ukraine does with different types of weapons is defensive, it is about defending themselves against the atrocities, against the invasion, against a brutal use of military force against their own country.”As well as the additional military ­support for Ukraine, Mr Johnson said the UK would guarantee an additional $500 million (£385 million) in World Bank lending to the country, taking Britain’s total loan guarantee to $1 billion.More from NewsFrance goes to the polls as race between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen tightensWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?French election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When will we know the results?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"foreign countries should adopt british rules keep children safe","story":"Children will only be safe in a borderless digital world if other countries adopt the UK\u0027s children\u0027s code, the information watchdog has warned.John Edwards, the information commissioner, will use a global summit this week to urge international watchdogs and social media firms to adopt the code as a worldwide model for regulation.Setting out his vision exclusively in The  ahead of the summit, Mr Edwards said it was only through other countries toughening their laws that British children would be protected when they used online services based outside the UK.The code would place a legal duty of care on companies in whatever jurisdiction they operate to protect children online with default settings and safety measures designed to guarantee privacy.Firms failing to comply with the code would face heavy fines and blocks on their services. It would be modelled on internationally agreed data protection laws where financial penalties are generally set at four per cent of global turnover, equivalent to more than £3 billion for a firm such as Facebook.Mr Edwards said California, which hosts the HQs of some of the biggest tech firms in the world, was already introducing a UK-style children’s code, with the bill\u0027s first reading in the state’s assembly on April 19. The Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Canada and Australia are bringing in similar measures.“We’re calling for our code to be used as a worldwide model for regulation,” said Mr Edwards, who will set out his proposals at the International Association of Privacy Professionals summit in Washington.“We knew from the moment we started drafting our code that its value in keeping children safe would depend on how the code was received internationally.“The digital world is borderless, and so many of the online services children access are based outside of the UK. The more other countries require companies to protect children’s data, the more children in the UK are protected.“And the UK has an opportunity to influence real change based on the world-leading code we developed. We’ve seen rapid changes in how UK children are protected online following the expectations set in our code.“Targeted and personalised ads are being blocked for children children’s accounts set to private by default, plus location history turned off by default. Games and video streaming have geolocation unavailable or off by default.“Social media platforms have security measures in place to reduce risks to children. These are some of the types of changes we want to see on a global scale.“And there’s more to be done to assess the correct ages of children, give them privacy notices they understand, and stop the creating of profiles using their personal data.”The  has campaigned for the last three years for a statutory duty of care to protect children online.

All political parties now, quite rightly, champion equality. But as far back as 1882 Gladstone’s second administration passed the Married Women’s Property Act, undoing centuries of English common law and a husband controlling the assets of his wife. Now, 140 years later, so-called progressives are attacking the Chancellor for not playing the mid-Victorian paterfamilias, and keeping his wife’s finances under control.The absurdity of attacking Mr Sunak for how his wife, who is not even a British subject, manages her considerable wealth only emphasises the cowardice and stupidity of using her to undermine him: for it should be obvious that he had dug his own political grave quite deeply enough without his enemies weaponising her.Much is awry not just with British economic management, but with the presentation of economic policy, and the buck stops with him. He has helped other parties to challenge the Conservatives’ economic record. More pointedly, he has made it easy for those of his colleagues who wish to stop him from succeeding Boris Johnson to do so. It is seldom wise, if one has prime ministerial ambitions, to be the heir apparent, as any number of beached ex-cabinet ministers will confirm. Mr Sunak, sadly for him, has become the latest.It is not advisable to be Second Lord of the Treasury in an avowedly tax-cutting party at a time when the tax burden is at its highest since the days of Mr Attlee, when we had the Second World War to pay for. It is not good to preside over apparently uncontrollable public spending – pandemic or not – to the point where your colleague, the fraud minister, resigns because you are showing no inclination to tackle £4.3 billion of fraud against the Exchequer caused by Covid loan schemes: never mind £9 billion written off for useless personal protective equipment.But perhaps worst of all – and this seems to have become the main card to be played against the Chancellor – it appears not to be a good idea to be a very rich man with an even richer wife at a time when, it is reported, some people are feeling forced to choose between eating and turning their heating on, and you have just made many of them pay more National Insurance.Being extremely rich should not be a disqualification from holding high political office. However, the Chancellor’s public relations of late have been abominable, especially for one who was formerly so assiduous (perhaps too assiduous) at projecting an attractive public image. If he understands what life is really like for many whom he helps govern then he makes a poor show of communicating that fact. Notably, a photo opportunity he staged when cutting fuel duty last month served to suggest only his inexperience at filling a car up, leaving others to assume that he has a forelock-tugging man who does that for him.Mrs Sunak’s agreement to pay tax on her overseas earnings in Britain has been reported as a ploy to save her husband’s career. It is probably too late. The Prime Minister, having seen the failure of many ministerial colleagues and backbenchers to support Mr Sunak, may conclude that he could reshuffle him without much harm. With all the talk of the Sunaks’ global property portfolio, and of Mrs Sunak being richer than the Queen, Tory MPs are now openly saying he is too rich to be prime minister. Given what Labour calls “the cost of living crisis” and Mr Sunak’s tactlessness in managing his public image and his policies, they may, regrettably, be right.In a meritocratic party a leader should be chosen according to his or her abilities. Unfortunately for Mr Sunak, however, what has really undone him is that his talents are now being seriously called into question. His family’s fortune, compared with that failing, is a secondary matter.More from NewsFrance goes to the polls as race between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen tightensWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?French election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When will we know the results?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stuck macron le pen frances political system disintegrating","story":"Whatever the outcome of France’s presidential vote – and President Macron will probably be reelected – I fear it marks another stage in the dissolution of a political system. Of course, this could be beneficial: we are supposed to welcome change and renewal. It will certainly be interesting: France has often been a political laboratory for Europe, and its people are quite proud of this. But life in a laboratory is not comfortable.The familiar political landmarks that democratic systems depend on have gone. It is astonishing that the candidates of what were until recently modern France’s two ruling parties, the Socialists and (under a variety of names) the Gaullists, have been reduced to insignificance, with their presidential candidates polling at under 10 per cent. Yet France’s previous president was a Socialist, François Hollande, and the Gaullist François Fillon would probably have beaten Macron in 2017 had he not been caught up in a corruption scandal. Now these political pillars of the Fifth Republic system, parties that provided essential popular representation, have almost completely disintegrated. This election could be their coup de grace.Now France is faced solely with alternatives that repel or alarm a large part of its people: Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. Even at the last election, Macron was the first choice of only a quarter of the electorate. Then he seemed an unobjectionable centrist. Now he is regarded with visceral dislike by a remarkable range of people. Le Pen represents a far-Right tradition that until recently most voters considered beyond the pale: reactionary, racist, and undemocratic. But it has increased its appeal, especially among the young.Whoever becomes the next president will face a discontented and alienated country, and it is unclear how effective government can be possible. A President Le Pen would mean violence in the streets and political and economic crisis. Would she be capable of forming a credible government? Many of those voting for her are so discontented that they are willing to risk pulling the house down. But if he is re-elected Macron might also be faced with popular rebellion, and with a slim prospect of a parliamentary majority to support him.France’s predicament is an extreme form of the political malady rife across the democratic world: rejection of conventional politics, reduced party loyalty and membership, low turnout in elections, unpredictable and volatile voting choices. This has given politicians standing in opposition to “mainstream politics” – or claiming that they were – an opportunity in several countries.They are conventionally dismissed as “populists”. Le Pen of course is one of these. So is her far-Left equivalent, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. But Macron himself was the arch-populist, campaigning in 2017 against conventional politics, rejecting existing parties and creating his own movement drawn from civil society bodies and non-politicians. This respectable bourgeois populism has a label: “technopopulism”. It claims legitimacy from a superior ability to manage the system, in Macron’s case as would-be leader of a more powerful technocratic EU. His victory sounded the death knell of the old party system.Does this matter? Yes, if nothing replaces it which can perform the minimum functions of democratic parties: to assemble majorities, or at least large coherent minorities, to bring forward (and get rid of) political leaders, to formulate programmes and try to carry them out if elected, to give people a means of participating and being represented, and to maintain a sense of legitimacy. No system does this perfectly indeed, looking round the world we can see how poorly many democracies are working, including the most established. But in a system stuck between Macron and Le Pen, the problem is acute.Does history explain this? Clearly yes. Political systems are invariably created in times of crisis, and are very difficult to change thereafter. France’s present 1958 constitution, which its drafter aptly called a “republican monarchy”, was adopted to enable Charles de Gaulle to master the incipient civil war over Algeria, and to establish a powerful and even authoritarian government as the Fifth Republic.This was the latest variant of the regular fluctuations between authority and democracy that France has experienced since the 1789 revolution. The most recent had been the ultra-reactionary Vichy regime of Marshal Pétain (1940-44), followed by the ultra-parliamentary system of the Fourth Republic (1946-58), criticised as impotent and chaotic. De Gaulle’s system has been plausibly called Bonapartist, which is an attempt to combine both authority and democracy – “active authority, passive democracy”, as one historian has defined it.The Fifth Republic is paradoxical. It has been the most widely accepted and arguably the most successful of the 15 constitutional systems France has had since 1789. Yet it has always been criticised in principle, and has regularly given rise to problems. A cynic might say that it is principles that are France’s problem. Unlike Britain – which, said Disraeli, was not governed by principles but by parliament – the French have regularly chosen, or been forced, to try to design perfect systems. This, Edmund Burke thought, was the original sin of the Revolution, the “fairy land of philosophy”. De Gaulle’s republic deliberately weakened political parties and parliament by concentrating power in the presidency.After 64 years it has succeeded rather too well. Parties are largely the supporters’ clubs of iniduals, based on patronage and personal ties. Le Pen’s party, now called the Rassemblement National, is a 50-year-old family business. Macron started his own from scratch – La République en Marche (now simply EM! complete with exclamation mark). But then de Gaulle, the godfather of the system, also had his own tame party.The overriding aim of the party is to install a president, who is practically irremovable, and whose powers of government and patronage are immense. As a sceptical commentator, Jean-François Revel, wrote some years ago, this was an instrument so open to abuse that it was “criminal to put it even into the hands of a saint”. It was absolutism”, but “ineffective absolutism”. And indeed Macron’s high-handed plans for sweeping reform had to be watered down or dropped after the gilets jaunes revolted and workers came out on strike. But Macron remained. And is likely to remain for another term. To do what?The last two parties standing will be Macron’s EM! and Le Pen’s RN. Their changing and abbreviated titles show how little they exist apart from their leaders. The great mass parties that once bestrode French political life have almost vanished. Yet they possessed not only vast organisations, but whole cultures: there was a “peuple de gauche” with its own sociability, rituals and even tastes (the Left, one survey showed, preferred Camembert).But it is the far Right that is still alive and kicking. It too has its historic cultural core: a mixture of traditional Catholic patriotism, once royalist of French nationalism, resistant to Macron’s flamboyant Europeanism and of suspicion of immigrants. This attracted many former Communists, and now many young voters, embittered by poor job prospects and a system that seems unheeding.It is precisely this Right-wing tradition – long embodied by Jean-Marie Le Pen and tainted by anti-Semitism, anti-republicanism, Algérie Française nostalgia, and a lingering association with Pétainism – which made Le Pen father and daughter unelectable. Most French citizens, whether Socialist or Gaullist, would under no circumstances vote “lepeniste”.This political conundrum – a hard-core tradition that kept lepenism going despite all the reverses, but which at the same time made it unelectable – may be unravelling as the historical burden of the 1940s and 1950s is shrugged off by new generations. I still think that the weight of history means that Le Pen will be beaten even by Macron. But no longer by a landslide.  Then there is likely to be some sort of political turmoil that may bring new alliances and perhaps more ephemeral parties into existence. But the wish expressed by generations of French politicians since the early 19th century that France might develop a stable system of respectable moderate parties like the American and the British that could offer credible alternatives seems less than ever likely, not least because the Anglo-Saxon model is now uninspiring.So whoever becomes the next President, the likelihood is of a remote and unpopular incumbent, unable to unite the country, unable to carry out a programme, but solidly ensconced in the Elysée Palace. Whether Macron or Le Pen, the dangerous instrument will not be in the hands of a saint.  Robert Tombs is professor emeritus of French history at the University of CambridgeMore from NewsFrance goes to the polls as race between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen tightensWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?French election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When will we know the results?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"xi jinping dare not climb zero covid tiger","story":"Since late January 2020, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) finally admitted that the Covid-19 outbreak had become an epidemic and locked Wuhan down, it has bombarded the world with claims about the success of its draconian containment policy known as Zero Covid. These claims have been widely accepted at face value. Not only People’s Republic of China (PRC) officials but bien-pensant Western commentators decry demands for hard data about the origins of the virus and the realities behind the CCP’s response. The experiences of Chinese citizens have remained largely unheard.This wall of silence is beginning to crumble. For more than a month the PRC has been hit by wave after wave of omicron outbreaks. It is clear that Zero Covid cannot keep more transmissible strains of the virus under control. Public opinion in the widening areas of China once more in the grip of a brutal lockdown has turned against Zero Covid – most notably in Shanghai, where 26 million people are now subject to a grimmer lockdown regime than Wuhan endured two years ago.Xi Jinping continues to force hard lockdowns onto increasingly desperate Chinese citizens in the apparent belief that the health benefits will outweigh the serious economic and social risks. But is this questionable judgment the real reason for his unwillingness to take a different path? It’s worth revisiting the background to Xi’s identification with Zero Covid from its inception.Xi kept a low profile in the early days of Covid-19. But a CCP journal later quoted him describing an extraordinary meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee he summoned on 7 January 2020 at which he gave instructions on how to deal with the outbreak. But nothing was done to stop the virus spreading until a fortnight later, by which time millions of Spring Festival travellers had passed into or out of Wuhan, the centre of an epidemic which then spread across the world.Yet the CCP claims the 23 January lockdown largely confined Covid within Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei Province. Subsequent outbreaks have mainly been blamed on returning visitors infected overseas. China’s official Covid deathtoll now stands at 4,638. Around 95 per cent of this strangely low number of deaths reportedly took place in locked-down Wuhan and Hubei in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown. This questionable assertion underlies CCP claims that Zero Covid “succeeded”.Two years on, key engines of the PRC economy are grinding to a halt as cities and regions which generate a quarter of China’s GDP go into lockdown. Maintaining growth is crucial for the otherwise unaccountable regime to maintain social order, but prospects look bleak for the economy meeting even this year’s modest targets. In urban centres, dystopian repression imposed on millions of hungry and frightened middle class citizens is becoming intolerable. Less is known of conditions in more remote regions, but repressive zeal there tends to be manifested more brutally still.Xi hopes to extend his tenure as supreme leader of the CCP at its 20th Party Congress later this year. His explicit backing for Zero Covid seems to be influenced by his interest in claiming victory over the virus to support his ambitions at home and his struggle with democratic critics abroad. Those who seek to share in his dictatorship will not venture to derail Zero Covid now. Nor will Xi tolerate any exposure of its flaws.Xi seeks to outdo Mao as an undisputed Chinese dictator as in Mao’s case the greatest risks, if he succeeds, will be to the Chinese people. So far, he seems indifferent to their plight, and that for the present the Roman tag apparently fits: “Let them hate, as long as they fear”. But a Chinese proverb bears repeating too “if you ride a tiger, it’s hard to dismount”. Zero Covid is the tiger that Xi dares not climb off.More from NewsFrance goes to the polls as race between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen tightensWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?French election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When will we know the results?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela rayner tories blame frightening","story":"Tories are to blame for frightening cost of living crisis, not RussiaAngela Rayner, Labour deputy leader, has criticised the Governments decision to hike National Insurance at a time when families are already under strainRenewable energy sources are more self-reliant - but have been too neglected by the Tories, says Angela Rayner Image: Martin Burton SussexLiveopinionByAngela Rayner:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsThe Government’s introduction of a National Insurance hike at a time when families are already struggling to make ends meet is genuinely frightening. We are facing an extraordinary rise in the cost of food and fuel, which is affecting just about everybody – not just people who are on low incomes. To see this steep surge in prices has been devastating... and it’s only going to get worse. We have said time and time again that it is absolutely not the right time to be increasing National Insurance. And it goes directly against promises the Tories made to voters. They are trying to link the energy crisis to the war in Ukraine. But they knew the supply of oil and gas was a problem before. They have tried to blame the National Insurance hike on Covid. But  years of Tory austerity has made things even worse for the health and social care sector and put huge pressure on hospitals and the NHS.  The Tories have created this crisis and to break their promises when they knew this was coming just shows we cannot trust a word they say. They are so out of touch, they don’t even realise that this is the biggest cost-of-living crisis in generations. All the while, we learn that Rishi Sunak’s we uses a loophole scheme to avoid UK tax. I have had so many people contacting me who are absolutely petried that they are not going to be able to afford to live over the next few months. I grew up in poverty and saw the devastating effects this can have first-hand. The shocking thing now compared to when I was growing up, however, is that these are often people in decent jobs who are being forced to go to food banks in order to support themselves. So many of these people suffering, such as nurses and care workers, were told they were lockdown heroes  months ago. Now they feel like they’re being punished and are completely demoralised.  What’s particularly frustrating for me is that the North and the Midlands were promised so-called “levelling up”. But these are the places that are going to be the hardest hit by the crisis. People in constituencies like mine in Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester were promised their bills would go downwe left the European Union – but the opposite has happened. Labour would impose a windfall tax on gas and energy companies. We have done this in the past and we can do it again. There is no reason why we cannot pass this money on to the people who need it the most to ease the cost of living squeeze. This would reduce the average household energy bill by up to £, and we would target support to low earners, pensioners and squeezed families. We also need to ensure a more secure workforce, with a decent living wage and proper employment rights.  The PO scandal has shown us that anyone is vulnerablewe let this stand – and this Government cannot be trusted to step in and stand up for workers. We would also invest in renewable energy, like wind farms, to make us more self-reliant and more secure as a country. It would also bring in skilled workers to areas such as the North and Scotland, where people can get decent jobs to last them a letime. The Government’s response has been woeful and last week’s tax hike is only going to plunge more people into more devastation and debt.

That means anyone applying for a passport or renewal now will be unable to jet off for a Whitsun break next month. And they should not expect to receive a new passport until towards the end of June.The hold-ups are being blamed on a backlog of Covid applications as people are allowed to travel again and a shortage of passport workers because of the Ukraine War.An insider said: “Many of our staff have been seconded to deal with visas for Ukrainians. “Processing those is now our top priority so we can get as many as we can to safety.” The Passport Office deals with seven million applications during a normal year but that dropped to four million at the height of the pandemic when travel was banned.

The Chancellor this week branded scrutiny of we Akshata Murty’s non-dom status a “political hit job” and a bid to “smear” him. But Cleese said it was a normal part of democracy. He said: “I think it’s signicant the release of this information is seen by Sunak as a ‘hit job’, when some of us view it as a normal constitutional ­propriety. But maybe that’s a throwback to the days when we had a ing democracy.”In , Cleese revealed he was moving to Nevis, which has no ­personal income tax. But asked about its tax advantages in , he responded: “After  years of paying tax at the top rate, whether in the UK or the US, I feel that as I turn , I’m allowed to take a couple of years off.” Cleese explained he had moved to the ­volcanic paradise as it has ­“excellent race relations, a very well educated ­population” and “no sign of political correctness”.

Labour insiders say the party plans to triple spending on social media ads where clown Conservatives desperate to run away from their record use parliamentary resources to enflame ision. It comes as Boris Johnsonaposs backbenchers flood the opposition leaderaposs office with letters about the partyaposs stance on Trident, former Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, who now sits as as an independent, and trans rights.It marks a step-up in campaign tactics from Starmeraposs team and follows Wolverhampton South West Conservative MP Stuart Anderson writing a two-page letter to the Labour leader claiming frontbench MPs are anti-NATO and have links to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament - a protest group which last had prominence in the s and is not proscribed by any political party. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement confirmed Brits face the biggest fall in living standards since the time of rationing, with the Government offering almost no help for Brits facing soaring energy bills and towering inflation. A Labour source said: When people up and down the country arenapost using their heating because theyaposre afraid of the size of their energy bills, are avoiding using their car because the price of fuel has rocketed, and are cutting back on supermarket shops because out of control inflation has sent prices soaring, for Tory MPs to be using their publicly-funded resources on nonsense letters entirely detached from the reality of what their constituents need and want, shows how deeply out of touch this government is, and how desperate they are to run away from their record.  Labour is laser focused on tackling the cost of living crisis blighting peopleaposs lives.It is understood Mr Anderson will be targeted for an aggressive ad campaign after the letter claimed a number of Labour frontbenchers, including shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, may be members or supporters of CND and ly accused the Labour leader of being anti-NATO and maintaining links with CND himself.CNDaposs main aim is to campaign for the UK to scrap Trident, but it has made statements in recent days criticising NATO. It is not proscribed by political parties or considered a dangerous group by the police. Labour has branded the letter nonsense and has said any MPs who try to inflate fringe issues during the cost-of-living crisis will see attack ad spending in their area trebled. Another source said: “They want to talk about anything except the cost of living crisis, so we’ll bring the reality of it back to their constituency. “Anyone who signs these nonsense CCHQ letters will see attack spend in their constituency trebled. At a time they are putting up tax on every working family in the country, this clown is more concerned about a protest group that were last in the news when Jenner Rush was topping the charts. Labour underlined the party has a strongly pro-NATO stance and that a Labour government helped to found the defensive alliance. Mr Starmer forced  Labour MPs to perform a U-turn and remove their names from a Stop The Warletter criticised what it claimed was the eastward expansion of NATO.All  MPs removed their names and Mr Starmer has warned any MP or member drawing a  equivalence between NATO and Vladimir Putinaposs Russia will face expulsion.The Mirror has contacted Mr Anderson for comment.

However, Priti Patel is not issuing them with visas quickly enoughBoris Johnson has shown that Britain supports Ukrainian independence Image: POOL AFP via Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Apr |comments Although Boris Johnson had one eye on a great photo op on his surprise visit to Kyiv today, there is no doubting the genuine friendship between our PM and Volodymyr Zelensky.The Ukrainian president was certainly also grateful for Mr Johnson’s offer of extra British weaponry while there. On the international stage, Mr Johnson has shown Britain to be Ukraine’s staunchest ally, committed to Ukrainian independence and standing by the Ukrainian people in their hour of need. But that story is disturbingly dferent closer to home. What Ukrainian people fleeing war need most is sanctuary, and , big-hearted British families are ready to open their homes to provide it. Yet only , Ukrainian refugees have arrived here so far under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  That is because Priti Patel is not issuing them with visas quickly enough. The Home Secretary promised Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko she would ensure visas were processed in three days. That was three weeks ago. Ms Vasylenko is an impressive MP. And she is not impressed by Ms Patel’s dilly-dallying. In Kyiv today, Mr Johnson showed President Zelensky the firm hand of friendship. Now the PM needs to take a firm hand with Ms Patel – and tell her thatshe cannot sort out this mess, he will find someone who can.  Grant us a plan There was something depressingly inevitable about Brits who’d been looking forward to their first proper holiday for years spending much of it stuck in traffic jams and airport lounges. Today, chaos reigned on the ground and in the air as people tried to get away for a much-needed Easter break. The port of Dover blamed its delays on the suspension of PO Ferries. Airports said they were plagued by Covid staff absences. And Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wrung his hands and expressed concern, which was about as much use as a flat tyre on the M. PO bosses are to blame for some of this by their summary sacking of  seafarers. We must spare a thought for them and their families. But Mr Shapps knew PO would present a problem this weekend. And Covid should have come as no surprise to him. Labour says better planning could have alleviated some of these delays. And when it comes to travel, Mr Shapps is planner-in-chief. Tea infusiasts You have to be British to appreciate Sue and Keith Blayze’s passion for collecting teapots because where in the world, they would be dubbed crackpots. The couple have spent £, on their collection, which now attracts thousands of visitors a year and even earned royal approval when Prince Charles and Camilla popped in.

And he got the snap he wanted. A handshake and grin before getting back on the plane. Job done. Kind of. After all, that’s the optics sorted, PM, now it’s time for action. During his brief stay Mr Johnson pledged, as is his wont, everything that Ukraine needs to survive as a sovereign nation. And he’s promised missiles, rockets, armoured vehicles and new anti-ship weapons systems. That’s a start – these weapons are much needed. They are up against one of the world’s largest and most ruthless armies.  But the battlefield is not the only place where the PM needs to deliver. He also promised visas. He promised that the UK would make the process as easy as possible for desperate refugees. That’s a promise he’s failed to deliver. More accurately, his Home Secretary has failed. Lesia Vasylenko, a Ukrainian MP who took up arms against the Russians, said she was promised visas in three days by Priti Patel – three weeks ago. We’re used to this Government breaking promises. But to renege on a deal made to such desperate people is unforgivable. The joke in the Ukraine is that the visas will land when the war is over. Dark humour but frighteningly close to the bone. Mr Johnson needs to act with the same urgency on this as he did when he sped off to Kyiv. This is not a photo op, not a headline grabber, not an opportunity to spin. It’s about people’s lives. People we promised to help. Time to deliver.  Prove your honour Speaking of promises - it’s time for Prince Andrew to step up.

Removals vans were seen lining up to take furniture and personal items from the flat shared by Mr Sunak and we Akshata Murthy and move them to their newly-refurbished, luxury West London pad. A red velvet armchair, a shelving unit and several bags and boxes were loaded onto two trucks, which arrived at Downing Street’s back gate early on Saturday morning. But the Sunday Mirror understands the move was planned before Mr Sunak’s popularity noseed this week. The family are making the move because their eldest daughter is about to go into her final term of primary school, the Mirror understands. They want to be nearer to her school for the last few months before she goes to boarding school.  Mr Sunak is expected to split his evenings between the Downing Street flat and their Kensington home, but continue to work from Number .Previously a shoe-in to replace Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister, Mr Sunak’s fortunes have been on the wane since last month’s disastrous Spring Statement failed to provide help for families facing a cost of living crisis. This week it was revealed Mrs Murthy enjoyed non-dom tax status - and Mr Sunak had held on to his Green Card as a ‘resident’ of the United Sates for more than a year after becoming Chancellor. It comes amid calls for partners and spouses of ministers to be banned from being non-doms - and avoiding paying tax on money made outside the UK. Labour said Mr Sunak and his family potentially saved tens of millions of pounds in taxes through his weaposs non-dom status. And Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh blasted the chancellor for not being transparent about his family’s tax status. “He has come out on a number of occasions to try and muddy the waters around this and to obfuscate, she said. Mrs Murty announced on Friday that she would voluntarily pay UK taxes on all her worldwide income as she did not want her financial arrangements to be a distraction for her husband. But she will keep her non-dom status, which allows her to take advantage of India’s zero rate of inheritance tax on her family’s multi-million pound business empire. And the SNP called on Mr Sunak to publish his tax s.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the scandal showed the Chancellor and his we lived in a completely dferent universe in financial terms from ordinary people left struggling by the cost-of-living crisis. The Lib Dems have called on the PM to ban the wives and partners of ministers from using the non-dom “loophole”.

I tend to agree, having lived a semi-itinerant lestyle in the early part of my career.So, pity poor Rishi Sunak, who is shting furniture this weekend.I’m not entirely sure how useful he’ll be – given that he’s a short bloke . Maybe he’ll help pack a side table or two, chest of drawers maybe. But I can’t see him on the other end of a piano, ­especiallythey’re aiming to sht it upstairs.Stressful as relocation is, though, it will be the least of his worries this weekend. Pals are saying that, ­politically, he’s going through a bad time. The worst time, they say – and it’s going to get worse. Earlier this week, the Chancellor lashed out at the political storm around him. It was a hit-job, he said. No need to bring my we into it, he said, I haven’t done anything wrong, he said. Meh. I kind of agree with the first part. There’s a game going on in Westminster at the moment, trying to work out who has put the hex on Mr Sunak. To recap, he’s in some political ­trouble because it has emerged that his we, Akshata Murty, has, to put it mildly, a convoluted tax set-up. The point being, it’s not a massively good look for the Chancellor’s we to have been a non-dom when she’s quite clearly living here. In Downing Street. With the Chancellor. But, you know, I guess that’s just optics. Who’s behind it, how did this news leak out, everyone wants to know  Some people are pointing the finger of blame at Number . Mr Sunak has been billed as a future Prime Minister, a serious leadership rival, and this could well be “the ­machine” taking him out.  There are still some elements in there who are angry with the Chancellor for not backing the PM over Partygate. But that’s probably not right here. Nor is the rumour that the story was whipped up by Labour, although it has not done them any harm at all. In fact, as it rumbles on, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Mr Sunak is an electoral weak spot and a nice target to apply some pressure on. Open goal, really, a millionaire Chancellor married to a woman who had non-dom status, while the rest of us are skint. Open goal, and gives Labour some purchase in an area where they have been outclassed by the Tories over the past decade. Even at the height of austerity, the Tories still managed to frame Labour as weak on the economy. Not this time, not with an easy narrative, and an easy target like this. Anyway. It was probably neither of them. Just some fine journalism that sparked this whole thing. But it’s been seized on, naturally, and the level of mud-slinging will step up over the coming weeks. Mr Sunak is not happy, neither is his inner circle, andhe thinks Number  is behind the briefings, he’ll continue to lash out. Nothing to lose now, I suppose, as it looks like the Chancellor’s leadership hopes are over for now. Isn’t that the Tories all over  There’s already a war raging , miles away.

That is down by , since the , in the week ending  February . Rail services are battling Covid absences and a funding crisis - as there are still only % as many passengers travelling as pre-pandemic, the data shows. Passenger numbers have risen as fast as a million a week, hitting .million weekly journeys in the most recent figures. But this is down from .million weekly journeys pre-pandemic. And despite fares rising .% last month, services are still being cut to save cash. More cuts are planned in Yorkshire next month - leaving a two-hour, ten-minute gap between the .pm and .pm service from Leeds to Harrogate.  Labour, which obtained the leaked Rail Delivery Group data, blasted the figures just months after Tory ministers vowed to “protect and improve services” in the Integrated Rail Plan.Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “The Conservatives should come clean and admit they are taking the axe to vital rail services across the country. “This is the exact opposite of what the Conservatives promised, and will hit communities hard. “To add insult to injury, last month they clobbered passengers with another brutal fare hike.” The Rail Delivery Group said it was “only sensible” that services reflect the “new world” of passenger numbers that have “changed radically with the pandemic”, “so that the railway doesn’t take more than its fair share from the taxpayer”. Askedservices would ever get back to what they were in early , a spokesperson said: “Nothing is set in stone and we will continually monitor how passengersand look to step up services where there is enough demand from passengers.”  It comes days after local leaders said they were “shafted” by Boris Johnson’s bus funding which went to fewer than half of eligible areas. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The railways experienced an unprecedented fall in passenger numbers during the pandemic. “Not adjusting rail services would have been irresponsible and unfair on those taxpayers’ forced to foot the bill – many of whom do not use the railways. “Instead, this Government committed almost £bn to ensure vital services continued to run and key workers were able to keep using them. “Whilst passengers are ing, it is important to ensure service levels reflect demand, which is still % less than in , and we will keep working with operators to do so.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyDepartment for TransportBoris JohnsonRailwaysSave moneyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Coastal areas were already suffering hits as even low paid seasonal work dried up with so many holidaymakers jetting off to foreign hotspots instead. Local economies struggled even more as young people moved away to find jobs where. Now think tank the Centre for Progressive Policy has plotted the areas likely to suffer most from this year’s soaring prices. They pinpointed seaside resorts Thanet, Great Yarmouth, Hastings, Tendring, Essex, Torbay and the Isle of Wight - all held by Tory MPs - at particular risk.  Seaports Portsmouth, where one in three jobs are low paid, and Dover - hit by PO’s sudden sacking of  seafarers - are also on the poverty list.The CPP’s Ben Franklin said: “Our analysis suggests the Chancellor may be forced to reconsider a Universal Credit uplt to really help those hit hardest in places like Hartlepool and Hastings.”And shadow Levelling Up Secretary Lisa Nandy added: “This new research reveals the inadequacy of the Government’s response to the cost-of-living crisis facing families. “We need to get money back into people’s pockets.”The CPP used indicators such as existing fuel and food poverty, benefit claimant count, joblessness and low pay to come up with a cost of living vulnerability index. That showed that Thanet has more than one in five residents struggling with food bills, one in ten with fuel, a child poverty rate of % and % not working. A quarter of those in work in Great Yarmouth are on low pay while one in three children live in poverty. But South Thanet Tory MP Craig Mackinlay, which has Kent seaside resorts Broadstairs and Ramsgate in his constituency, was upbeat on the prospects for his patch.  He said: “Going to Spain is going to be a lot more expensive this year. “So tourism here could actually increase what with fuel costs, flight disruption and people getting more used to staycations during the pandemic.” And at least one seaside town has avoided going into decline as the holiday trade disappeared by ersying into other areas.

The successful candidates – who will receive almost five times the salary of the average council worker – are expected to “live, breathe and champion” the places they represent.

Lisa Nandy, Shadow Levelling Up Secretary, said: “It is vital these directors provide value for money for the taxpayer and understand the communities they are serving. “Levelling Up can’t be about rearranging the deckchairs or more bureaucracy – it’s about good jobs for everyone, money in people’s pockets, and empowering people to make the decisions that affect communities.”Harry Quilter-Pinner, director of the IPPR think-tank, warned against recruiting from the “old guard” oflocal politics and said the Government must instead “reach out to women, people of colour and people from working-class backgrounds”.A government spokesman said: “Directors will be working collaboratively with local leaders across all sectors to drive innovative proposals.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sunday MirrorLevelling Up Watch,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Manager Karen Noble is on a mission to make sure people are getting the support and benefits they need – and this is particularly important for older visitors, who might feel isolated. “It’s not just about organising activities they can get involved with: conversations might come out of that,” says Karen. “People will tell you what they’re struggling with and how you can support them. You might find out that they’ve been given an iPad but have no internet connection, or that they don’t feel safe because some kids have been throwing eggs in the streets. “We have a lot of older people who shouldbe receiving benefits but they’re not. So we want to get that message out to them. They’ll go ‘No, I’m alright’ because there is a bit of pride there – but we want to make sure they get everything they’re entitled to.”Karen is devoted to helping people in the local community because she knows what it’s like to struggle. As a young mum of two, she worked and had to battle to support her children. “I had to fight to make sure I got all the right benefits – and then people saw what I did and started coming to me for help,” says Karen.

Over the past month Karen has noticed more people than ever need help as fuel bills rise and the cost-of-living crisis bites. “The fuel hikes aren’t in line with people’s wages and benefits, so we’re helping as much as we can. But we don’t just want to stick a plaster over it. Do we need to get people into better-paid jobs  Do we need to upskill them ” she asks. “There are lots of reasons why people are struggling now. They might have lost their jobs or used up their savings during the Covid pandemic. Some people are on benefits – but we’ve got a lot of people who are working hard just to put food on the table.” The Pallion Action Group is just one of the projects that has received funding from Peopleaposs Health Trust with money raised through The Health Lottery, and every time you play you’re supporting local communities like these.

Trafficked into the UK, she was tasered and forced to have threesomes, gang bangs, and sleep with  men a night. “It was the most traumatic time of my le, she says. Her horric ordeal left her with addictions to drugs and sex after she was farmed around dferent cities as her home was turned into a drugs hub.Natalie, who is going under a dferent name, said she would be lucky to get two hours’ sleep a night and wouldn’t see a penny from her sex work that she carried out over  months in dferent cities across the UK, reports WalesOnline. I had tasers to me, she says, At the time I did not realise how bad it actually was. It was a gang who kidnapped me and held me captive. I was stuck in my bedroom with a lock on the door and they took over my house. I was not there for  months and it was like a drugs hub, I was not sure what was going on.”  A victim of child abuse had made her vulnerable and she says she was naive as to how the gang had operated, who had been operating in Wales for two decades, Natalie says. She adds: “I was taken to Liverpool, that was probably the scariest time. That was the first time I was tied up. If I had spoken out I would have been killed and I thought my daughter would have it, it was mad.” At the time, Natalie admits she was a cocaine addict which left her in their debt and under their control. She continues: “They had seen the amount of money I was spending on cocaine - I was a coke addict. I was buying coke off them. It’s how I became involved in all of it.. I was sold to the sex trade.... I needed someone to find me.” As she was trafficked across Britain she barely slept to keep up with the demands of her kidnappers. The horror of being raped and abused is one she was familiar with. “Sometimes I would have sex  or  times a day all day,” she says. “I would only have two hours’ sleep a day and not even that. Me and my associate would be made to do stuff together and made more money. I would have to have threesomes and gang bangs. It was terrying, especially the trauma.”  She adds: “I was there for  months, that was not just in that one city it was everywhere. It was not in one place. I was in Liverpool for six weeks, I was not allowed out, I was in a room. I think I went to the south of the country after that - it was not as bad. “Obviously, it’s bad but I didn’t have tasers to me - it wasn’t as damaging there. I was there .for about four months, it was a normal house. London and Liverpool was the scariest one. London was bad - it was worst than the city in the south. I was in London for about six months, all I would do is work. In the whole time I didn’t sleep in any way and I couldn’t really sleep. After I had been gone for four months I never thought anyone would find me. Natalie has since been able to turn her le around, but the emotional scars remain and she still lives in fear. It was only on herto Wales that the brutal reality of her existence was finally uncovered but it was a struggle to speak out and reveal what had happened to her. The challenge now is living with the fear the crime gang remain at large. Natalie, now , said she was worried she would be discovered. “They didn’t jail them they are still out there,” she says. “They have been arrested but no jail sentence has been given for it. I get scared they may find me, I am petried. Now I just feelthey wanted to find me they probably would. I think I have moved on even to do with sex work, all that has all stopped. It’s because I had a sex addiction and I have seen love as through sex. aposFor me to be proud of myself is a thingapos Her le since her abduction has not been easy. She has endured spells of homelessness and drug abuse and found it dficult to maintain relationships. She ed to sex work on the streets when she did not know what  to do, although she says she has not done sex work for two years now. She has had four children, none of whom are in her care. Yet she says she has beaten her addictions to cocaine and crack cocaine and now only smokes weed. Her addiction to sex has been tougher to break and is something she still wrestles with.Natalie says: “My sex addiction was hard to overcome, I was working with BAWSO [an organisation that provides emotional support to black minority ethnic and migrant victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence, human trafficking]- I had  sessions and four extra sessions so I had a total of  hours support to help me,” she says. “I had to retrain my brain.I was working with a support group and I ended up working with one of the workers. She helped me a lot with my sex addiction -I do not have sex for two weeks I am fine. It’s breaking the cycle of not wanting it all of the time. She says she is now focused on her children and has been through three years of intensive support thanks to Safer Wales, which offers support to those who are invisible in society and work to protect victims of sexual exploitation from danger. Without them the woman would not have been able to move on into a dferent le and have a roof over her head. Her plan is to build a brighter future for not just herself but others who have struggled through their teens. “My Safer Wales worker has been there for tears and laughter, she has been through my three-year journey,” she said. “For me to be proud of myself is a thing - I was never proud before, now I could not be happier. “Two weeks ago I was given my flat - it’s all guns going with all the decorating. I think of the now, I try to bury everything - I shouldn’t but I do. I want to go to uni and do health and social care and open a rehab from  to -year-olds, I want to help people who have gone through dficult times when they are going through adolescence and offer a better start in the care system.” Natalie adds: “If I had a better start in le I would not have got into a situation of drugs and the trafficking. I never thought I was going to survive - it was like my world had ended and I was a no one.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON ProstitutionCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And Brits have been united in their despair, reports NorthWalesLive. National Insurance, council tax, and food and fuel prices have all increased due to the crisis, and experts have warned that the spikes wonapost start slowing anytime soon. Those that use smart meters were all under the impression that this would help keep cost down and also under control, as it helps monitor the bills. Unfortunately, customers of British Gas have come out in their droves complaining about something fishy going on.Love was certainly not lost on aposThe British Gas complaints pageapos Facebook page. Have you been experiencing similar problems  Let us know at webnews@mirror Sharon Backhouse said: How the hell can BG charge me £ in  minutes when I have no heating on  Amy Evans warned: Keep a close eye on your accounts.

In response, Charlene Borsberry said: Told me I didnapost even apply for it but why am I surprised [after] they stole last yearaposs from me  Iaposve had  years of dealing with them constantly cutting us off or letting us down.

She posted: Finally spoke to BG re my Warm Home Discount. I was informed that everyone should receive their payments by th April. If nothing has been received by then, to call back  only then, can they make payment, directly to the meter...! Nicky Hitchcock was equally outraged about the apparent overcharging. She said: We were on a fixed tarf of £ per month, which ended in December.  They then put us up to £ per month and have now recommend we pay  PER MONTH, even though we’ve never been in debit!

Steve, from Huddersfield, said he and a group of men battled to save the girl, who had been travelling in the HGV, which had set on fire. Have you been affected by this story  Let us know at webnews@mirror The Good Samaritan described how, despite his best efforts, he was unable to free the lorryaposs -year-old driver. Instead, Steve held his hand and was not willing to leave his side as he succumbed to his injuries. Fighting back tears, he said: I tried my hardest and I feel like Iaposve failed the family because I couldnapost do more. I just really need his family to know that the last words he heard were that we saved his daughter and she was safe. I had hold of his hand and kept telling him I was sorry, right until his final moments.  After seeing the accident ahead, Steve said he ran down the slip road and set out to rescue those involved. He was joined by three other men who were attempting to force open the damaged door of the HGV involved and smashed the passenger window. Steve has decades of experience as a HGV technician, and directed the men to focus on freeing the teenager from the vehicle, while he turned his attention on the man in the driveraposs seat. They attempted to use a fire extinguisher to put out the flames but it was not holding them back. Steve held the manaposs hand as it became clear he was unable to be rescued.It reached a point where I told him that I had to go and he passed in a matter of seconds afterwards. He wasnapost suffering for a long time and we made sure to stay with him as long as possible. The only other option would have been to get in the cabin with him, but there was just so much fire and smoke. He continued: It wasnapost safe to do anything more and I had to think about my own family in that moment as well. Steve described the other rescuers as  out of  and true heroes. I can only hope the girl is doing okay, he added. A -year-old man, who was driving the car involved in the accident, also died in the crash on April . Steveaposs boss Oliver North picked him up from the hospital in the aftermath and said his work kit was completely charred and his face was still covered in soot. He said: Steve was coughing and choking, heaposd been on oxygen for two hours after the incident. We think he is an absolute hero and a truly unbelievable man. The thing is, Steve would never have usually been down that way as he is mainly based in Brighouse.He added that his firm is building ambulances for Ukraine, and Steve was driving parts down to its Goole factory.He is so passionate about saving lives that he wanted to get involved in the project in any way he could, thataposs just who he is, continued Oliver. It is no surprise that he didnapost hesitate to run down that slip road and do all he could to help those victims. Steve is set toto work on Monday at his own request but has been given a present by his colleagues.

Martin Lewis and his Money Saving Expertteam asked social media followers for their best tips to help people who are suffering amid the c ost-of-living crisis. The team has compiled the Cost of Living Survival Guide to help Brits weather the price hikes, Hull Live reports.Families are expected to feel the sting this month as energy bills and National Insurance are increased. Council tax, fuel prices and food are also going up, leading to more people feeling the pinch. Introducing his teamaposs tips, Martin Lewis wrote: For some there is sadly no route to cut expenditure below income that fix will need political intervention.  For others, we need a collective endeavour, to work together to take financial pressures off where we can. And that is partly behind this guide. He explained the team had received thousands of replies from people with clever ideas about how to cut household expenditure. Martin described the response - which included more than , replies to his tweet alone - as overwhelming and uplting. One of the tips was to invest in a slow cooker to batch cook meals for all the family. They are available from Asda for as little as £. The Money Saving Expert team said batch cooking creates less food waste and reduces the likelihood of spending extra cash on takeaways.  One follower said they are apossaving a fortuneapos by using theirs more and more. Sharron Quaile wrote: A chef was on TV recently telling us all to get a slow cooker, as it costs p to cook a meal overnight. Made a cracking chilli the other night, gave my neighbour a portionand thereaposs one portion in the freezer. A user under the name of Living in Hope wrote: Iaposm using my slow cooker more and more these days to batch cook delicious soups, curries, stews etc then I freeze it in recycled takeaway containers. Saves a fortune all round. They added it did not cost much to invest in. It’s a standard sized one, only cost me about £ - very simple, no whistles or bells, but does the job, they wrote. The MSE guide also says that using a microwave is generally cheaper than an oven. It states a jacket potato would be more than  per cent cheaper to cook in the microwave rather than the oven.

Mick lost his job and then his home before ending up on the streets of London with his Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Benson, in . He told MyLondon : “Without him, I think I would have gone under.And he wouldn’t be able to survive without me, simply because of our bond. We’re together  . He understands me, I understand him. He’s the only thing I put my trust into and he’s never let me down.” But because of his beloved -year-old pooch, the Londoner has struggled for seven years to get housing. Their bond has only grown stronger over the years since Mick, who asked to only be called his first name, adopted Benson from his previous owner, who couldnapost take care of him anymore, at -months-old.  “How could I say no to him ” said the Londoner lovingly. “When he was three, I lost my job, then couldn’t afford my rent so lost my property, and ended up on the streets. I wrestled with my conscience over whether it was right to keep him - but he’s been through so much upheaval, I couldn’t not.”The duo appeared on the hit ITV show Paul OaposGrady: For the Love of Dogs and are known in their local area, around Liverpool Street and Hackney, with people like the shop owners, taxi drivers and station owners all keeping an eye on Benson.“I’m always conscious of him - that people might try and take him, said the -year-old, Rest and sleep is the hardest thing on the streets - you’re sleeping with one eye open.” He said: “Everything has to be centred around him and I have to worry about what’s going to happen to him. And then you can’t take him to certain services.”This includes many accommodation options for those who are experiencing homelessness. In fact, only around  percent of hostels in the UK are pet friendly, according toStreetVet , a charity working to increase this statistic and delivering free veterinary care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness around the country. According to StreetVet, to apply for housing benefits, some form of address is required. A hostel address is usually used for this, but as Mick said he struggles to get into hostels with Benson, he is unable to even get started with the benefits process. He also noted that many housing associations will not accept dogs. “You get accused of making yourself intentionally homeless so they don’t take any responsibility,” he said. “I’ve been trying to get housed for seven years. You get the choice between your room and your pet - that’s not a choice. They’re not acknowledging the support of Benson as important in my le, despite my health conditions.” Mick suffers with anxiety and depression, which he said contributed to losing his job. He believes he would have turned to drink and drugsit had not been for Benson. He said: “He’s my escape and gives me something to focus on. He’s a mainstay in my le and keeps me grounded. If he’s not around me, I feel lost - I feel secure when I’m with him. He’s not so much for protection as he is for comfort. You look at him and think, ‘It ain’t all bad - Iaposve got him. As long as I’ve got him, I’m okayapos. He added: “When you’re on the street, so many things can happen. If I start getting heated with someone, he can bring me back down. He reminds me that there are more important things. If anything would happen to me, then what would happen to him  If anything happened to him, then that would kill me, andanything happened to me then that would kill him - that’s it.” Mick claims that Bensonaposs role in apossaving his leapos has not been taken into consideration in his attempts to find a home for the both of them. Even during the pandemic, he claims he was not offered a room with his dog. He added: “I’d sooner take the risk on the street with my boy than be separated from him - simple. He also says knows some people have only just had their pets ed to them.He said: “The authorities didn’t grasp the bond between man and dog.” Founder of StreetVet Jade Statt explained that some places in the UK were better than others at housing owners with their pets - but the resounding feedback from her clients was that a poor effort was made in London. “They didn’t realise that people who have pets and are homeless are much less likely to engage in antisocial behaviour because that would end up in them being separated from their dog. You have a reason, a role, a responsibility,” said Jade. She added: “Because that dog was everything to them”. Summing up his dreams for the future, Mick said: “My dream is to have somewhere to call home - a self-contained property where me and Benson can live out our days.

Investigator John Mason said objects had spun around before falling to the ground. The tornado was confirmed as there was plenty of evidence of objects being airborne and spinning around the circulation before falling to the ground, he said.  He added that he believed it had a strength of between mph-mph. Deilwen Breese, owner of Gogarth Hall Farm, said she was away from the farm when she received a phone call telling her to come home. Ms Breese told the PA news agency she did not realise the scale of the damage until she got back. I thought it was just that part of the roof had gone, she said. But oh my god, when I came home I could not believe it. Ms Breese said she was still in shock from the incident. The devastation, it was heartbreaking, she said. I am still in shock, really. Ms Breese added: Trees had been lted from their roots. If they hadnapost been lted they had just been tarnished. We have lost hundreds of trees. The winds were so strong that a ewe and its lambs were lted into the air. Ms Breese said: It took a ewe out through the bay of a shed, and it picked up the little lambs. She said the lambs were fine, but the ewe was gone. Ms Breese said that the damage to the roof was about £,. When I got to the farm I could see the damage to the roof, itaposs about £, worth of damage on the roof. She said a group of  local volunteers were now helping her clear the devastation. However, Ms Breese feels that the farm will not be the same. She said: Itaposs going to take months, it will never get back, not in my letime. It will never come back to what it was.

Sixteen members of the Radford clan reached Florida despite previous worries of getting the brood through the long delays. Mum Sue and dad Noel successfully left their Morecambe home to jet off to a sunnier Florida where the kids can be seen having a blast as Disney World.Posting on Instagram Sue provided snippets of the journey including some brief shots in the airport, Lancashire Live reports.Clips show the kids running along the airport travellators, looking out at the window to the their plane and then finally, seated and on their way to the Easter holiday. But it wasnapost smooth sailing getting there. In a recent vlog, Sue spoke from the families home in Morecambe about the checklist of things needed to be done before getting on the plane. One of those tasks included getting a Covid test for everyone.  Speaking to fans in their aposmost tense vlog everapos, Sue explained that the day before they left for the airport they would have to take  Covid tests in appointment slots with an online witness. The four appointments included four family members at a time and just one negative test could write off the highly anticipated holiday for the entire family.

I did not sleep very well last night because obviouslysomeone is positive, we canapost go and weaposll have to rearrange it.I keep thinking it wonapost be the end of the worldwe do have to rearrange it, I think the situation with Manchester Airport at the minute is an absolute nightmare andIaposm honest, Iaposm not keen on doing that because I think itaposs taking two and a half, three hours, to get through security, checking-in as well is taking about an hour. Obviously when youaposve got sixteen of us, you can well double that, so probably about five hours for us by that time we probably would have missed our flight.  She continued: Iaposm not wanting to go through that, I must admit. So Iaposm thinking, it wonapost be the end of the worldone of us does test positive, we can just rearrange it for later in the year but obviously the kids will be absolutely devastated. But no signs of those fears affecting the trip were shown in the short but sweet video she posted. The only mention of the airport madness was in the comments as one person said: Oh Iaposm over the moon you are there and safe! The news is horrible re Manchester airport. Sue replied: It really is itaposs awful for all the staff on the frontline getting all the abuse.

Korynne @korynnecbegan feeling uncomfortable when she woke up from a nap on the beach, only to see a man sunbathing a close distance to her, leading her to worry he was stalking her. Convinced he was up to something sinister, the TikToker decided to get her own back at the man, by running past him and kicking sand in his face as she did so, the Daily Star reports. In a video she posted on TikTok, she said: When an old man parks himself -feet in front of your towel on a completely empty beach while you were napping and you know what needs to be done. Korynne filmed the beach to show the vast space with absolutely no visitors other than the man, before putting her phone down, turning on the selfie camera and running towards the sea. As she runs past the man, who is lying on his beach towel facing downwards, she purposely kicks the sand to the manaposs back.

In the video, Ukrainian troops are seen tracking an enemy armoured vehicle as it rolls across a field on the outskirts of the south-eastern coastal city of Mariupol.With a single strike, the vehicle appears to blow up and a large plume of dark smoke fills the air.The footage was shared by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Friday with the message: Azov in Mariupol continues to destroy the enemy.The regiment has gained a fearsome reputation for wiping out Russian armour.  According to Ukrainian reports, the Azov Regiment destroyed two other Russian tanks on April . The day before, Azov troops destroyed equipment of several Russian units and ammunition depots in the defence of Mariupol. The regiment also claimed to have eliminated many enemy infantry troops. Russian troops invaded Ukraine on February  in what the Kremlin is calling a special military operation. Today marks the th day of the invasion.  From February  to April , the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at an estimated , personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.The Ukrainian military also estimates that Russia has lost  tanks, , armoured combat vehicles,  artillery systems,  MLR systems,  anti-aircraft systems,  aircraft,  helicopters, , vehicles, seven vessels,  fuel tankers,  operational-tactical level UAVs,  units of special equipment and four mobile SRBM systems.The Azov Regiment, formerly known as the Azov Battalion and formally called as the Azov Special Operations Detachment, is a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine - the countryaposs national gendarmerie - and is based in Mariupol.  It is an all-volunteer infantry military unit and has an estimated  members. It has far-right origins and a minority of its members are still said to have far-right tendencies. In latest news, at least  people have been killed and dozens injured after rockets hit a train station in the city of Kramatorsk, in the Donbas region, eastern Ukraine, according to the countryaposs authorities. Donbas is where Russia is believed to be stepping up its offensive as it withdraws from the north of Ukraine. Parts of Donbas have been under pro-Russian separatist occupation since . The so-called Donetsk and Luhansk Peopleaposs Republics were recognised as independent states by Russia just days before the invasion was launched.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mozart to jazz trio ecossaise delight ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Arts Associationwas delighted to welcome Trio Ecossaise as guest performers at Ardrishaig Public Hall for the fourth concert of the season.The impact of Covid has meant that many planned concerts had to be cancelled or dates changed so it was wonderful to have Trio Ecossaise perform on March .The concert opened with the Kegelstatt Trio by Mozart. Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

The goal settled the Royal Burgh side, and Lewis Montgomery added a brace on  and  minutes.In Mowi South Division , Kilmory ran out - winners against a young Oban Celtic second team at sun-drenched MacRae Park, Lochgilphead.Goals from Sandy Leiper on  minutes and three by Alex Cunninghamsealed the points for the Kilmory.The home side enjoyed a good first half and would be disappointed with aof just two goals. Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage. It did not take long for Craig Speirs to gave the islanders the lead on six minutes, rling home from the angle.Two minutes later Inveraray were level, Neil Campbell showing scoring from  yards.Bute again took the lead in the th minute when Aray failed to clear and Aiden McGregor took advantage.The home side settled into the game after that setback and started to play some decent shinty, though, despite creating numerous chances, the sides went into half time with the score - to Bute.Inveraray started the second half the better of the two sides, giving the youthful Bute side problems settling.With Inveraray pressing it took until the th minute for the equaliser to arrive Neil Campbell again driving the ball home. Bute pressed to find a winner but the Inveraray backline held firm.In the Women#s Camanachd Association Mowi South Division , Dunadd Camanachd scored three goals in either half to defeat Uddingston - at St Ambrose High School in an excellent advert for women#s shinty # both teams fielding young players with a bright future ahead.Dunadd looked slightly nervy starting their first game of the season but a well-taken goal from Eilidh Cameron settled the team.The next  minutes were end-to-end but the Dunadd defence stayed strong with some excellent saves from stand-in goalie Laurene Cameron.At the other end  Eilidh E Cameronwas tenacious and set up Dunadd#s second as she slotted the ball to Rhian McCuaig, who finished superbly for her first goal for the club.Uddingston, though were not going to give up and, after a spell of pressure, Christie Robertson struck an excellent shot straight in the top corner.Dunadd didn#t let heads go down. After some excellent play on the wing, Alice Adair found striker Eilidh Cameron whose shot was judged to be kicked away by the goalie.Cameron didn#t hesitate from the spot and finished low to the goalie#s left.In the second half Dunadd#s experience started to show as they settled into the game.McCuaig completed her brace, Nicola Smyth finished from close in and Cameron went on to get her hat-trick.That winning feeling # Kilmory#s Sandy Leiper in their match against Oban Celtic juniors.

All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road.

Inside, an oak tile rests beneath the bottle, holding a plaque with the inidual bottle number, tasting notes and the single malt#s story.With an estimated retail price of £, per cl bottle, the release is set to draw attention from global collectors and whisky enthusiasts looking for a slice of Glen Scotia’s artistry in whisky-making.To mark its release, Glen Scotia has partnered with distinguished whisky writer Dave Broom to uncover the tale of this rare dram in a new short film, shot at the distillery’s dunnage with distillery manager and master distiller Iain McAlister.Mr Broom said: #It is intriguing to think this -year-old liquid was nominated to be kept back time and time again by ious hands, passing through the care of generations of dferent distillery managers until today.#Whisky is about understanding and managing change. This dram speaks of the past, but also of the future, and the respect which today#s custodians of Glen Scotia have for the whiskies in their care.#PIC:Whisky writer Dave Broom and Glen Scotia manager Iain McAlister.

First they compared all FFD before  with all those after that date.The results show that UK-wide the average flowering time has advanced by  days since , a finding that correlates with the rise in average temperatures in the meteorological records over the same time period*.The largest sht in FFD was  days, recorded in herbs , while a massive  day dference was recorded between wind-pollinated and the earlier flowering insect-pollinated herb species.Geographical dferences were also noted, with mean flowering time being six days earlier in the south than the north, five days earlier in urban than rural areas and one day earlier at lower than higher elevations.To date winter warming has exceeded temperature rises in other months, andit continues it will have implications for the alignment of biological requirements of ecosystem components.For example, early bud breaking and flowering increases the risk of frost damage and may also reduce the chances of pollination, both of which will decrease seed production.The scientists conclude thatthis trend continues then #the ing and productivity of biological, ecological and agricultural systems will be at an unprecedented risk#.* Buntgen U et al.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve.

to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.There is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website here.The Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours."},{"url":null,"title":"galaxy-smarties-see-easter-eggs-least-sugar","story":"Expressdentist was intrigued to find out which Easter eggs could be the best and worst for your teeth, based on sugar content, so it investigated to see what the worst for sugar content is, so you don’t need to avoid all sweet treats this Easter.Coming in the joint top spot for the Easter eggs worst for your teeth are Galaxy Ripple and Galaxy Minstrels Easter Eggs with g of sugar per g.Although two Mars Galaxy products take the top spot, the other two Mars Galaxy productsrank respectively th and nd.: I tried Aldis new Easter egg range - but which ones are worth buying In second place is the Smarties Easter Egg with .g of sugar per g.

Sure, but in the meantime, bring on the summer season totes and those Millport-sized kitchen islands.Imagine how history might have been dferentMargaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan had met each other earlier in their lives and married. [Pause for theatrical shudder.]According to the two-part documentary, Thatcher and Reagan: A Very Special Relationshipthe pair were as close as two friends in politics could be. There was no suggestion the relationship was closer than that, despite the tease of a title.Charles Moore, Mrs Thatcher’s authorised biographer, was the man in charge. He opened the film surrounded by some of Mrs T’s handbags, reminding viewers what it meant for a Cabinet Minister to be “handbagged” by her. Ronald Reagan did not have quite that fate, though she was not afraid to let him know when she was disappointed, as she was with America’s declared neutrality in the run-up to the Falklands conflict.Moore worked his contacts from his books and landed a few big fish as talking heads, some of them better known at the time than now, but offering valuable insights all the same. There was the personal touch, too, as he reminisced with Cynthia Crawford, “Crawfie”, Mrs Thatcher’s indispensable PA.Cruise missiles, Greenham Common, the Cold War, how long ago it all seemed, particularly with the news as it is now. The film suffered as a result, but there were a few nuggets worth sharing, and the insights into Reagan, adored his strong mother, alcoholic father, made a lot of sense.A busy time on the domestic front with a couple of shows ing and a newbie on the block. Anyone would think it was spring cleaning season.The idea is seductive – an organised le is the key to a happier, less stressful existence –not exactly deep. I can’t see home organising becoming one of the great religions of the world, but it is a harmless enough pastime.

Presented by Nick Grimshaw and Emma Willis, its USP was its ordinariness.Tech was used to show the rooms most used by a family, and the house rearranged and decluttered accordingly.No walls were knocked through or otherwise harmed in the making of this programme.

He used to wear a plain black belt and that one.”In short, Carol is surrounded by all the loved detritus gathered up over the years and given an added layer of meaning through time and grief. A secular reliquary for a le full of love and creativity.Memories caught in objects. She is even wearing one today. At her neck there is pinned a brooch with a photograph of her late husband Steven.Steven Campbell, artist, husband, father, dandy. This house – and the studio across the road – is where he raised his family and worked on his paintings for decades before his untimely death in , at the age of just .Campbell was one of the finest Scottish painters of the past  years. His installation On Form  Fiction which filled the Third Eye Galleryin Glasgow in  may be the most thrilling I’ve ever seen in Scotland. Emerging in the early s, Campbell was labelled one of the “New Glasgow Boys” alongside Peter Howson, Ken Currie and Adrian Wiszniewski . Now, nearly  years after his death, his work is seeing something of a renaissance, bolstered by the work of The Steven Campbell Trust, which his widow is a director of.In  Tramway mounted Steven Campbell: Love, an exhibition of  large-scale multimedia collages made by the artist between  and , and now fashion historian Mairi MacKenzie and fashion designer Beca Lipscombe have curated an online exhibition entitled Dressing Above Your Stationwhich attempts to reframe the artist’s work through his interest and love of clothing.As MacKenzie tells me, the term “New Glasgow boy” is not used anywhere in Dressing Above Your Station. “I think the best way to move on from something is not mention it,” she tells me as we sit down to soup and bread in Campbell’s kitchen.“It was a term that I can safely say Steven hated with a passion,” Carol explains. “The other guys probably hated it as well. It certainly didn’t serve Steven well because he always felt he came from a much more surrealist viewpoint.”How Glasgow was he anyway, she asks  “He was more of a suburbanite. He was from Rutherglen, out in the sticks. If you’re talking Glasgow, well, I’m Maryhill. I think Maryhill trumps Rutherglen any time.”The last occasion I came to this house was almost  years ago to talk to Campbell himself. Today his widow, MacKenzie and I spend a sun-dappled Friday afternoon in March discussing paintings, love, loss and memory. It feels like a privilege.The renewed interest towards her late husband’s work is thrilling to Carol. Dressing Above Your Station, she says, has also allowed her to step back and re-evaluate her husband’s work from a new perspective.It was only when she started working with MacKenzie and Lipscombe, she says, that she started to make the connections between what her husband wore and the clothing that the figures in his paintings are adorned in.The truth is Campbell the artist could have stepped out of one of his own canvases. “There’s an amazing photo in the exhibition of Steven with the family and he’s dressed like a warrior, his black beret on,” MacKenzie points out.“Dressed like Che Guea,” adds Carol.Steven with his daughter Greer on a family holiday in Tournus, France “And it just exemplies,” MacKenzie continues, “when your parents are a bit out there and you just think, ‘Oh my God, just what are they wearing that for ’”Carol smiles at a memory. When he used to pick the kids up from school, he’d arrive in his old Mercedes and his boilersuit and shout, “Campbells, come on down!” she recalls.“The kids said to me one time, ‘Mum, why can’t you pick us up from school ’ I said, ‘Mummy’s working, so daddy has to get you from school.’ And they said, ‘Why can’t he just be a Marks and Spencer daddy like everybody ’s daddy ’“He never let them forget that. And now they look back and say, thank God he wasn’t a Marks and Spencer daddy.”But what follows, for the most part, is Carol and Steven’s story.Photobooth photographs of Carol and Steven taken on the day of his interview for the Fulbright Scholarship Carol met Steven Campbell when she was , in , on a bus trip to Belgium. “My girlfriend booked to go on this coach trip to Ostend and it was all people of fties and over, because who at  goes on a coach trip ” Carol asks. “So, we got on the coach, and we see there are two young men on the coach this turns out to be Steven and his brother.“That was how we met. At the end of the holidays, he said would I like to go out in Glasgow to the pictures  We did the classic meet under the clock at Central Station and that was that.”Campbell wasn’t an artist then. He was an apprentice at British Steel. “If anything,” Carol says, “he thought he would be more political than artistic. He was a card-carrying member of the Communist party, but he became a bit disillusioned with that.“About that time his grandmother had given him a book to read about Toulouse-Lautrec. And he read this and said this is the most amazing story. And then it just spiralled. He kept buying books and then started really to enjoy art.“We both gave up our jobs. I gave up teaching, he gave up British Steel, and we took a tent, and we went off round Europe for six months and he decided when he came back that he was going to get some Highers at night school and put in a portfolio to the art school. He was accepted and I went back to teaching to keep us.”After graduating from the Glasgow School of Art, Campbell found almost instantaneous success. He won a Fulbright scholarship to study at the Pratt Institute and the couple decamped to New York in .“Everyone has special times in their le, and I guess our New York years were our really special time,” Carol suggests. “You get a period in your le when everything seems to come together.”They arrived in New York, found a room in the notorious Cha Hotel . They moved to the YMCA and then to a loft share between Soho and Little Italy. Campbell spent his time in the city painting continuously. Lady with Palette Hat and Hound, Portrait of Carol, by Steven Campbell Eventually, he rolled his canvases up, put them inside a carpet tube and walked around Soho from gallery to gallery and askthey would look at his paintings. Barbara Toll did just that and took a couple for a group show.“She phoned us once the show was hung to say John Russell [art critic] of the New York Times had been in and loved Steven’s work and was going to have it as part of the feature he was writing about emerging artists,” Carol recalls.“We went to The Algonquin for drinks and then we went downtown to Avenue of Americas because that was where the papers would land first. So, about two o’clock in the morning, the New York Times hits the streets. We get a copy and open it up and there’s Steven’s painting in this article by John Russell.“So, Steven then goes and buys a bunch of flowers for Barbara. We go to the gallery, shove them through the letterbox and by the time we went down to see her in the afternoon the paintings were all sold, and she said, ‘One man show.’ And that was it.”One of the paintings was sold for a Comme Des Garcons credit note worth thousands of dollars, MacKenzie notes. It’s why as part of the exhibition there’s a recreation of the Comme Des Garcons store on show at the MacLellan Works in Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow.The clothes the couple bought from the shop continued to be worn long after they had ed to live in Kippen, where they raised their three children Lauren, Greer and Rory and where Campbell used a garage as his studio. “I love the idea of something like Comme Des Garcons being worn in Kippen to bring up a family,” MacKenzie says, smiling. “It’s not the usual context you see it in.”New York was a launching pad for a career in art. But artistic reputations rise and fall over the years. There were good times and lean times. Carol ed to work as a teacher so they would have a steady income.“We had been thrty,” Carol says. “We knew as long as there was one salary coming in then he could have these exhibitions sporadically which would put a bit more back into the nest egg. And that’s when you’d have the extra treats.“He never verbalised it. You both know things aren’t going the way they used to. You don’t say that to your husband. And he didn’t say that to me. But you’re both aware.“But we were never worried about money because he had done so well. It must have been hard to tumble from the limelight, but, again, the work is his saviour. If he had been a shallower man, where fame and the money was the goal, then that could have been really traumatic. But that was never Steven’s goal.”For Campbell it was all about the work. And what strange, seductive, storied work. His paintings often seem to exist in some curious, often slightly creepy, Campbellworld of the imagination, one that mixed up flora and fauna and ghost stories and murder mysteries and literary and cinematic references.“They are thrilling, and they are mysterious and there is always space for the viewer to fill their own story within it,” MacKenzie suggests.The house we are sitting in is itself a small corner of Campbellworld. Carol is surrounded by her late husband’s work. Inevitably, perhaps, we end up talking about grief.“When it first happens it’s such a tsunami. That’s the only way I could describe it. It’s like being ill. You open your eyes and this memory floods in and your stomach just falls away and you think, ‘Another day’.“Joan Didion wrote a book called A Year of Magical Thinking and my first year without Steven was very much like that. I would be sitting here talking to people, but you’re not in your head …“That took a long time to go, and, in many ways, you don’t want it to go because each time that lessens you feel like you’re losing them.“I got so bad with panic attacks to the point where I was in my work, and they had to call an ambulance because I was just passing out with it. And it was a paramedic – because they tell it like it is – who said, ‘Listen you’ve got to get to a doctor, and you need some serious grief counselling because you can’t be calling us out every time you have a panic attack.’“I remember going along and the first thing I said to this woman when I went in was ‘I don’t want to lose my grief.’ I said I’ve not come here for you to put this away. This is all I have left now. My grief is all that I have of him. And as soon as I feel that’s gone that’s me lost everything. I don’t want it away. I want to be able to cope with it, to lead my le and not have panic attacks, but I don’t want the grief gone. I need to have it.’”Time passes. You can come to terms with grief . Artistic reputations may cool but then they can flare up again. With Dressing Above Your Station that seems to be happening for Steven Campbell. And deservedly so.More could happen. “I would like him to have a proper retrospective,” his widow says, “an acknowledgement from the National Gallery ,some place like that.”Even so, she loves the renewed attention for his work. “I just feel sorry he’s not here. It should be Stephen getting his picture taken him all excited in anticipation. I feel sorry that he doesn’t get that.”The day after we speak is Steven’s birthday. Carol tells me one final story about his funeral before I go.“I had bought a chain to wear to the funeral and it had this stupid big plastic heart on it and the girls said, ‘It’s a nice chain, mum. Just ditch the heart.’ So, I threw it in the bin. And we had thrown out his cigarette papers as well.“The day after his funeral I walked up to the top of the road and I closed my eyes and I kind of stood there saying, ‘Look, I can’t do this on my own, Steven. I really need a sign of some kind that you’re going to be there. I opened my eyes. I don’t knowI was expecting doves to flutter down or something. Nothing. Turned at the corner of the road. The bins had all been emptied. The only two things lying in the road were the heart and the cigarette papers and that’s always been my little sign.”Behind me the heart and the papers sit in the memory box. Small mementoes of a le full of love and art.Dressing Above Your Station is at dressingaboveyourstation  and runs until June . The exhibition is accompanied by a shop front projection at McLellan Works, in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow and a poster campaign across the city which runs until April Mairi MacKenzie on creating a virtual exhibition:What are you wanting to explore in Dressing Above Your Station Basically, the role of fashion and textiles in the le and work of Steven Campbell. We’ll look at it in the paintings, we’ll look at it in personal family photographs and we’ll look at it through the clothing collection that Stephen collected over the years.Beca and I saw a kindred spirit, I suppose, in Steven. We really understood that he understood clothes.”Why is this a virtual exhibition A few dferent reasons. One being it was lockdown. How do you display stuff under these circumstances  Secondly, accessibility. Not that many people are going to go and see a physical exhibition. Thirdly, you don’t have the same environmental footprint as you do with a physical exhibition. And finally, it was liberating just to be able to display things in a way that might not have been possible. Steven’s paintings are large. We are able to suspend them from wires in the middle of a room and that wouldn’t be possible in real le.And it was liberating in that we can tell a story in the way that we wanted. We can guide people around a virtual exhibition in a way that you might not be able to physically.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

He also appears to be unaware that policy and development of Scotlands rail network will continue to be the responsibility of Transport Scotland whose rail ision is led by Bill Reeve, an experienced railwayman and an eminent member of the engineering profession, who is highly esteemed throughout the UK and beyond. The recent electrication between Glasgow Central and Paisley Canal was widely acclaimed, having been delivered at a cost substantially less than similar projects where in the UK.Scotland is well rid of the Abellio management and Mr Macwhirters unsupported scepticism is unlikely to be borne out by events.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.MAKE ALL TRAINS AND BUSES FREEIT’S a pity that the tenor of Ian Macwhirter’s piece on the newly-nationalised rail services is predominantly negative before Holyrood does anything and I suspect this is just the start of an agenda that will eventually blame all the ails of our sub-standard rail network on those dammed Nats.Why is it referred to as “NatRail” and not “OurRail”  Eventhe present Holyrood executive is as gormless and ally inadequate as the previous providers of the service were, it will cost the general public less than it has been doing as no shareholders will be feasting on the dripping roast that privatisation of the rail services had handed them on a plate.As the reality is that one way or another the general public ultimately pay for everything, why not make all rail and bus transport free and paid for by the taxpayer  Make it a real public transport, do away with tickets and money altogether.I know from personal experience since I got my old-fogies free bus pass it has dramatically reduced my reliance on the car for short journeysI knew I could jump off and on any train I wanted to without a ticket I’d think about getting rid of the car altogether.David J Crawford, Glasgow.LET THE UNION RUN TRANSPORTI NOTE Iain Macwhirters article on the faith that the travelling public might, or might not, have in Scotlands rail service. With his comments on the power of the RMT union when it comes to pay and the provision of an efficient and effective service and the need for cabins on ferries, I wonderedthe answer would be to negotiate with the RMT on the basis that it be given total responsibility for the management and running of all rail and ferry services in Scotland.With such responsibility comes accountability and they just might acknowledge that they have a duty of care for the proper provision of transport and for paying passengers and goods. It would at least be beneficial to see them put their money where their mouth is. If over a period of time the RMT succeeded in managing our transport infrastructure, praise would be justied. If it failed it would then be found wanting and deserve the same fate as Abellio.Ian Gray, Croftamie.TIME TO END THIS FARES DISCREPANCYBEFORE the pandemic I used to travel monthly by train from Arbroath to Gourock to have lunch with old Clan Line shipmates. A dayusing my senior railcard and split ticketingcost around £, butI decided to stay overnight with my son in the Greenock area the fare was £. Occasionally I would drive and not once did my car stop on the Erskine Bridge and say “it’s Good Friday Christmas Eve or are you stopping over, because you will have to put another two gallons in the tank”. The distance was  miles  days of the year and that’s what you should pay for.We have not long had our hourly Aberdeen service restored, and the first time I used it I had tovia Edinburgh because a train broke down between Stirling and Dunblane, cancelling all trains north for several hours.No doubt ScotRail would say “ah well,you’re actually getting a bargain with £” but would you look at it like that  RET on Calmac suggests not.David Fyfe, Arbroath.BBC PURSUING ITS OWN RACE AGENDAIT was called Disclosure: The Truth About Scotland And Racism . A far more appropriate title would have been The BBC Take On Racism In Scotland.Ever since the ghastly death of George Floyd , the BBC has been following an agenda that England is a similar dystopian racist nightmare which few of us would recognise. It flies in the face of recent worldwide academic research stating England is a tolerant multi-cultural society.Clearly, the BBC, as with a criticised Panorama documentary in January , has decided Scotland will be treated in the same way. I would have expected a highly experienced broadcasterto have presented such a sensitive topic but we got young, Scottish, black, former model Jean Johansson. From the start of the documentary she admitted that she had been unaware of racism in Scotland yet, by the end, concluded that we were becoming much more racist, quite a jump in  minutes. As the we of former Rangers player Jonatan Johansson, it was surprising she struggled to name one of the many current black players in Scotland before settling on Chris Iwelumo,who hung up his boots in . One problem, which undermined her argument throughout, was her reliance on historic evidence. Cue the ghastly  coverage of bananas thrown at Mark Walters or solicitor Aamer Anwars abhorrent story of police abuse in . Similar stories in that period were all too commonplace.Surely the documentary should have focussed on the Scotland of today  In  there were , racial incidents reported to the police. The current figure is ,, a reduction of  per cent. Many pupils are taught Modern Studies where race relations, racism, prejudice, discrimination and stereotypes are covered. I would like to think education is having an effect in stamping out the cancer of racism. Certainly the Census of  showed that many of the top jobs in Scotland have many Scots of Chinese, Indian and Pakistani origin. Professor Nasar Meer was convinced that Scots of ethnic origin do suffer discrimination but do not report it. He offered no evidence.My greatest concern was the willingness of Mr Anwar to refer to the Sheku Bayoh case as more evidence of Police Scotland discrimination but this is still under investigation by the public inquiry of Lord Bracadale. Suffice to say PIRC investigated the case and the Lord Advocate brought no charges.Yet again the BBC has tarnished its historic reputation for impartiality.John V Lloyd, Inverkeithing, Fe.WHY NOT CHOOSE LIVING HERE NOVELIST and separatist mouthpiece Irvine Welsh has criticised the Scottish Tories for adapting words from Trainspotting as a device to highlight past and current SNP failings. Fair enough, I guess. But what does Welsh, from the comfort of his Miami sun-lounger, really have to contribute to any discussion about the reality of le in Scotland today  He hasnt lived in Scotland for many years . If he had, perhaps he could at least contribute to the debate in an informed manner, instead of hurling abuse at us from , miles away.Martin Redfern, Melrose.WEST CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE TOOI WATCHED a movie on Netflix the other night called Official Secrets. It tells the story of whistle-blower Katherine Gunns extraordinary effort to highlight the lies of George W Bush and Tony Blair in the lead-up to the Iraq war. She was an amazing lady and risked her freedom to expose the truth. It is particularly relevant at the moment during the Putin-led invasion of Ukraine.Both wars were are illegal, unprovoked acts of aggression, with enormous civilian death tolls involving the complete destruction of innocent countries. Putins Russia has been quite rightly severely sanctioned and hopefully Putin himself politically damaged and on his way out of power. After watching this movie, Messrs Bush and Blair were no better when it came to Iraq shame on them both. The so-called democrats of the West can be just as destructive when it suits them.Paul Morrison, Glasgow.WE SHOULD STOP FOREIGN AIDTHE latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says what the  countries in the world have to do to tackle climate change, but few are listening. Net Zero by  will cost every UK householder £, or £, every year. This for a meaningless . per cent of global emissions.Energy bills are £, and growing.

However, Holyrood and local authorities lack the powers to do this and Anas Sarwar wouldn’t even sign a joint-party letter demanding the devolution of these powers. Also, Labour voted against doubling the Scottish Child Payment to help hard-pressed families.Other than high energy costs, Brexit is the biggest cause of UK austerity and falling exports is causing real problems for our businesses, yet Sir Keir Starmer told LBC on Wednesday that “theres no case for rejoining the EU” and is in favour of the most expensive nuclear energy option which will add hundreds on to household bills for years to come. Scotland can’t afford UK Labour in power.As a leading energy-exporting country Scotland does not need nuclear power stations and should be focusing on the production of hydrogen fuel cells, the clean energy future for gas boilers, cars and ferries.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.* GROWING up in the s, we were informed that Scotland led the world with nuclear power. It was a nonsense of course. Scotland had and has no nuclear industry: we do not design, build or export our nuclear expertise.Nuclear power remains hugely expensive and dficult to build, needs guaranteed access to coolant at a time of increasingly serious climate events requires costly state intervention with subsidies, insurance and security. There is no long-term solution to waste. Scotland should utilise its share of funding to build expertise and an export industry around tidal power and green hydrogen.I actually heard a trade union rep complain that without nuclear power Scotland, as part of the UK grid, would partly rely on England’s gas-powered electricity generator. Was he really unaware that much of that gas originates in Scotland GR Weir, Ochiltree.* I HAVE been following the reaction to the UK Government’s decision to go nuclear and maintain its restrictions on onshore turbines.I wonder thoughyet again Westminster is missing yet another cheaper option.Why are we not placing bladeless turbines up and down our motorways and trunk roads  The turbines, while not quite as efficient as their bladed cousins, are cheaper to manufacture, install and maintain. Further, placing them along the roadways both avoids many planning constraints and provides another source of generation as well as the wind, ie passing vehicles. Just think, all those lampposts powered for free and the excess used to power service stations and homes nearby. Maybe even electric cars no, that would be an imaginative step too far.Perhaps before the A dialling finishes and any other major road project Holyrood might want to take the lead and plan for a bladeless contribution to our power needs.John Davidson, Carnoustie.TORIES RANCID PHILOSOPHYDR RM Morrishits the nail on the head when he characterises the Johnson Government as \"supremely competent\" in pursuing its own narrow interests rather than the interests of all its citizens. Thus the wealthy, oligarchic backers and Brexit-loving xenophobes are appeased by policies and promises that are entirely self-centred and devoid of empathy where the less well-off are concerned.This particular nail would have been obvious to many for some considerable time, but clearly not enough, as the results of the last election show us. Voters should ponder long and hard whether they wish to continue to collude with such a rancid philosophy.Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.WE MUST CHANGE THE TAX LAWSAS wein the press re the UK Chancellor’s we avoiding tax , I wonder when we are going to tackle the real issue.The social group that benefits from the current tax laws is the same group that made the tax laws and the business laws that – while intended initially to encourage investment – now just protect business people from the very market forces they are always banging on about. Ditto the same group that made the company laws that saw Sir Philip Green get away with asset-stripping British Home Stores and running up huge pension deficits while buying multi-million-pound yachts for his own pleasure.It was legal. Everyone knows it was wrong but the law protected him.Those same laws mean that those who benefit from government subsidy, post-privatisation of almost everything, are de facto living off massive social handouts – the very sort which is derided when givento poor people.Pinpointing the vile iniduals who have accumulated so much of the world’s wealth while people starve and suffer the effects of climate devastationis no longer a thing.The real thing is, laws need to be updated and made fit for purpose to reflect what actually happens in the st century.Amanda Baker, Edinburgh.WHATS FAIR IS FAIRAMID all the huffing and puffing about Rishi Sunaks Budget and wealth I spotted this on Twitter: \"This fair society thing. I know exactly what it is. Everyone richer than me can pay more in taxes. Preferably a windfall tax too for being richer than me. Everyone whose property is worth more than mine should pay punitive inheritance tax on their death. Everyone who owns a car bigger than mine should pay a much higher road tax. Then my taxes could be lowered and benefits through public services that I personally would use could be raised. That seems fair to me.\"Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.TV TREATS US LIKE CHILDRENI REMEMBER the Vietnam War but have no recollection of TV news reports from the time being prefaced with warnings about distressing content. I’m also pretty sure that in  the BBC didn’t preface Richard Dimbleby’s dispatches from Bergen-Bn with such advisories.Now, however, in the excellent coverage of the Ukraine war, we are endlessly told, as for example in Channel  News on Thursday, five times in  minutes, that \"this report contains distressing images\".We know that these images will be distressing, it’s war, we understand this, we do not need broadcasters treating us like children. For those who don’t want to see reality, they know where the \"off\" switch is.Stuart Neville, Clydebank.WE CANT DECIDE ON PEACENEIL Mackay describes reports of atrocities in Ukraine with Russia as the likely culprit . He writes that evenRussia withdraws from Ukraine \"there can be no peace until both Putin and his regime are destroyed\".So far Ukraine is the only country at war with Russia, not the UK. Commentators from our country cannot decide whether peace terms are acceptable to the countries at war.Allan Mackenzie, Cumbernauld.THE OTHER WH SMITHIAN McConnells article was not just interesting from a business perspective, but also from an educational one. Narrating the le and legacy of John Menzies and the business he founded was very informative.The mention of the takeover by WH Smith in the s reminded me of another WH Smith who has largely been forgotten by history. William Smith opened a foundry in Whitchurch, Shropshire, in  with three men  years later it had grown to a company which employed more than . His \"vision\" was to be able to \"make anything my neighbour might want\".I am not sure when the business closed, but I do know that there are still manholes and drains in Shropshire which bear his name and one of the easiest to find is in the village of Ironbridge near Telford. Behind the village store a drain cover is emblazoned with it.If any of your readers are in the vicinity of Ironbridge, they should go looking for it and be impressed by a piece of social history.I do realise, of course, that I am a bit of a saddo, butits a good enough hobby for Jeremy Corbyn then its good enough for me.Gordon Fisher, Stewarton.LITTER SOLUTION IN OUR OWN HANDSTHE letterfrom George Moore requesting an apology from Glasgow City Council for \"the filthy state of Glasgows litter-strewn pavements\" typies much of what is wrong with todays society. I was reminded of an occasion, years ago, waiting for a train on Queen Street Stations low level . A fellow passenger castigated a railway employee who emerged from an office that the litter-strewn  was a disgrace to which the employee replied : \"I didnt drop the litter there, madam.\"I am sure it is not Glasgow City Council which drops all the litter. A litter-free city, indeed country, lies in our own hands.Bob Byiers, Bearsden.AN OWN GOAL FROM SCOTRAILI AM going to Hampden Park on Tuesday evening to watch the Scotland Women’s National Team play Spain. On checking the train times from Mount Florida after the match, I discover that it is an hourly service. I shall therefore drive to the game, as I am sure many others will do.

For many people, the overall cost of living is simply too high, and incomes are not keeping up.This means having to make dficult choices between – for example – topping up their energy meter and buying that week’s shop.It is dficult decisions like these that culminate in people queuing outside foodbanks.This has been a common story for CAB clients for years.A snapshot of CAB debt management client’s budgets between April  and March  found that more than two in every five did not have enough income to cover their necessary monthly living costs.The maths simply did not add up. For these clients, decisions like the one described above are likely to have been a monthly occurrence.If you have filled your petrol tank recently, received your council tax bill, or submitted a meter reading, you might have noticed that prices are going up. is set to be defined by a very sharp increase in living costs. To top this off, many people have already experienced an income drop - from the £ cut to Universal Credit and end of furlough last Autumn to increases to National Insurance this spring.If the maths didn’t add up in  , things are not set to look any better in  .These factors combined will affect people’s ability to purchase food. Food poverty campaigner Jack Monroe recently demonstrated that current inflation has disproportionately affected low price foods, using the example of pasta in her local supermarket which rose from p to p over the course of a year.Under these metrics, the official estimates of .% inflation don’t come close to reflecting how price rises are actually hitting low income households.The same goes for energy. From the beginning of this month, energy bills will rise by over % -almost ten times the estimated rate of inflation. We are also concerned about housing costs.Social sector rents have been increasing more than twice as fast as inflation. And for some low-income households, private sector rents can be over half of their household income.So, to end the need for foodbanks long-term, we need to make sure that people have enough income to meet ALL their living costs.This means putting more money in people’s pockets and reducing the cost of living so that this money goes further.Our message to anyone worried about the cost of living is to get advice, and we’ll help however we can.However, we also need to see more action from the UK and Scottish Governments to address the rising cost of living. Otherwise foodbanks will be needed for a long time to come.Laura Toffolo is part of the policy team at Citizens Advice Scotland.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

Just looking at these images, at the waves thundering around sea stacks, the dizzying clfs, the dark sea caves, is an escape in itself.These are places of desire and longing. Evenwe never reach them, there’s an awe in knowing they exist. Caisteal Abhail, ArranA view from above, of Goatfell, the surrounding Corbetts and the rocky peak of Caisteal Abhail. Peter Irvine describes how Richard Cross captured this image by drone, after a climb from Glen Rosa to the summit of Caisteal Abhail, aka the Sleeping Warrior. \"The Corbetts here,\" he notes, \"Cìr Mhòr, Goatfell and Caisteal Abhail, together with Beinn Tarsuinn , can all be bagged in a twelve-mile ten-hour expedition. You’d want it to be a day like this one.\" Arran, of course, as Irvine observes, is one of the most accessible of the Scottish islands, but for wild, remoteness like this you have to put in a bit of work. Carsaig Arches, MullOne of Mull’s most striking natural phenomena, reached by a four-mile walk from the pier at Carsaig Bay, which is itself five miles off the main A in the southwest of the island. The route is tough and includes very rocky ground, strewn with boulders. \"Carved by erosion,\" Irvine writes, the arches are \"part of a volcanic landscape at times supernatural... As you reach the first arch at the end of the track, descending from the ridge, it looks like an opening into the sea, or ‘into another planet’. Other arches are like tunnels and there are sculpted pillars of basalt.\" Best to visit during low tides, when the arches themselves are more accessible, particularlyyou plan on walking further than the first arch. Fingals Cave, StaffaAn hours boat trip from Mull, on the tiny uninhabited island of Staffa, is a sea cave that has lured countless travellers since it was discovered in . Irvine writes, \"Sir Walter Scott wrote that ‘it exceeded in my mind every description I had ever heard of it’ and the -year-old boy wonder, Mendelssohn was so moved by it when he arrivedin  on the newly introduced paddle steamer service round Mull, that he was inspired to wrote his famed Hebrides Overture. The basalt columns, the huge arched entranceway and the cave’s dimensions –  m deep,  m high – leave a profound impression.\" Boat trips generally allow an hour or two of exploration, and some adventurous swimmers have even braved a dip there. National Geographic photographer Jim Richardson took this shot with added lighting effects, which bring its dark and dramatic architecture to le. The Mangarstadh Sea Stacks, LewisMany come to Uig for the breath-taking white beaches. But this area on the west coast of Lewis, washed by the wild Atlantic, is also an area of such rocky and elemental spectacle that it stirs the soul. \"The drama,\" writes Irvine, \"of the MangarstadhSea Stacks could not be further away from the gentle sandy strand of the same name, though they are only  km further on along the B...You might marvel at the grandeur of these timeless pinnacles, that they are so unknown, or just at the indomitable endurance of Lewisian gneiss.\" This photograph was taken by Michael Stirling-Aird, while on holiday. Irvine also advises that visitors be sure, on the way to visit the stacks, or after, to pop into the \"superlative seafood restaurant with the view to die for\", Uig Sands. Muckle Flugga, Unst A Sheiling, LewisThe sheilings of Lewis are iconic signs of a le that lingered longer here. Effectively summer bothies which were used by people who took their cattle out to the moors in order to preserve the pastures close to the villages for use in the winter months, they are the simplest of dwellings. Its their tin roofs that often stand out in the landscape and seem so distinctive. As Irvine puts it, Mhairi Laws \"photograph of an isolated house over the hill near Acha Mòr reminds us that the Old Ways are still part of the landscape of Lewis visible around the A, which cuts through the island’s heartland. They can seem to merge into the stony land. Sheilings are rough and ready, for animals rather than their keepers, though butter and curd cheese might have been made and shelter taken.\" Clfs of Yesnaby, Orkney\"The red clfs of Yesnaby,\" writes Irvine, \"are to Orkney what the white clfs are to Dover and England. Somehow they’re emblematic folk say, with a wistful sigh, you must at least go there before you leave.\" In this photograph by Ingrid Budge, they glow in the late afternoon sun, the tones of their rock of old red sandstone set on fire. Into this porous stone, the sea has carved blowholes, geos and sea stacks. The clfs can be reached via the West Coast Walk, south of Skara Brae. Climbers are often lured by the challenge of Yesnaby Castle. Neist PointAs far west as you can go on Skye, at the tip of the Duirinish Peninsula is a lighthouse,  metres above the water, that lures walkers towards it, just as it warns boats away. The rocky outcrop juts into the Minch, providing drmatic , as Irvine says, \"from here there are regular sightings of dolphins, porpoises, whales and basking sharks and, of course, seabirds on the clfs.\" Built in  based on a David Stevenson design. \"On the -minute up and down walk, the lighthouse doesn’t come into view immediately, but when it does it’s a stately edice, a worthy destination, as the field of stone cairns built by walkers, attests.\" For the ultimate view, visit at sunset and watch the light dip down in the west. Machair, South UistAs Irvine himself points out, the Machair, of course, is not a place, but a marvellous habitat, one of the rarest in Europe. Its formed by the meeting of low-lying coastline, shell fragments, strong winds, just the right amount of rainfall, and the impact of people and their grazing animals. In these coastal fields, wild flowers mixed with crop grasses like oats and rye. It is also, Irvine notes, home to the great yellow bumblebee and the \"secretive\" corncrake. \"If you are lucky enough to hear the corncrake’s distinctive krek call or see the swallows high in a wide blue sky, and the sea shimmering in the distance as you walk through a rippling field of flowers, and there’s nobody around for miles, you know that…le is good.\" Photograph by Dalziel. Black Cuillin, SkyeSo iconic, it was called simply The Ridge, in the film in which Danny Macaskill tackled it by bike. This is, quite possibly, Britains most dramatic mountain silhouette, and is formed from, notes Irvine, the \"remains of an eroded magma chamber of a giant volcano, its jagged edges sculpted by glacial activity and millennia of weathering\". Its also a challenging mountain climb: eight miles long, with eleven Munros and  other summits. However, though the Cuillin can seem daunting,writes Irvine, \"there are ways of experiencing it without risk or too much effort. Coire Lagan, a five-mile round trip from Glen Brittle, is a beautul mountain loch surrounded by the highest peaks. Also on the four-mile walk around Loch Coruisk , you are in an amphitheatre with one of the world’s most spectacular backdrops.\" Photograph by Richard CrossScotland The Best: The Islands by Peter Irvine is published by CollinsIt should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

I love being here in Leeds, I love the area, the city, the people. My family and I are really enjoying our time here.“So much of my emphasis is on the team and us as a group and what we’re about and how we’re going to achieve things together and any time that it draws attention to me, I don’t necessarily like it.“But I do want to show appreciation to the fans for reaching out to me.“What’s most important is that they – which they do amazingly – understand that we’re a real group, a team, a club that wants to represent the city and play football that they can be proud of – that’s what matters the most to me.”Leeds have a break of more than a fortnight before travelling to Crystal Palace on Monday, April .Marsch expects the relegation picture to have changed markedly by then and emphatically brushed off suggestions his side’s current tally of  points will be sufficient for safety.Askedthey were still in the battle to avoid the drop, he replied “Yeah. Everyone’s getting results around us.“People in Leeds tell me we have to fight for everything and I’ve said already that I’m OK with that.“Especially with this -day break now, it would have been really dficult to sit and watch the table knowing that we didn’t pick up the points that we wanted in this game. And things are going to get tight.“By the time we play against Palace, the table will be tight again. We just have to stay focused on us – I’ve said that a million times now but that’s the most important thing.”Marsch hopes the intermission before the Selhurst Park trip will help boost the fitness of some of his squad, including Kalvin Phillips.England midfielder Phillips has made successive substitute appearances following a hamstring problem sustained in December after playing  minutes in Hertfordshire.“Kalvin, he’s close to starting,” said Marsch.“I think we’ll use the next two weeks to get him fitter and stronger and healthier and ready to go for Palace.”Second-bottom Watford were booed off after a ninth consecutive home defeat – their longest losing streak in front of their own supporters since the - season.Hornets manager Roy Hodgson believes his squad are not as dispirited as some of those on the terraces ahead of hosting Brentford next weekend.“I don’t know that the mood amongst the players is that bad but the mood amongst the fans, I guess, is pretty bad because they keep coming here expecting their team to win and it doesn’t win,” said Hodgson.“But the mood amongst the players in actual fact isn’t as bad as all that and I think any fair-minded person who watched the game wouldn’t put our defeat down to any lack of belief or effort or desire.“Confidence comes from winning football matches and we don’t win matches, so how do you get that  There’s no words that are going to change that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"thomas-tuchel-calls-chelsea-deliver-what-makes-us-strong-real-madrid  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

This is what it tells me.“If we have it right, we can show our quality – because we have the quality.“It’s what makes us a dangerous and special group.”Ralph Hasenhüttls assessment following #SaintsFCs defeat at the hands of #CFC:— Southampton FCApril , Southampton were left to rue their third-heaviest defeat under Ralph Hasenhuttl, following the - reverses against Leicester and Manchester United.Askedbattling back from hefty defeats in the past would raise hopes of a similar response now, Hasenhuttl replied: “No, it doesn’t give confidence, it rings the alarm bells.“This is what we need to see, there’s no coincidence that our last clean sheet was at home against Norwich in our last good performance a few weeks ago.“We need to find a better way of defending, and a more tight pressing way because we are not convinced about this at the moment.“We have to find the right decisions, and you can be sure that next weekend you will see a team that’s playing in a very dferent way.”"},{"url":null,"title":"aaron-ramsdale-admits-faltering-arsenal-not-good-enough-brighton-defeat   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4008432.jpg--_the_people_you_are_visiting_may_be_particularly_vulnerable_.jpg?1629440923000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220407newsthe people you are visiting may be particularly vulnerable","story":"The public has been urged to keep wearing face coverings when visiting hospitals, care homes and other health and care settings.

That means there is much for visitors to explore, from ancient to modern history.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s Bay‘There’s no place like home’: Derry Girls writer Lisa McGee reacts to city being named among top places to live in NIYou have the completely intact -year-old Derry Walls which is a real selling point for tourists.Other historic landmarks include the Guildhall — where it now stands was once the middle of the River Foyle where ships moored. It was mostly destroyed by fire in  and after extensive rebuilding was opened in .Because it is relatively small in size, Derry is an easy place to navigate for visitors.A key piece of infrastructure built in recent times was the Peace Bridge.Nowadays it is hard to imagine the city without it, and it’s an area of recreation popular with walkers and joggers.That area is arguably the best feature of the city, expanding the city centre, linking to Ebrington, St Columb’s Park and the renovated railway station.The Peace Bridge connects the Cityside and Waterside it was a masterstroke both in practical terms and as an act of symbolism by reconnecting the largely Catholic Cityside to the traditionally unionist Waterside. Derry is also a city of culture — made official in  — with musicians, poets, painters and actors famous the world over.Danny Boy is one of the most famous songs in the world, and has been covered by Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Eva Cassidy. Phil Coulter, The Undertones, Dana, Cara Dillon, Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol fame, Red Organ Serpent Sound, Fighting with Wire, SOAK and Wood Burning Savages show the range of musicians Derry has produced.It is also a city with proud sporting traditions in GAA and football and has produced Olympic medallists and world champions who first learned their trade on Derry’s pitches, roads and rivers.Nowhere does a festival like Derry, but there should be more added to the calendar.You have Glasgowbury in Draperstown, the City of Derry Jazz and Big Band Festival, the legendary Halloween festival and, in recent times, the Foyle Maritime Festival, which have all proven popular.When considering Derry, you also have to factor in the location. A short drive across the border and you’re in some of the world’s nicest beaches including Dunree and Tullagh Bay.To Derry’s advantage in the Sunday Times survey was an average house price of £,.“Reaping the rewards of years of investment and with a fine cultural reputation, this much-improved city stands out as somewhere cool, credible and cheap, with a bright future,” The Sunday Times states.But most people in the city would disagree with that statement, as multiple-deprivation measures, unemployment rates and analysis of investment show the second city has not received a great deal of inward investment.For example, since Invest NI was formed in  until   it has assisted , new jobs in Belfast whereas Foyle got , and East Londonderry ,.In that time it invested £.bn in Belfast and £.bn between Foyle and East Londonderry.Most ReadSuspended DUP councillor William Walker in child grooming case has left Northern IrelandDecoratordenies that he ripped off almost  pensionersMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtAnger as Doug Beattie ‘noose’ poster is left ahead of Lurgan anti-NI Protocol rallyTop VideosPlayFootage of an attack on police in Killough Co.DownPlayVideo: Car overturns on A outside BelfastPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattieLatest Northern IrelandMancharged over Dunmurry and Carryduff shop burglariesRishi Sunak scraps reported protocol proposal over tax cuts for British businesses ing to Northern IrelandGlentoran boss admits they are unlikely to make up ground after defeat by CrusadersCltonville draw a point in the right direction for content Linfield boss David HealyWhen Tim Mouncey found himself on wed alert for Portadown’s Cup Final appointmentLatestMancharged over Dunmurry and Carryduff shop burglariesRishi Sunak scraps reported protocol proposal over tax cuts for British businesses ing to Northern IrelandAaron Ramsdale admits faltering Arsenal ‘not good enough’ in Brighton defeatSaoirse-Monica Jackson: Working on Derry Girls a ‘gt’ in helping city ‘open up’ on Troubles legacyThomas Tuchel calls on Cha to deliver ‘what makes us strong’ at Real Madrid,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway which will be cut down through the steep shore bank and will involve reinforced piling.Once completed the station will be ready to take delivery of the new leboat, which will be named the Bryant and Eleanor Girling after a generous RNLI benefactor.SAINTFIELD mdash Three workmen and two police officers required hospital treatment after a chemical spill in Saintfield last week.Four  gallon drums containing a mixture of acid and caustic soda, fell from a lorry on the Old Grand Jury Road at around am on Friday morning, initiating a full-scale emergency response from the Fire Brigade.Appliances from Ballynahinch and Downpatrick were sent to the scene and a specialist equipment carrying emergency tender unit was also despatched from Belfast.The incident occurred as the articulated lorry was leaving a yard on the Old Grand Jury Road carrying a large number of the chemical-containing drums.The four drums fell from the lorry, with two spilling several hundred gallons of the corrosive mixture onto the road.The lorry driver and his two assistants quickly righted the drums but suffered from fume inhalation, as did two police officers who arrived on the scene minutes after the spill.All five were treated at the Downe Hospital but were later released.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Environmentrsquos proposals for the management of Strangford Lough have been welcomed as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside community have been looking for.ldquoThe new body represents a wide spectrum of community support, including the pockets of power which were driven largely by their own self-interests, he said.MOURNES mdash Health officials have been accused of ldquoplucking figures from nowhere to justy closure plans for Newcastlersquos Mourne House.The Eastern Health Council heard this week that a renovation figure of pound, for the residential home has been produced without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report.The claims were made by a deputation from the Friends of Mourne House which addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide a first response to cardiac emergencies pending the arrival of an ambulance.The presentation was made on Monday to Portaferry GPs Dr Desmond Compton and Dr David Peacock by Mr Peter Welsh, the Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health Boardrsquos chief ambulance officer, Mr Alan Murray.The Ambulance Service has funded the inclusion of sophisticated diagnostic facilities on the defibrillator, as well as communication systems for the doctors to ensure their immediate availability.BALLYNAHINCH mdash One of Down Districtrsquos biggest charity events of the year will take place in Ballynahinch next month.The Ballynahinch Lions k and fun runs will be staged on Saturday, May , and once again look likely to raise several thousand pounds for charity.In its third year the event has already raised pound, and the organisers are hoping that next monthrsquos event will top the pound total which was raised last year.This yearrsquos beneficiaries will be the Leukaemia Research Fund, the Marie Curie Trust, Beaconsfield, and Lions charities.The event, which is over a proven course and backed by the Northern Ireland Amateur Athletics Federation, has already become established as one of the major events on the athletics calendar and will attract runners from many parts of the province.Once again the run will begin at .pm at the Community Centre in Windmill Street, and part of the route will be through the grounds of the Montalto Estate.Lots of dferent categories have been designated by the Lions and there are prizes on offer for practically everything, from the first k runner home to the best fancy dress team.A new aspect of the event this year will be the Tracy Barr Memorial Trophy which school teams will be competing for over the K fun run

When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility. In that context, I do not consider there to be any need for this proposal.A spokesperson for Arc said there was still a ldquoclear need to develop a ldquonew, modern waste infrastructure for the region.It said the proposed facility would boost recycling, reduce emissions and provide green electricity.ldquoIt is essential that Arc has an opportunity to review the planning reasons behind the ministerrsquos statement and we will carefully consider todayrsquos announcement in that light over the next few days, added the spokesperson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Museum to shut doors over Easter  ","story":"THE Down County Museum in Downpatrick will be closed over Easter.The announcement came just hours after Newry, Mourne and Down Council refused to confirmthe museum would be open to the public over the busy Easter holiday period.Initially, the local authority would only confirm that a decision on the Easter opening would be made in ldquodue course, but within hours of informing the Recorder of this and the paper being printed, it was finally revealed that the museum would remain closed.The council has subsequently confirmed that a reduced staff team is delivering services at the museum mdash which only opens between am and pm from Wednesday and Friday mdash and it is ldquowith regret that it will not be open at Easter.The Recorder understands that are six vacant staff positions at the museum and that up to five staff members are currently off sick.Adverts to recruit new museum staff have been published this week with the local authority looking to appoint and assistant curator, education and outreach officer, museum assistant and a cultural assistant.While council officials are hoping to have new employees in place next month, the local authority has not made clear how many new staff are being recruited and what the Downpatrick museumrsquos future opening hours will be.The museum has been at the centre of a controversial staff restructuring process.Downpatrick SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said thee council should have made it clear last week that the museum would be closed at Easter.Welcoming plans to recruit new employees, he suggested that councillors should be briefed at a one-off council meeting by senior local authority officials on exactly what is happening at the museum.ldquoI remain disappointed that the museum will not be open at Easter. While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,. A good job well done.With the racing season in full flow, EDAC club members were quick to get signed up on the recent membership night so that they can keep training and also avail of the club discount when entering races.They might also have been encouraged by the raffle which was held at the sign-up.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMarsch’s men secured breathing space in the scrap for Premier League survival following goals from Raphinha, Rodrigo and Jack Harrison at Vicarage Road.Many Leeds followers were dismayed when fans’ favourite Marcelo Bielsa was dismissed in late February but a sold-out away end chanted the name of his successor during a signicant success over relegation rivals.American Marsch – who has masterminded  points from the last  available – was touched by the vocal backing but keen to focus attention on the club’s collective achievements.“I don’t think it was the first time ,” he said.“But, to be honest with you, I appreciate it I appreciate our fans so much. I love being here in Leeds, I love the area, the city, the people. My family and I are really enjoying our time here.“So much of my emphasis is on the team and us as a group and what we’re about and how we’re going to achieve things together and any time that it draws attention to me, I don’t necessarily like it.“But I do want to show appreciation to the fans for reaching out to me.“What’s most important is that they – which they do amazingly – understand that we’re a real group, a team, a club that wants to represent the city and play football that they can be proud of – that’s what matters the most to me.”Leeds have a break of more than a fortnight before travelling to Crystal Palace on Monday, April .Marsch expects the relegation picture to have changed markedly by then and emphatically brushed off suggestions his side’s current tally of  points will be sufficient for safety.Askedthey were still in the battle to avoid the drop, he replied “Yeah. Everyone’s getting results around us.“People in Leeds tell me we have to fight for everything and I’ve said already that I’m OK with that..remove“Especially with this -day break now, it would have been really dficult to sit and watch the table knowing that we didn’t pick up the points that we wanted in this game. And things are going to get tight.“By the time we play against Palace, the table will be tight again. We just have to stay focused on us – I’ve said that a million times now but that’s the most important thing.”Marsch hopes the intermission before the Selhurst Park trip will help boost the fitness of some of his squad, including Kalvin Phillips.England midfielder Phillips has made successive substitute appearances following a hamstring problem sustained in December after playing  minutes in Hertfordshire.“Kalvin, he’s close to starting,” said Marsch.“I think we’ll use the next two weeks to get him fitter and stronger and healthier and ready to go for Palace.”Second-bottom Watford were booed off after a ninth consecutive home defeat – their longest losing streak in front of their own supporters since the - season.Hornets manager Roy Hodgson believes his squad are not as dispirited as some of those on the terraces ahead of hosting Brentford next weekend.“I don’t know that the mood amongst the players is that bad but the mood amongst the fans, I guess, is pretty bad because they keep coming here expecting their team to win and it doesn’t win,” said Hodgson.“But the mood amongst the players in actual fact isn’t as bad as all that and I think any fair-minded person who watched the game wouldn’t put our defeat down to any lack of belief or effort or desire.“Confidence comes from winning football matches and we don’t win matches, so how do you get that  There’s no words that are going to change that.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Jesse Marsch not keen on taking the limelight after Leeds fans sing his name article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This year almost  thousand people across the UK took part, counting more than  million birds.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Each autumn, Jays, a colourful member of the crow family, can often be seen flying back and forth finding and hiding acorns to help see them through the winter. These are then hidden in the cracks and crevices of trees, but also in leaf litter on the ground. An inidual jay can store around , acorns each year and many remain buried to grow into oak trees.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Mother and her daughter counting birds in their garden, Bedford, UK, January The RSPB’s Chief Executive, Beccy Speight said “We don’t know the reasons for the sudden increase in Jay sightings this year. It may be down to food availability as we have reports that last year was poor for acorns, but whatever the reason a sighting of this stunning bird is enough to raise one’s spirits any day of the year let alone on a gloomy January weekend.“It’s been brilliant to see so many people taking part again this year, taking time out to watch and reconnect with birds and then generously submit their sightings to help RSPB scientists gain some insights into how our garden birds are faring.”Big Garden Birdwatch results also found a small increase in Greenfinch compared to . This gives scientists a glimmer of hope that this might be the first signs of a popuation recovery, but only time will tell. In recent years the Greenfinch has suffered a population crashcaused by a severe outbreak of the disease trichomonosis and as a consequence the species was added to the UK Red list last year. This infection is spread through contaminated food and drinking water, or by birds feeding one another with regurgitated food during the breeding season. Garden owners can help slow transmission rates by temporarily stopping the provision of foodill birds are seen and making sure that garden bird feeders are cleaned regularly.The House Sparrow remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings as the most commonly seen garden bird with more than . million recorded sightings throughout the weekend. Blue Tit and Starling remained in the number two and three positions respectively.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Family filling up a bird feeder in their garden, Potton, Bedfordshire, UK, January Over its four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world. It was first to alert the RSPB to the decline in song thrush numbers, which are still down % compared to the first Big Garden Birdwatch in . This species was a firm fixture in the top  in . By , its numbers were less than half those recorded in , it came in at  in the rankings this year, seen in just % of gardens.Throughout the first half of the spring term the nation’s school children took part in the RSPB’s Big Schools Birdwatch. The UK-wide survey of birds in school grounds saw amost , school children and their teachers spend an hour in nature counting the birds. Woodpigeon was the most numerous species seen with an average of eight per school and was seen in % of all schools that took part. Blackbird was a close second with an average of seven per school.Beccy added: “Connecting with nature doesn’t have to stop with Big Garden Birdwatch.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"wit wisdom this too shall pass ","story":"Police advise of closure of Lisburn’s Moira Road    pictures from Lurgan anti-protocol parade and rallyNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsAdam Harbinson. WIT  WISDOM: This too shall passWith our recent fine weather I’ve been doing more than my usual five-to- miles a day walking, an activity that, with many of my countrymen, I developed during the lockdown, when there was little  to do, writes Adam Harbinson.By The NewsroomSunday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Last week was idyllic as I walked along the Donegal coast from Moville to Greencastle it was magical, and it struck me again, that while we all know the value of regular exercise, fresh air and social engagement, we might never really know just how beneficial such days are for our physical and mental health.But what perhaps, on the flipside, will our memories of - be in  years time  We’ll be asking ourselves, how on Earth did we remain sane  Brexit has wreaked havoc on our economy, piled on top of which was Covid-. I can still feel the cloud of gloom that settled on me when a radio announcer was suggesting that all over s would not be allowed outside the door of their homes for  weeks.Thankfully it didn’t quite come to that.Then came the murderous war in Ukraine, with pictures being flashed onto our screens of European families hiding in cellars in fear or their lives, not to mention the bloody carnage. But how does this bad news affect our mental health To further exacerbate my potential for anxiety I can tell you that five of my close friends and family members are suffering from le-threatening health problems one has even invited me to his rd birthday party, when he and I know full well that in reality it’s a ‘going away’ party. I’m in my mid-s and while I feel as mentally and physically fit as I was in my s, the thing I hate about my age is that so many of my contemporaries are dropping like flies.So, what can we do to protect ourselves  Firstly we must regulate our intake of deadly news regular exercise and getting out into the countryside is helpful too. Gratitude is of vital importance, so let’s get a pen and paper and make a list of the many aspects of our lives for which we can be truly grateful.But is that enough  You might say no, but since there might be little we can do to help our suffering brothers and sisters, we must recognise the need for serenity to accept the things we cannot change and thecourage to change the things we can.One thing’s for sure this too will pass.

One of the most successful initiatives we have been involved in has been the local ‘Row on Row’ project, which we run alongside our friends in Dalaradia. The scheme recognises those who perished during the World Wars, sacricing their lives for our freedom.Members of RATH helped to provide festive cheer during the Covid pandemic.“The project provided an opportunity for members of the local community to pay their respects over the last two years, particularly when Royal British Legion Remembrance Services were curtailed during the Coronavirus pandemic.“Rathcoole is the second largest housing estate in Europe and we feel it is a travesty our estate does not have a memorial garden in memory of the great men and women of the World Wars. We hope one can be built in the future.”As well as helping to commemorate Newtownabbey’s veterans and war fallen, members of RATH have been at the forefront of helping to provide a physical outlet for disabled residents.The spokesperson explained: “Another thing which has been successful for us is the establishment of a disability football team, Antrim Newtownabbey Disability FC. It is currently the only such team in the borough, catering for both male and female ambulant players and has around  members ranging in ages from seven to  for the junior sides and  plus for the senior team.Antrim Newtownabbey Disability FC caters for male and female players.“We train on a Wednesday evening and we are always open to welcoming new players, no matter what your ability or playing level is.“When the Irish Football Association Disability League starts back again we hope to be participating in this and other tournaments such as the George Best Community Cup.”Female members of Rath also established the TOM project in a move to tackle sanitary poverty within Rathcoole estate and the surrounding areas. The programme provides free products and advice to those in need.Within a year of the group’s formation, RATH’s  members and associated volunteers found their services in demand due to the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic, with the community group stepping-up to help support vulnerable residents in the Rathcoole area.Detailimg the impact of the restrictions on the Dunanney Centre group’s activities, the spokesperson added: “During Covid- our group continuously worked through the pandemic collecting prescriptions, delivering food, and making wellbeing packs funded by numerous agencies including Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, as well as a £k investment to our group by Bryson to help people with essestial supplies such as gas, food, electrictricity and brand new white goods and electronic tablets.“We have also helped Rathcoole PS with brand new reading books and stationary to every primary pupil and also provided items to the nursery unit. This was all possible thanks to a Lottery ‘Awards For All’ grant we recieved.”Looking ahead to further successful initiatives, the spokesperson concluded: “Our plans for the next year are to continue to make our estate the best wee place it can and show how great the people of Rathcoole are when we all stick together.”For more information, check out the RATH Community Group Facebook page, Antrim and Newtownabbey Disability FC on social media and the TOM Project on Facebook.----Read More Read MoreEmployment skills boost for Newtownabbey residentsNewtownabbey  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most Popular pictures from Lurgan anti-protocol parade and rally...News pictures of young stars on the stage at Portadown Music F...NewsPolice ordered man to ‘drop to his knees’ during Larne town ...NewsFuel costs: NI’s most expensive and cheapest petrol and dies...NewsPSNI investigating theft of much-loved working sheepdogs...NewsMost PopularWeight loss: can a Lumen ‘metabolism reader’ help you lose w...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “The COVID- Omicron iant is extremely infectious and, despite best efforts, can spread quickly in health and social care settings. “Please remember to wear a face covering when you are visiting. The people you are coming to see may be particularly vulnerable to the virus - as may other patients or residents. “Also, do not visityou have symptoms of respiratory infection.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “Wearing a face covering remains an important way to protect others, as well as yourself.

The eagerly anticipated successor to the popular Barrys Amusements opened its doors for the first time on Saturday amid great excitement. Hundreds of people young and old filed through the doors all afternoon as the magic ed to Portmagic - and just in time for Easter. The good news is that Currys is now up and running, boasting all the old Barrys favourites and adding some new ones too. And for those with old Barrys tokens - no, you cant use them, but you can help the RNLI by dropping them into collection boxes dotted around the complex. The fun park has chosen the charity as its partner - a thoughtful gesture given the important work volunteers do in the waters off the north coast. But for now, after two years of zero craic because of the pandemic, all roads lead to the Port and what promises to be a fun-filled holiday period. Happy days.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dcfaadcddf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_feacaddcdefd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
