In the old days, the party demanded fanatical belief now mute complicity will suffice.Of course, China’s plans are not just for domestic consumption. The country is exporting its surveillance and artificial intelligence technology all over the world.And other autocracies are eager buyers, keen to ape China’s authoritarianism. Western democracies are also supplicants — as Britain proves with its courting of Huawei, hailed by Chinese police as being a ‘close partner’ in ‘technological’ and ‘digitalised’ police work.The technological export drive is part of China’s concerted effort to expand its global influence. Until the recent past, the Beijing Government was deeply reluctant to play any role on the international stage, preferring to concentrate on domestic problems. But again, all that has changed under Xi Jinping, whose outlook combines socialist ideology with nationalistic pride.The latter impulse is demonstrated in a host of initiatives: in the massive expansion of China’s military in the funding of Chinese institutes in Western universities and think tanks in the control of Chinese student associations overseas in the creation of global propaganda machines like the television’s ‘Voice of China’ whose European headquarters was recently set up in London in the vast Chinese investments in Africa and South America in the support for colossal infrastructure projects like Britain’s new nuclear power plant at Hinckley Point and in the ferocity of response to any attacks on Xi’s regime.The brave and proud Hongkongers out in the street are a living rebuttal for the party’s claim that the Chinese aren’t cut out for democracy. And that is exactly why our governments should stand by them.Xi’s regime has shown that it sees itself in ideological competition with us. Through its slide back to totalitarianism, it has rejected our values and tries to undermine them.

I’m so grateful that they’re giving all people a place to worship.\u0027On June 1, the first day of Pride Month, Swift took to Instagram with a lengthy post, in which she wished her fans a happy Pride Month, then took the opportunity to encourage people to write letters to their senators explaining why they should pass the Equality Act, which had already been passed by the House.She accompanied the post with an image of the letter that she had written Tennessee senator, Republican Lamar Alexander.That same night, Swift performed at an iHeart Wango Tango concert in Los Angeles while wearing a rainbow colored outfit, encouraging fans to contact their senators to appeal to them about passing the Equality Act, according to Reuters.Taylor Swift¿s Surprise Performance at Stonewall Inn (Watch) ¿ VarietyTaylor Swift Wishes NYC\u0027s Stonewall Inn \u0027Happy Pride\u0027 at Surprise Set | BillboardTaylor Swift\u0027s Pride anthem leads to \u0027influx\u0027 of GLAAD donationsTaylor Swift Makes $113,000 Donation to Tennessee LGBTQ Advocacy Group ¿ Rolling StoneGLAAD on Twitter: \u0026quotYou could be GLAAD with a limited edition sticker invoking @taylorswift13\u0027s lyrics from #YouNeedToCalmDown.

His widely admired stories have won several prizes there and this extraordinary collection is his first to be translated into English. In the title story, a provincial teacher tries to make sense of his past. Many of the boys he once taught are now dead (“drugs, war, ‘business’ …”), and the people who control the town are cruel, dishonest, paranoid nostalgic for old Soviet certainties. The story’s small town is a microcosm of modern Russia, where corruption permeates almost every thread of the social fabric and power is often synonymous with theft.Nobel prize-winner Svetlana Alexievich, whose own bleak reportage provides similarly forensic insights, has written a short preface to Rock, Paper, Scissors. With a nod to Osipov’s other profession as a cardiologist, she describes his prose as “an accurate, unforgiving diagnosis of Russian life”. The stories leave you thinking “how difficult it is to love humanity – wonderful, repulsive, and terrifying as it is”, but are also suffused with compassion.The opening piece is set in a provincial hospital. It includes a micro-manifesto for writers: in order to love humanity and the wider world, they must “notice, recall, invent”. The details of Russian life are evocative – pelmeni dumplings, pickles and salted fish. It begins: “The Provinces as home: warm, grubby, ours.” It’s a scene-setting sentence to inspire confidence readers won’t waste their time.You can fall for Central Russia, Osipov writes in a typically double-edged comment, as easily “as a woman can fall for a loser”. Whether pitiless or pitiable, women don’t have a great time in his stories. If they’re not Machiavels with hairy moles, they are murdered by random strangers or chased by axe-wielding offspring. One relatively positive female protagonist is the nameless musician in “Polish Friend”, a whimsical story with speculative forays into the near future. “Who knows what will have become of the EU … by then?” Osipov writes gloomily.There are redemptive moments here, and comedy, but mundane graft and casual violence permeate Osipov’s tales. The worst events are often described with devastating economy (“Some say that it was pills she took, others – poison”). One character, a doctor who makes extra money escorting sick people to the US, falls asleep thinking of synonyms for “pointless”.These are engaging translations from a team with a very strong track record. Anne Marie Jackson helped introduce anglophone readers to the unforgettable tales of Teffi. Boris Dralyuk has produced pitch-perfect versions of stories by Isaac Babel, among others, and co-edited the phenomenal Penguin Book of Russian Poetry.As a doctor and a writer of short stories, Osipov inevitably gets compared to Anton Chekhov, whose dark comedy is clearly influential, as is the Chekhovian idea that the writer’s task is not to solve problems but to state them clearly. After the power is switched off when a group of actors are forced to abandon their town, one quotes: “Mother asks you not to chop down the cherry orchard until she’s gone.” Osipov follows (sometimes literally) the rule of “Chekhov’s gun”: include only details relevant to the story. When an actor buys a revolver it spells trouble, especially when his wife is drawn to the charismatic leading man. And when a mercurial oligarch fires his rifle at crows from the window of his tower, it can’t end well.Chekhov is not the only literary undercurrent in Osipov’s deceptively simple prose. Russian poets including Pushkin and Lermontov, with their fatal duels and years in exile, often bubble to the surface. The provincial teacher falls in love with one of his students because of her essays on Dostoevsky teacher and student argue with each other by quoting Tolstoy or Akhmatova. The story “Moscow-Petrozavodsk”, set on a 14-hour train journey from the Russian capital to the northern city of Petrozavodsk, echoes Benedict Erofeyev’s Soviet-era novel Moscow-Petushki about a surreal, vodka-sodden train journey.And there are shades of Bulgakov, another literary doctor, in the theatrical “After Eternity”.Poetry and music are redemptive lifelines for Osipov’s embattled characters. Learn poems by heart, one character’s mother tells him, and you can take them wherever you go: “They don’t weigh you down.” There’s something poetic in the stories themselves, in their well-crafted style, form and imagery. Literature, happiness, survival itself are minor miracles in Osipov’s collection. As the narrator of the opening story muses: “Dostoevsky is a thing of wonder, and the fact that we Russians are still here – that, too, is a thing of wonder.”• Rock, Paper, Scissors and Other Stories by Maxim Osipov, translated by Boris Dralyuk, Alex Fleming and Anne Marie Jackson is published by The New York Review of Books (RRP £11.99).

But even the cornerstone of Sir Phillip Green’s retail empire is in need of urgent repair.“It reminds me of a very nice Marks \u0026amp Spencer from 20 years ago,” says James Clark of the London College of Fashion as he walks around the six-floor Topshop and Topman site on London’s Oxford Street.While the trendy Urban Outfitters next door has festival-ready outfits such as floaty dresses and flowery shirts with reusable water bottles, Topshop’s mannequins look as if they are dressed for a wedding or parents’ barbecue.“It seems a bit culturally adrift, a bit white middle class. If it’s aiming at a young street demographic of conscious consumerism,” Clark says.Once a fashion leader, featured in Vogue with celebrities clamouring to attend its catwalk shows, Topshop and Topman have lost their edge and seem confused about who they are targeting.Green admitted to the BBC on Thursday that Arcadia, the retail group behind Topshop and other high street brands, might not have reacted quickly enough to a market that has changed “fundamentally”. He said: “Whether we haven’t changed quickly enough or we had too many shops or whatever, I think it’s a combination of a lot of things. The answer is you can’t get it all right.”If the flagship store is aimed at under 40s – the millenials and generation Z – then there are few references to the themes that run close to their heart: sustainability multi-cultural urban life and gender-fluidity. There is no link to the online world of selfies and sharing your shopping “haul”.Hannah Middleton, a lecturer in fashion buying at the London College of Fashion, says: “Generation Z like a connection with a story that they can tap into. There is no evidence of that and our students are aware of Green. Even secondary school students I have worked with say they won’t go into Starbucks because it doesn’t pay tax. They are aware of what is going on in a way my generation perhaps wasn’t and react accordingly.”While the Oxford Street site houses a hairdressers, a brow bar and a Benugo cafe, it is a long way from the multi-faceted destination store that Primark recently opened in Birmingham, which had at least one fun food or beauty service on every floor.And that store lays bare Arcadia’s challenge. Primark reportedly spent £70m on the shop, while Arcadia has just £75m set aside to revamp hundreds of sites as part of a £135m turnaround plan.If the Topshop and Topman London flagship needs work, there are many smaller dowdier shops around the country that must struggle to make a profit. It also has six other brands – Wallis, Miss Selfridge, Evans, Burton, Dorothy Perkins and Outfit – that have drifted even more off course than the two leading labels.This week, Green won approval from creditors for a restructure that will enable Arcadia to close an initial 50 stores, out of an estate of 570 standalone units, and cut rents on nearly 200 more, with the loss of 1,000 jobs. Topshop has more than 300 outlets in the UK, including standalone sites. But the store, rent and jobs cull will only help boost profits in the short term. Arcadia will have to take some even tougher decisions in the years ahead if it wants to last.Trimming down the eight brands in his Arcadia empire and closing many more stores should be top of the list.Miss Selfridge and Evans are already set to close most of their stores and focus on selling online or via wholesale.Maureen Hinton, an analyst at retail research firm GlobalData said Green needed to focus on Topshop and Topman: “Those are the ones that have fallen less far. If they had the right person running them with vision on brand and understanding the target market you could recover those brands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6f7057d2fabbe8ef8f6b948eb4e2e98b68890fb/0_24_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37bc70582d5eafc2a887e4807cb93ab0","title":"the guardian view on the bbc a broadcaster not a welfare agency","story":"This week the BBC announced that next year most over-75s will have to pay to watch television. This is a wrongheaded and mean policy forced upon the BBC by former Conservative chancellor George Osborne, who should not have been allowed to load the cost of his damaging social and economic policies on to the corporation. Even worse, the Conservative government has broken a 2017 election promise that the licence fee would remain free to pensioners over the age of 75 for the duration of this parliament. It is the politics of the absurd for Downing Street to ask the BBC to revisit a “disappointing” decision after forcing the broadcaster to enact a policy the Conservative party had promised it would block.Unless the policy is reversed, the BBC will become a welfare agency that means-tests elderly people. It will be obliged to push through a cruel and unnecessary benefit cut that will affect 4.6m households which have no way of increasing their income to pay for it. Even taking into account those rich enough to pay and those exempted through pension credit, at least 2.5 million poor pensioners face an annual £150 bill. For more than a million of the oldest people in our country, television is their main form of company.Mr Osborne’s licence fee wheeze was to compel the corporation to agree to shouldering the expense out of its own £4bn licence fee income. But handing out free licences would have placed an ever-growing burden on the BBC’s finances. If it were to allow over-75s to continue watching for free then the BBC would have to have found about half a billion pounds in savings. That figure alone should put pay to the idea that somehow a few celebrity salaries could be cut to fill the gap. Mr Osborne and his ilk in the Conservative party do not care one jot for the potential extraordinary reputational risk the BBC faces. Such Tories perhaps have never thought much of the idea of universal public services cared little about enriching democratic debate and informing citizens or about the cultural consumption patterns of the nation.They perhaps could not see the problem if the BBC ends up taking a frail pensioner to court for not possessing a TV licence that for years they have had for free. This is a blindness brought on by ideology. This crude piece of politicking compromises the BBC’s independence. Of all the possible candidates for leadership of the Tory party, it seems only Sajid Javid’s team has understood this. This will not be lost on the Conservative members due to elect the next prime minister, who are likely to be closer to 75 than most of the population.About half a million people have already signed the Age UK online petition demanding the government takes back responsibility for funding free TV licences. There is an obvious opportunity to do so. Although the funding of the free TV licence regime ends in June 2020, the government will begin discussing the BBC’s funding settlement in 2021. Any costs incurred because of the over-75 strategy by the corporation between June 2020 and April 2022, when the new licence fee begins, should be covered by the government without jeopardising BBC services.From then onwards, if the state believes that pensioners should have free services, it ought to pay for them. The UK’s licence fee model, in which advertisements or subscription fees are not part of funding, is also present – but far more expensive – in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Britain’s media market is large enough to make investment here worthwhile, but not so big that there’s no reason to export. Netflix will set up a UK office Apple TV will launch and Amazon is hiring. It’s true that the BBC can loom too large in parts of the media landscape, but it faces being shrunk by US media giants and a politics inimical to public service broadcasting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de35b4fb7de02f4129f49c906334a451a85169d6/0_495_7350_4410/master/7350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1270266831fdac3cf9eb08ebbc925633","title":"the rise of the conscious consumer how to shop responsibly","story":"The way we shop is changing for the better, helped by a new breed of independent brands and carefully curated retail destinations, such as Coal Drops Yard, providing a thoughtful, ethical approach to consumptionWhen it comes to shopping, sustainability has never been more front and centre in our minds – from Adidas committing to using only recycled plastic by 2024 to Elle magazine dedicating last year’s September issue to sustainable fashion, and the ’s associate fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley stating: “I’m going to change what I wear and what I write about”. Garment production has doubled in the past 15 years, with £140m worth of clothes a year ending up in landfill – and it’s a situation shoppers are very mindful of.And, in these times of digital overload, we’re rediscovering the joy of a bricks-and-mortar experience. Forward-thinking new retail districts are reimagining the traditional high street, putting an emphasis on storytelling and craftsmanship with stores for customers to spend time in. Coal Drops Yard is one such destination. As the name suggests, the warren of Victorian brick viaducts was originally built to house coal. In the 1990s, the warehouses became a new home for the clubbing scene, and now the area has reinvented itself once again as London’s most progressive shopping and restaurant district, home to a new crop of fashion and lifestyle brands encouraging shoppers to practise a more mindful kind of consumption.Tracey Neuls, a cult footwear designer who has been producing handmade shoes for the past 19 years, is just one example of a craftsperson pushing for conscious consumption. Each new design is sculpted by Neuls in clay, then produced by a Portuguese atelier using Italian leather from ethical tanneries. In her Coal Drops Yard boutique, shoes hang from the ceiling on ribbons, to be admired and encircled like mini works of art.“The rise in disposable fashion is having a wonderful knock-on effect of creating a new shopper who is more interested in quality than quantity,” explains Neuls. “Excess and choice are being replaced by emotive purchases that people intend to have around for years. We have customers who have described our shoes that they bought some 10 years ago as if they were talking about their pets – with the same attachment and love.”Neuls’ philosophy is shared by her Coal Drops Yard neighbour, leather goods brand LPOL. Founded by husband and wife team Katy Bell and John Maskell, they put responsible material sourcing and zero waste at the centre of everything they do. “As designers, we’re concerned with three things: fabric, form and function,” they explain. “The sole aim is to combine them effortlessly, sustainably and desirably in the best traditions and progression of our craft.”Meanwhile, clothes that haven’t found such long-term relationships (yet) are welcomed at Boutique by Shelter, where secondhand garments get a new lease of life. Furnished with salvaged materials and stocked with a covetable pick-and-mix of designer, high street and vintage donations, all at a fraction of the original price. But the store’s appeal goes far beyond bargains – it’s a community hub, a volunteering scheme, a source of vital funds to end homelessness and a way to tackle fashion’s waste problem.The new wave of conscious consumption doesn’t only mean caring for the planet it’s about the human impact, too, supporting businesses that strive to do good on both sides of the counter, and this is reflected in Coal Drop Yard’s retailers. Form\u0026ampThread champions fair pay for its factory workers Beija London strives to make more inclusive underwear, designed for women of all sizes with comfort and empowerment at heart and design practice and community space STORE Store addresses social imbalance within art, design and architecture by hosting creative courses for the general public, with a special focus on creating new opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Trying harder is something we could surely all be doing. But while responsible shopping is just that – a responsibility, to do our due diligence and look a little harder at our habits – it’s not to say it shouldn’t be a pleasure, too. Neuls feels that the secret to more conscious shopping is foregoing trends and following your instinct. “If you shop with the view to invest in footwear that doesn’t go out of fashion, that makes you feel confident and makes you smile, then you are on the right track,” she says. And that’s an emotional investment as much as a financial one.In fact, most sustainability champions agree that it’s positivity – not guilt, shame or scary statistics – that drives the best trade. Make people feel bad about themselves, and they seek solace in a high street binge. But make us feel good about ourselves, and we’ll make good choices. The Coal Drops Yard approach might just be the future of shopping – do it slowly, and do it in style.To find out more about Coal Drops Yard’s carefully curated offerings, head to coaldropsyardshop-eat-drink"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c34e225c6f1c137c3e5a6b042f8fe6701555058d/0_56_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18abbecd3cdfcac60f30ace2eb1a4d65","title":"a level maths paper leaked online before exam","story":"Exam board Edexcel launches investigation after Twitter post offers full paper for £70An investigation has been launched after an A-level maths paper was circulated online before the exam.Images of the test paper by Edexcel appeared on social media on Thursday afternoon. The exam board’s parent company, Pearson, said the images “were circulated in a very limited way” before students sat the exam on Friday.“Having visited a small group of centres within scope of the investigation, we have identified one centre in serious breach of correct practice,” the firm said.“All students should be reassured we have well-established processes in place to ensure no one will be advantaged or disadvantaged, and this paper will not have to be resat.”Two questions from the paper first appeared on Twitter in a since-deleted post which offered students the whole paper for £70.It is not the first time Pearson has had maths papers leaked. Last year, an A-level maths paper apparently appeared for sale online the night before thousands of students sat the exam.The company was also forced to make last-minute changes to two A-level papers in 2017 after receiving reports that some students had gained access to them in advance.Both leaks were investigated by the police, with evidence passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration over whether criminal charges should be brought.In April, it was revealed that Pearson would pilot a scheme in which exam papers would be microchipped to track the date, time and location of each bundle.An online petition calling for the exam board to take the leak into consideration when it set grade boundaries has been signed by hundreds of students.The petition’s creator, Jenny Li, described the situation as “very unfair” for students who had not seen the paper before the exam.A student who sat the exam told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he was “frustrated” by the leak.“I’m not frustrated because I feel like I absolutely failed the paper it wasn’t that kind of frustration,” he said.“It’s more the frustration that I’ve spent two years studying maths A-level only to realise that some students through some sort of opportunity could have not learned anything for two years – and just spent £70 and got an A-level.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1b5d2d8b972e2616bb82625957a6132fbe3ecc5/0_98_5184_3111/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f1b48e0b72a949fc212e88ee7c3b5ae","title":"australias oldest things how mind boggling timelines meet the climate emergency","story":"They were here before us and should live on long afterwards. With 12 years to avert catastrophe, we need to imagine the aeons to come and consider the creatures that outlive usWilbur the tortoise has, in all probability, lived more than a hundred years.“From his size and weight and general health,” says Adam Lee, a reptile keeper at the Melbourne zoo, “we put him at about 110 but there’s no real way of telling with giant tortoises unless you have them from birth or as a hatchling.”Lee holds out a carrot and Wilbur snaps at it.He seems, in certain respects, even older than that – ancient, even prehistoric. He scrabbles on the concrete floor with ungainly dinosaur feet. When I stroke his massive shell, I can feel the scratches on the keratin. He snuffles as he eats, his leathery jaw jutting irritably, as if he were an aggrieved pensioner discussing franking credits.Yet the idea that this creature, happily munching his carrot, predates the first world war astonishes me.Lee explains that giant tortoises (or “GTs”, as he calls them) can live more than 200 years, perhaps reaching 250.This sounds preposterous. But I already know of Jonathan, a giant tortoise estimated to have been born in 1832 but still alive and well on the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic.And there, at the feet of those long-dead gentlemen, stands Jonathan, looking entirely the same as he does in photos from 2019.On the day of my visit, Melbourne is blustery, so much so that Lee warns via email not to expect “much GT action”, since Wilbur and his slightly younger companion (perhaps 90), Little John, both dislike the cold.I can’t bring myself to complain, given the prolonged warmth of Victoria’s autumn.In our times, unseasonal temperatures – even when pleasant – fill me with a vague dread. The novelist Delia Falconer discusses climate change ushering in “a new age of signs and wonders”, in which the most commonplace occurrences (a warm evening, the absence of birdlife at a particular spot, an unexpected change in vegetation) feel fraught with ecological portent.“As the world becomes more unstable in the grip of vast and all-pervasive change,” Falconer writes, “it’s difficult to discern exact chronologies, relationships and meaning.”More than anything, I think, climate change politicises time.Lord Byron considered the sea “the image of eternity”. For us, however, it means flux and uncertainty, with new research suggesting the oceans could rise as much as two metres by 2100.“Time is money,” warned Benjamin Franklin, and the extractive industries built fortunes taking him at his word. Fossil fuels depend on million-year old geological processes so that, in a sense, industrial society runs by burning natural history.The emergence of Greta Thunberg as a global leader highlights the temporal inequity of climate change, a burden shrugged off by the old on to the young.According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we have, perhaps, 12 years to avoid catastrophe – and one of those years has nearly passed. Yet, though we must act immediately, we need to imagine the aeons to come, planning for outcomes well beyond the threescore years and ten that scripture allots to a man.Hence my interest in Wilbur and the other creatures whose lives extend longer than our own.In 2007 biologists identified a 50-ton bowhead whale caught near Alaska as more than 115 years old by examining pieces of a particular harpoon stuck in its shoulder bone. Because whalers only used that patented variety of exploding lance for a brief window in the late 1880s, the fragments confirmed scientists’ suspicion that bowheads could live several centuries – providing, of course, they weren’t harpooned first.Three years ago researchers from the University of Copenhagen dated a female Greenland shark as 392 years old.As the ’s Nicola Davis explained, that means the animal “was born during the reign of James I, was a youngster when René Descartes set out his rules of thought and the great fire of London raged, saw out her adolescent years as George II ascended the throne, reached adulthood around the time that the American revolution kicked off, and lived through two world wars”.It’s a mind-boggling chronology, an illustration of just how wondrous our planet remains.Yet there’s a less ennobling aspect to the story.Where the Alaskan whale was classified by a projectile scar, scientists established the shark’s age because of an atomic bomb. The nuclear tests conducted in the 1950s sent spikes of carbon-14 into the food chain of the North Atlantic, which then provided a kind of date stamp, marking a particular layer of proteins as they grew on the poor fish’s eye.The oldest creatures carry marks from the people of the past and so remind us of the scars we’re already leaving on lives in the future. That becomes even more obvious when we turn from the animal kingdom to the realm of plants, the demesne in which the true ancients reside.When I ask the Australian National University’s Dr Matthew Brookhouse, an academic and forester, about the longest living trees in Australia, he tells me that a great deal depends on what classifies as life.“What we need to define is the age of what we’re interested in: is it the age of the organism or is it the age of the stem?”If we focus on the stem – the bit that looks like our traditional notion of a tree – then certain Huon pines can be dated as 2,000 years old, making them more or less contemporaneous with Jesus.“But what we see as the tree,” Brookhouse continues, “is really just the current aerial projection of the organism, like a potato or like a daffodil bulb. What’s lying below the ground is the longer term embodiment of that organism.”On that basis, particular clumps of Huon pine could be said to have lived for perhaps 11,000 years, with vegetative cloning rendering the “inidual” trees genetically identical.Other forms of clonal life stretch way back into deep time. A stand of king’s holly in Tasmania has been alive for an unthinkable 43,000 years, while the Wollemi pine of the Blue Mountains west of Sydney seems to have been cloning itself for even longer.There is, Shakespeare said, “no clock in the forest” and the Wollemi pine proves his point.Brookhouse specialises in dendrochronology, the science of tree rings. The field itself stretches way back in history, with the ancient Greeks aware that trees produced new rings each year and Leonardo da Vinci describing the correlation between ring thickness and climate.“Except for those very long records from ice cores, the temperature reconstructions ning thousands of years come from tree rings,” Brookhouse says. “Much of what we know about how unusual the current temperatures are comes from trees.”Experts described this year’s bushfires in Tasmania as “unprecedented”, with the blazes devastating some of the oldest forests in the state. King’s holly will, in all likelihood, become extinct in the wild, partly because of fires and partly from an introduced pathogen called phytophthora, something that also menaces the Wollemi pine.Does Brookhouse feel an emotional tug when studying such ancient trees?“Absolutely. I have a sense of quiet respect for an organism that predates us all.” He hesitates. “Actually, the emotional response to plants of that age is strongest when you see them deteriorating or when you see one die as a consequence of something we’ve done – really, in the blink of an eye, relative to the tree’s experience.”The Melbourne keeper explains that the reptiles and amphibians with which he works have been hit hard by the environmental emergency, with frogs, in particular, in the midst of a mass extinction.The giant tortoises once roamed in great herds (known, delightfully, as “creeps”) across the volcanic atolls around the Seychelles.“I wish I could have been there,” says Lee, giving Wilbur’s long neck a rub. “It is like a dream.”But sailors on the long voyages necessitated by the spice trade seized the giant tortoises as living meat stores, and now conservationists classify all the species as endangered.Wilbur came to the zoo from the Seychelles in 1965, back in an era when keepers could casually swap a koala for a tortoise.Since then, much has changed but Wilbur retains a long memory for his friends and for his enemies.“I spent a lot of time bonding with him,” says Lee. “At the start he’d be trying to bite me and over time the aggression diminished to the point where, when I came in, he would walk over and rest his head on my arm and let me give him a little scratch. He’s much better these days but there used to be two or three keepers that he was friendly with – and with all the rest he was aggressive.”“Well, as aggressive as a giant tortoise can be.”Without question, Wilbur’s age lends him a certain gravitas. He could, after all, live for another century or more – and, because of that, he seems almost a proxy for nature as a whole, separate from humanity and yet now dependent upon us.“We have pets and you generally know you are going to outlive your pet,” Lee says. “It is weird to think that here is another animal with which I have a bond and it’s going to outlive me. It’s humbling.”A single reptile or an organism as massive as the Great Barrier Reef: the fates of those other lives is now entwined with our own.Lee rubs the tortoise’s head once more.“I am here with Wilbur now I will do what I can to make his life positive. And then it will be someone else’s turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d197e54b98d4707b7447505a264b95636a09ba5d/0_0_1677_1117/master/1677.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aeb168a3ecfeaaf61d94f14724dd3e25 2020w","title":"heatwave florence plays host to ss20 menswear shows in pictures","story":"Givenchy’s elegant villa takeover, artist Sterling Ruby’s debut collection and a pool party celebration for MSGM – here are the highlights from the Pitti Immagine Uomo showcase"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/385e883f8a4f0a5dcf2c853c419b0d0ea16133e5/0_0_3723_2233/master/3723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=775e15b9cc164b7e1d58a44df97183f8","title":"bread salad kale pine nuts roast lemon zuni cafe recipe meera sodha","story":"An inspiring dish at one of the city’s landmark restaurants has evolved into this sunny bread saladI ate the best bread salad of my life at Zuni Cafe in San Francisco in 2015, came back home and regularly ate a variation on it for at least a year afterwards.Over time, those variations became bolder and wilder, until just a faint shadow of the original existed. Hence today’s recipe, which adopts the currants, olive oil, pine nuts and bread of the prototype, but is in every other way different. Still, if we have anything to learn from all this, it is that where there is travel, there is inspiration, and where there is bread, make bread salad.Prep 10 minCook 20 minServes 4 as a starter or side dish150g kale, big ribs removed, roughly chopped3 tbsp black olive tapenade – I like Belazu’s200g focaccia, cut into 15mm x 15mm chunks3 large garlic cloves, peeled and minced1 lemon, quartered into four wedges3 tbsp pine nuts3 tbsp currants6 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to serve3 sticks celerySaltHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Throw the kale and tapenade into a food processor and pulse to smithereens. Taste, add a little more tapenade, if you like, then pulse again to mix.Put the bread chunks in a big bowl with the garlic, lemon wedges, pine nuts and currants. Drizzle over three tablespoons of oil and toss with your hands to coat. Tip out on to a baking tray so it sits in a single layer (keep the bowl to one side) and roast for 10 minutes, until the bread and pine nuts are golden – check after five minutes to make sure they’re not burning.While the bread is roasting, finely slice the celery and put it in the reserved bowl with the kale and tapenade mixture.Once the bread is golden, take the tray out of the oven and add everything except the lemon wedges to the bowl. When they’re cool enough to handle, squeeze the juice from two of the wedges over the salad, drizzle over three more tablespoons of oil and add a half teaspoon of salt, or to taste. Mix, mix, mix with your hands, until the bread soaks up some of the surrounding flavours, then taste again, adding a little more roast lemon juice or salt, if you like.

In contrast to our dusty corner of the Middle East, the land of hot dogs, endless seafood, Taco Bell, Flintstones-shaped vitamins, multi-channel colour TV and big Cadillacs had a dizzying effect on my young mind. Decades on, I still adore California for its abundance and irreverence, for its rich cultural blend and for its ability to excite and give pleasure.Cobb salad is (almost) as American as apple pie, and is all about the shameless display of abundance (hence the even longer-than-usual ingredients list here).

Peel and cut each egg into four wedges, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, and set aside.Now for the dressing: put the mango, lime juice, oil and anchovies in a blender and blitz smooth. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the coriander, chilli, a third of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper.Put a teaspoon and a half of oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the asparagus, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for four minutes, turning a couple of times, until softened and charred, then transfer to a plate. Pour another tablespoon of oil into the same pan, add the corn kernels, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and charred in places – about four minutes – then transfer to a bowl. Pour another tablespoon of oil into the pan, turn the heat to high and, once it’s very hot, add half the prawns, half the garlic, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook, turning occasionally, for three minutes, until just cooked through and browned. Transfer to a separate bowl and repeat with the remaining prawns and garlic.In a small bowl, toss the tomatoes with a pinch of salt and pepper and a teaspoon and a half of oil.In a large bowl, toss the lettuce, coriander, a third of the dressing, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Spread out on a large platter. Top the lettuce with separate piles of tomato, avocado, onion, corn, asparagus, eggs, prosciutto and prawns. Squeeze the half-lime over everything, drizzle half the remaining dressing on top and serve the rest alongside.You can use ready-made corn tortillas, if you prefer, but the real deal are hard to beat. You can make them a few hours ahead of time, too – just cover them with a tea towel, and later warm them through in the pan after cooking the steak. Cheese can be a bit messy to fry, so just use uncooked if you prefer.3 jalapeño chillies, halved lengthways and finely sliced (remove the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat)1½ tsp chilli flakes (or red bell pepper flakes if you prefer less heat)60ml sunflower oil, plus extra for greasing and fryingSalt125g masa harina (Mexican corn flour) - from supermarkets or online)360g skirt steak, in one piece140g piece mature cheddar, cut into 12 x 5mm-thick rectangles (optional)1 small orange, skin and pith removed, then cut into segments (discard any pips)1 tbsp coriander leaves, finely sliced2 limes, cut into wedges, to servePut a frying pan on a high heat until smoking hot, then toast the jalapeños, stirring a few times, until they start to char – about four minutes. Tip into a bowl, leave to cool for two minutes, then stir in the chilli flakes, oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt.Put the masa harina, a good pinch of salt and 250ml hot water in a medium bowl and stir until it comes together into a dough. Once it’s cool enough to handle, knead vigorously until you end up with a smooth ball the consistency of Play-Doh, then ide into 12 30g pieces. Lightly grease a work surface and your hands with oil, roll each piece into a smooth ball, and cover with clingfilm.Put a nonstick frying pan on a high heat and, once it’s smoking, add a teaspoon and a half of oil. Fry the steak for a minute and a half to two minutes on each side, or until well browned on the outside and still rare inside. Transfer to a board, season generously with salt, cover with foil and leave to rest while you cook the tortillas.Wipe the pan clean and return it to a high heat. Meanwhile, get a clean tea towel ready and cut out a few pieces of greaseproof paper, which you’ll need to help you press the dough. Place one piece of dough between two sheets of paper, then, using a heavy-based pan (or other similar round weight), press down evenly and firmly on the dough to spread it out into a 10cm-12cm-wide circle. Remove the top sheet of paper and use the bottom sheet to transfer the tortilla to the hot pan. Cook for 90 seconds until nicely browned, then flip and cook for another minute to brown the other side. Transfer the cooked tortilla to the tea towel, fold it over to cover, then repeat with the remaining dough (cook as many tortillas at a time as will fit in the pan).Once all the tortillas are done, reduce the heat under the pan to medium-high. In two batches, lay in the cheese slices and leave for a minute or two, until they form a crust on the bottom and start to melt. Using a butter knife, carefully lift out the slices (they will be melting and hot) and put on a plate, so they don’t stick.With a very sharp knife, cut the steak against the grain into 24 slices, each about ½cm thick. Top each warm tortilla with two slices of steak and one slice of cheese. Cut any thicker orange segments in half lengthways and top each taco with a couple of pieces.Sprinkle over the coriander, drizzle over some jalapeño oil and serve at once with the lime wedges alongside for squeezing on top.Rocky road may have originated in Australia in the 1850s, but it is incredibly popular in California, and indeed across the entire US, where you can find it in all sorts of combinations of chocolates and nuts.

He scored 14 goals to propel them to safety and will provide France’s firepower, alongside Moussa Dembélé and Marcus Thuram, son of the former defender Lilian. “JP always wants to work,” said Oswald Tanchot, his former coach. “Every morning, he would ask what he could do in addition to the day’s training.” At 6ft 4in, Mateta says his style is similar to Zlatan Ibrahimovic.There are no Barcelona players in Spain’s squad but in Olmo they possess a La Masia graduate.

James Maddison, Mason Mount and Morgan Gibbs-White are gifted but there is a belief that Foden remains the country’s crown jewel. Pep Guardiola said Foden “will be an important player” for Manchester City “for the next decade” and everything points towards him being at the heart of things for his country, too. Foden – whose scurrying runs leave defenders queasy – has shown touches of class when afforded opportunities.

He is the most exciting teenager on the Serie A scene for years and it is sad that the embryonic stages of his career have been overshadowed by monkey noises and other racial slurs. Kean, born to Ivorian parents, admirably confronted the racists in Cagliari’s Curva Nord and went on to score in consecutive games, including the winner against Milan. He joined Juve from Torino at 14 and made his league debut at 16, six months before becoming the first player born this millennium to score in one of Europe’s top five leagues. He is at the forefront of a squad teeming with talent, including Nicolò Zaniolo, the Roma midfielder called up to the senior squad before making his under-21s bow.Real Madrid’s new striker needs no introduction after a stellar season of 17 goals in the Bundesliga for Eintracht Frankfurt and another 10 in the Europa League. Quick, powerful and with an eye for goal that persuaded the 13-times European champions to shell out €60m, Jovic has scored twice in six appearances for Serbia’s senior side but in the next few weeks in Italy and San Marino will form a potentially lethal attacking duo with his former Benfica teammate Andrija Zivkovic. Serbia were a massive disappointment two years ago, finishing with one point, but can be expected to fare much better.The towering defender has been turning heads in Italy with assured displays for Sampdoria’s and is expected to recover from injury for Denmark’s opening fixture against Germany. Andersen has a reputation as a ball-playing defender capable of launching attacks from deep in his own half with his excellent passing – attributes that have reportedly attracted interest from Arsenal. He and the Genk striker Marcus Ingvartsen will need to be at their best if Denmark are to reach the last four for the third time.Born in Austria to Ghanaian parents but raised in Milton Keynes from the age of six, Danso moved to Augsburg as a teenager in 2014 and has become a regular in the German top flight.

Danso is comfortable in midfield but is expected to form a defensive partnership with the former Real Madrid player Philipp Lienhart. Austria’s coach, Werner Gregoritsch, can call on three others with senior caps: Stefan Posch, Xaver Schlager and Hannes Wolf.The gangly winger spent last season on loan at Fortuna Düsseldorf, where he scored 10 goals in 22 starts, including two against Bayern Munich. Lukebakio made one appearance for the Democratic Republic of the Congo three years ago in a friendly but switched to Belgium’s youth sides after coming through Anderlecht’s youth system. “He’s so unpredictable with his pace and dribbling,” Fortuna’s coach, Friedhelm Funkel, said. Watford may call on him next season, depending on his performances with Belgium. The dark horses’ other notable players include the striker Siebe Schrijvers and the 17-year-old midfielder Yari Verschaeren.Started Croatia’s victory over Wales in the Euro 2020 qualifiers and has been tipped as the brightest of their new generation. Comfortable on either flank, Brekalo made an instant impact on his senior debut against Spain in November’s Nations League meeting when he set up the winner before playing the second half against England. “It is an indescribable feeling,” he said, “because one minute I was a hardcore fan, who always followed the national team on my feet with all my energy, sometimes out of control through emotions, and the next moment I am standing on iconic Wembley in front of the same people who I shared the stands with.” Croatia also have the powerful Marseille defender Duje Caleta-Car, Everton’s Nikola Vlasic and the former Barcelona player Alen Halilovic and could take some stopping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10ecd146f24dff523f25137448f6492bbd4ea445/1117_1300_3426_2055/master/3426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f869a0bb008ca8b250600920a0362e19","title":"manchester united aaron wan bissaka crystal palace transfer talks","story":"Manchester United are holding further talks with Crystal Palace this weekend aimed at agreeing a fee for Aaron Wan-Bissaka after the player indicated his preference would be a summer move to Old Trafford.An opening bid for the England Under-21 international that would have been worth in excess of £40m was rejected by the south London club earlier this month, but United remain intent upon securing Wan-Bissaka as a key component in a revamp of their back-line. The 21-year-old is under contract until 2022 and Palace had no great desire to sell, but the youth-team graduate has made clear to his current employers that he would be keen to seize what he considers might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.The opening offer had included various potential bonus and additional payments which made the overall package more appealing, but Palace will only countenance a sale if the fee to be received is guaranteed to be in excess of £50m. Intriguingly, they could explore whether it would be feasible to remove a sell-on clause agreed when Wilfried Zaha was sold by United back to Palace in early 2015 as part of the negotiations. That would effectively serve to bolster the potential fee further towards £60m.Wan-Bissaka, originally a winger, enjoyed an eye-catching first full season in senior football last term after graduating through the south London club’s academy, excelling at right-back and making 39 appearances in all competitions. The defender is currently preparing for the summer’s junior European Championships in Italy and San Marino, with United hopeful they will eventually add him to Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s options, with Antonio Valencia among 14 players to be released when their contracts expire at the end of the month. They have already secured the young Wales winger, Daniel James, from Swansea City.Palace are already exploring their options over a replacement for Wan-Bissaka, and contact has been made with the Belgian international Timothy Castagne. The Atalanta defender, capped five times, has spent the last two seasons in Serie A and made 28 top-flight appearances as they finished third and qualified for the Champions League last season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

By  Ronald PurserMindfulness has gone mainstream, with celebrity endorsement from Oprah Winfrey and Goldie Hawn. Meditation coaches, monks and neuroscientists went to Davos to impart the finer points to CEOs attending the World Economic Forum. The founders of the mindfulness movement have grown evangelical. Prophesying that its hybrid of science and meditative discipline “has the potential to ignite a universal or global renaissance”, the inventor of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Jon Kabat-Zinn, has bigger ambitions than conquering stress. Mindfulness, he proclaims, “may actually be the only promise the species and the planet have for making it through the next couple of hundred years”.So, what exactly is this magic panacea? In 2014, Time magazine put a youthful blonde woman on its cover, blissing out above the words: “The Mindful Revolution.” The accompanying feature described a signature scene from the standardised course teaching MBSR: eating a raisin very slowly. “The ability to focus for a few minutes on a single raisin isn’t silly if the skills it requires are the keys to surviving and succeeding in the 21st century,” the author explained.But anything that offers success in our unjust society without trying to change it is not revolutionary – it just helps people cope. In fact, it could also be making things worse. Instead of encouraging radical action, mindfulness says the causes of suffering are disproportionately inside us, not in the political and economic frameworks that shape how we live. And yet mindfulness zealots believe that paying closer attention to the present moment without passing judgment has the revolutionary power to transform the whole world. It’s magical thinking on steroids.There are certainly worthy dimensions to mindfulness practice. Tuning out mental rumination does help reduce stress, as well as chronic anxiety and many other maladies. Becoming more aware of automatic reactions can make people calmer and potentially kinder. Most of the promoters of mindfulness are nice, and having personally met many of them, including the leaders of the movement, I have no doubt that their hearts are in the right place. But that isn’t the issue here. The problem is the product they’re selling, and how it’s been packaged. Mindfulness is nothing more than basic concentration training. Although derived from Buddhism, it’s been stripped of the teachings on ethics that accompanied it, as well as the liberating aim of dissolving attachment to a false sense of self while enacting compassion for all other beings.What remains is a tool of self-discipline, disguised as self-help. Instead of setting practitioners free, it helps them adjust to the very conditions that caused their problems. A truly revolutionary movement would seek to overturn this dysfunctional system, but mindfulness only serves to reinforce its destructive logic. The neoliberal order has imposed itself by stealth in the past few decades, widening inequality in pursuit of corporate wealth. People are expected to adapt to what this model demands of them. Stress has been pathologised and privatised, and the burden of managing it outsourced to iniduals. Hence the pedlars of mindfulness step in to save the day.But none of this means that mindfulness ought to be banned, or that anyone who finds it useful is deluded. Reducing suffering is a noble aim and it should be encouraged. But to do this effectively, teachers of mindfulness need to acknowledge that personal stress also has societal causes. By failing to address collective suffering, and systemic change that might remove it, they rob mindfulness of its real revolutionary potential, reducing it to something banal that keeps people focused on themselves.The fundamental message of the mindfulness movement is that the underlying cause of dissatisfaction and distress is in our heads. By failing to pay attention to what actually happens in each moment, we get lost in regrets about the past and fears for the future, which make us unhappy. Kabat-Zinn, who is often labelled the father of modern mindfulness, calls this a “thinking disease”. Learning to focus turns down the volume on circular thought, so Kabat-Zinn’s diagnosis is that our “entire society is suffering from attention deficit disorder – big time”. Other sources of cultural malaise are not discussed. The only mention of the word “capitalist” in Kabat-Zinn’s book Coming to Our Senses: Healing Ourselves and the World Through Mindfulness occurs in an anecdote about a stressed investor who says: “We all suffer a kind of ADD.”Mindfulness advocates, perhaps unwittingly, are providing support for the status quo. Rather than discussing how attention is monetised and manipulated by corporations such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple, they locate the crisis in our minds. It is not the nature of the capitalist system that is inherently problematic rather, it is the failure of iniduals to be mindful and resilient in a precarious and uncertain economy. Then they sell us solutions that make us contented, mindful capitalists.By practising mindfulness, inidual freedom is supposedly found within “pure awareness”, undistracted by external corrupting influences. All we need to do is close our eyes and watch our breath. And that’s the crux of the supposed revolution: the world is slowly changed, one mindful inidual at a time. This political philosophy is oddly reminiscent of George W Bush’s “compassionate conservatism”. With the retreat to the private sphere, mindfulness becomes a religion of the self. The idea of a public sphere is being eroded, and any trickledown effect of compassion is by chance. As a result, notes the political theorist Wendy Brown, “the body politic ceases to be a body, but is, rather, a group of inidual entrepreneurs and consumers”.Mindfulness, like positive psychology and the broader happiness industry, has depoliticised stress. If we are unhappy about being unemployed, losing our health insurance, and seeing our children incur massive debt through college loans, it is our responsibility to learn to be more mindful. Kabat-Zinn assures us that “happiness is an inside job” that simply requires us to attend to the present moment mindfully and purposely without judgment. Another vocal promoter of meditative practice, the neuroscientist Richard Davidson, contends that “wellbeing is a skill” that can be trained, like working out one’s biceps at the gym. The so-called mindfulness revolution meekly accepts the dictates of the marketplace. Guided by a therapeutic ethos aimed at enhancing the mental and emotional resilience of iniduals, it endorses neoliberal assumptions that everyone is free to choose their responses, manage negative emotions, and “flourish” through various modes of self-care. Framing what they offer in this way, most teachers of mindfulness rule out a curriculum that critically engages with causes of suffering in the structures of power and economic systems of capitalist society.The term “McMindfulness” was coined by Miles Neale, a Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist, who described “a feeding frenzy of spiritual practices that provide immediate nutrition but no long-term sustenance”. The contemporary mindfulness fad is the entrepreneurial equal of McDonald’s. The founder of McDonald’s, Ray Kroc, created the fast food industry. Very early on, when he was selling milkshakes, Kroc spotted the franchising potential of a restaurant chain in San Bernadino, California. He made a deal to serve as the franchising agent for the McDonald brothers. Soon afterwards, he bought them out, and grew the chain into a global empire. Kabat-Zinn, a dedicated meditator, had a vision in the midst of a retreat: he could adapt Buddhist teachings and practices to help hospital patients deal with physical pain, stress and anxiety. His masterstroke was the branding of mindfulness as a secular spirituality.Kroc saw his chance to provide busy Americans with instant access to food that would be delivered consistently through automation, standardisation and discipline. Kabat-Zinn perceived the opportunity to give stressed-out Americans easy access to MBSR through an eight-week mindfulness course for stress reduction that would be taught consistently using a standardised curriculum. MBSR teachers would gain certification by attending programmes at Kabat-Zinn’s Center for Mindfulness in Worcester, Massachusetts. He continued to expand the reach of MBSR by identifying new markets such as corporations, schools, government and the military, and endorsing other forms of “mindfulness-based interventions” (MBIs).Both men took measures to ensure that their products would not vary in quality or content across franchises. Burgers and fries at McDonald’s are the same whether one is eating them in Dubai or in Dubuque. Similarly, there is little variation in the content, structuring and curriculum of MBSR courses around the world.Mindfulness has been oversold and commodified, reduced to a technique for just about any instrumental purpose. It can give inner-city kids a calming time-out, or hedge-fund traders a mental edge, or reduce the stress of military drone pilots. Void of a moral compass or ethical commitments, unmoored from a vision of the social good, the commodification of mindfulness keeps it anchored in the ethos of the market.This has come about partly because proponents of mindfulness believe that the practice is apolitical, and so the avoidance of moral inquiry and the reluctance to consider a vision of the social good are intertwined. It is simply assumed that ethical behaviour will arise “naturally” from practice and the teacher’s “embodiment” of soft-spoken niceness, or through the happenstance of self-discovery. However, the claim that major ethical changes will follow from “paying attention to the present moment, non-judgmentally” is patently flawed. The emphasis on “non-judgmental awareness” can just as easily disable one’s moral intelligence.In Selling Spirituality: The Silent Takeover of Religion, Jeremy Carrette and Richard King argue that traditions of Asian wisdom have been subject to colonisation and commodification since the 18th century, producing a highly inidualistic spirituality, perfectly accommodated to dominant cultural values and requiring no substantive change in lifestyle. Such an inidualistic spirituality is clearly linked with the neoliberal agenda of privatisation, especially when masked by the ambiguous language used in mindfulness. Market forces are already exploiting the momentum of the mindfulness movement, reorienting its goals to a highly circumscribed inidual realm.Mindfulness is easily co-opted and reduced to merely “pacifying feelings of anxiety and disquiet at the inidual level, rather than seeking to challenge the social, political and economic inequalities that cause such distress”, write Carrette and King. But a commitment to this kind of privatised and psychologised mindfulness is political – therapeutically optimising iniduals to make them “mentally fit”, attentive and resilient, so they may keep functioning within the system. Such capitulation seems like the farthest thing from a revolution – more like a quietist surrender.Mindfulness is positioned as a force that can help us cope with the noxious influences of capitalism. But because what it offers is so easily assimilated by the market, its potential for social and political transformation is neutered. Leaders in the mindfulness movement believe that capitalism and spirituality can be reconciled they want to relieve the stress of iniduals without having to look deeper and more broadly at its causes.A truly revolutionary mindfulness would challenge the western sense of entitlement to happiness irrespective of ethical conduct. However, mindfulness programmes do not ask executives to examine how their managerial decisions and corporate policies have institutionalised greed, ill will and delusion. Instead, the practice is being sold to executives as a way to de-stress, improve productivity and focus, and bounce back from working 80-hour weeks. They may well be “meditating”, but it works like taking an aspirin for a headache. Once the pain goes away, it is business as usual. Even if iniduals become nicer people, the corporate agenda of maximising profits does not change.If mindfulness just helps people cope with the toxic conditions that make them stressed in the first place, then perhaps we could aim a bit higher. Should we celebrate the fact that this perversion is helping people to “auto-exploit” themselves? This is the core of the problem. The internalisation of focus for mindfulness practice also leads to other things being internalised, from corporate requirements to structures of dominance in society. Perhaps worst of all, this submissive position is framed as freedom. Indeed, mindfulness thrives on doublespeak about freedom, celebrating self-centered “freedoms” while paying no attention to civic responsibility, or the cultivation of a collective mindfulness that finds genuine freedom within a co-operative and just society.Of course, reductions in stress and increases in personal happiness and wellbeing are much easier to sell than serious questions about injustice, inequity and environmental devastation. The latter involve a challenge to the social order, while the former play directly to mindfulness’s priorities – sharpening people’s focus, improving their performance at work and in exams, and even promising better sex lives. Not only has mindfulness been repackaged as a novel technique of psychotherapy, but its utility is commercially marketed as self-help. This branding reinforces the notion that spiritual practices are indeed an inidual’s private concern. And once privatised, these practices are easily co-opted for social, economic and political control.Rather than being used as a means to awaken iniduals and organisations to the unwholesome roots of greed, ill will and delusion, mindfulness is more often refashioned into a banal, therapeutic, self-help technique that can actually reinforce those roots.Mindfulness is said to be a $4bn industry. More than 60,000 books for sale on Amazon have a variant of “mindfulness” in their title, touting the benefits of Mindful Parenting, Mindful Eating, Mindful Teaching, Mindful Therapy, Mindful Leadership, Mindful Finance, a Mindful Nation, and Mindful Dog Owners, to name just a few. There is also The Mindfulness Colouring Book, part of a bestselling subgenre in itself. Besides books, there are workshops, online courses, glossy magazines, documentary films, smartphone apps, bells, cushions, bracelets, beauty products and other paraphernalia, as well as a lucrative and burgeoning conference circuit. Mindfulness programmes have made their way into schools, Wall Street and Silicon Valley corporations, law firms, and government agencies, including the US military.The presentation of mindfulness as a market-friendly palliative explains its warm reception in popular culture. It slots so neatly into the mindset of the workplace that its only real threat to the status quo is to offer people ways to become more skilful at the rat race. Modern society’s neoliberal consensus argues that those who enjoy power and wealth should be given free rein to accumulate more. It’s perhaps no surprise that those mindfulness merchants who accept market logic are a hit with the CEOs in Davos, where Kabat-Zinn has no qualms about preaching the gospel of competitive advantage from meditative practice.Over the past few decades, neoliberalism has outgrown its conservative roots. It has hijacked public discourse to the extent that even self-professed progressives, such as Kabat-Zinn, think in neoliberal terms. Market values have invaded every corner of human life, defining how most of us are forced to interpret and live in the world.Perhaps the most straightforward definition of neoliberalism comes from the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, who calls it “a programme for destroying collective structures that may impede the pure market logic”. We are generally conditioned to think that a market-based society provides us with ample (if not equal) opportunities for increasing the value of our “human capital” and self-worth. And in order to fully actualise personal freedom and potential, we need to maximise our own welfare, freedom, and happiness by deftly managing internal resources.Since competition is so central, neoliberal ideology holds that all decisions about how society is run should be left to the workings of the marketplace, the most efficient mechanism for allowing competitors to maximise their own good. Other social actors – including the state, voluntary associations, and the like – are just obstacles to the smooth operation of market logic.For an actor in neoliberal society, mindfulness is a skill to be cultivated, or a resource to be put to use. When mastered, it helps you to navigate the capitalist ocean’s tricky currents, keeping your attention “present-centred and non-judgmental” to deal with the inevitable stress and anxiety from competition. Mindfulness helps you to maximise your personal wellbeing.All of this may help you to sleep better at night. But the consequences for society are potentially dire. The Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek has analysed this trend. As he sees it, mindfulness is “establishing itself as the hegemonic ideology of global capitalism”, by helping people “to fully participate in the capitalist dynamic while retaining the appearance of mental sanity”.By deflecting attention from the social structures and material conditions in a capitalist culture, mindfulness is easily co-opted. Celebrity role models bless and endorse it, while Californian companies including Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Zynga have embraced it as an adjunct to their brand. Google’s former in-house mindfulness tsar Chade-Meng Tan had the actual job title Jolly Good Fellow. “Search inside yourself,” he counselled colleagues and readers – for there, not in corporate culture – lies the source of your problems.The rhetoric of “self-mastery”, “resilience” and “happiness” assumes wellbeing is simply a matter of developing a skill. Mindfulness cheerleaders are particularly fond of this trope, saying we can train our brains to be happy, like exercising muscles. Happiness, freedom and wellbeing become the products of inidual effort. Such so-called “skills” can be developed without reliance on external factors, relationships or social conditions. Underneath its therapeutic discourse, mindfulness subtly reframes problems as the outcomes of choices. Personal troubles are never attributed to political or socioeconomic conditions, but are always psychological in nature and diagnosed as pathologies. Society therefore needs therapy, not radical change. This is perhaps why mindfulness initiatives have become so attractive to government policymakers. Societal problems rooted in inequality, racism, poverty, addiction and deteriorating mental health can be reframed in terms of inidual psychology, requiring therapeutic help. Vulnerable subjects can even be told to provide this themselves.Neoliberalism ides the world into winners and losers. It accomplishes this task through its ideological linchpin: the inidualisation of all social phenomena. Since the autonomous (and free) inidual is the primary focal point for society, social change is achieved not through political protest, organising and collective action, but via the free market and atomised actions of iniduals. Any effort to change this through collective structures is generally troublesome to the neoliberal order. It is therefore discouraged.An illustrative example is the practice of recycling. The real problem is the mass production of plastics by corporations, and their overuse in retail. However, consumers are led to believe that being personally wasteful is the underlying issue, which can be fixed if they change their habits. As a recent essay in Scientific American scoffs: “Recycling plastic is to saving the Earth what hammering a nail is to halting a falling skyscraper.” Yet the neoliberal doctrine of inidual responsibility has performed its sleight-of-hand, distracting us from the real culprit. This is far from new. In the 1950s, the “Keep America Beautiful” campaign urged iniduals to pick up their trash. The project was bankrolled by corporations such as Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch and Phillip Morris, in partnership with the public service announcement Ad Council, which coined the term “litterbug” to shame miscreants. Two decades later, a famous TV ad featured a Native American man weeping at the sight of a motorist dumping garbage. “People Start Pollution. People Can Stop It,” was the slogan. The essay in Scientific American, by Matt Wilkins, sees through such charades.At face value, these efforts seem benevolent, but they obscure the real problem, which is the role that corporate polluters play in the plastic problem. This clever misdirection has led journalist and author Heather Rogers to describe Keep America Beautiful as the first corporate greenwashing front, as it has helped shift the public focus to consumer recycling behaviour and thwarted legislation that would increase extended producer responsibility for waste management.We are repeatedly sold the same message: that inidual action is the only real way to solve social problems, so we should take responsibility. We are trapped in a neoliberal trance by what the education scholar Henry Giroux calls a “disimagination machine”, because it stifles critical and radical thinking. We are admonished to look inward, and to manage ourselves. Disimagination impels us to abandon creative ideas about new possibilities. Instead of seeking to dismantle capitalism, or rein in its excesses, we should accept its demands and use self-discipline to be more effective in the market. To change the world, we are told to work on ourselves — to change our minds by being more mindful, nonjudgmental, and accepting of circumstances.It is a fundamental tenet of neoliberal mindfulness, that the source of people’s problems is found in their heads. This has been accentuated by the pathologising and medicalisation of stress, which then requires a remedy and expert treatment – in the form of mindfulness interventions. The ideological message is that if you cannot alter the circumstances causing distress, you can change your reactions to your circumstances. In some ways, this can be helpful, since many things are not in our control. But to abandon all efforts to fix them seems excessive. Mindfulness practices do not permit critique or debate of what might be unjust, culturally toxic or environmentally destructive. Rather, the mindful imperative to “accept things as they are” while practising “nonjudgmental, present moment awareness” acts as a social anesthesia, preserving the status quo.The mindfulness movement’s promise of “human flourishing” (which is also the rallying cry of positive psychology) is the closest it comes to defining a vision of social change. However, this vision remains inidualised and depends on the personal choice to be more mindful. Mindfulness practitioners may of course have a very different political agenda to that of neoliberalism, but the risk is that they start to retreat into their own private worlds and particular identities — which is just where the neoliberal power structures want them.Mindfulness practice is embedded in what Jennifer Silva calls the “mood economy”. In Coming Up Short: Working-Class Adulthood in an Age of Uncertainty, Silva explains that, like the privatisation of risk, a mood economy makes “iniduals solely responsible for their emotional fates”. In such a political economy of affect, emotions are regulated as a means to enhance one’s “emotional capital”. At Google’s Search Inside Yourself mindfulness programme, emotional intelligence (EI) figures prominently in the curriculum. The programme is marketed to Google engineers as instrumental to their career success — by engaging in mindfulness practice, managing emotions generates surplus economic value, equivalent to the acquisition of capital. The mood economy also demands the ability to bounce back from setbacks to stay productive in a precarious economic context. Like positive psychology, the mindfulness movement has merged with the “science of happiness”. Once packaged in this way, it can be sold as a technique for personal life-hacking optimisation, disembedding iniduals from social worlds.All the promises of mindfulness resonate with what the University of Chicago cultural theorist Lauren Berlant calls “cruel optimism”, a defining neoliberal characteristic. It is cruel in that one makes affective investments in what amount to fantasies. We are told that if we practice mindfulness, and get our inidual lives in order, we can be happy and secure. It is therefore implied that stable employment, home ownership, social mobility, career success and equality will naturally follow. We are also promised that we can gain self-mastery, controlling our minds and emotions so we can thrive and flourish amid the vagaries of capitalism.As Joshua Eisen, the author of Mindful Calculations, puts it: “Like kale, acai berries, gym memberships, vitamin water, and other new year’s resolutions, mindfulness indexes a profound desire to change, but one premised on a fundamental reassertion of neoliberal fantasies of self-control and unfettered agency.” We just have to sit in silence, watching our breath, and wait. It is doubly cruel because these normative fantasies of the “good life” are already crumbling under neoliberalism, and we make it worse if we focus inidually on our feelings. Neglecting shared vulnerabilities and interdependence, we disimagine the collective ways we might protect ourselves. And despite the emptiness of nurturing fantasies, we continue to cling to them.Mindfulness isn’t cruel in and of itself. It’s only cruel when fetishised and attached to inflated promises. It is then, as Berlant points out, that “the object that draws your attachment actively impedes the aim that brought you to it initially”. The cruelty lies in supporting the status quo while using the language of transformation. This is how neoliberal mindfulness promotes an inidualistic vision of human flourishing, enticing us to accept things as they are, mindfully enduring the ravages of capitalism.Adapted from McMindfulness: How Mindfulness Became the New Capitalist Spirituality by Ronald Purser, published by Repeater Books on 9 July and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da56b17291d42534ff2424bc708c7c2bb6448fd9/0_91_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f2eae2f16cd4c13a3ddbaae1473c67c","title":"apple cores down sofa slugs in sink messy childhood max liu","story":"Growing up, my parents’ home was filthy. Could I ever learn to love housework? Last Christmas, while I was visiting my parents at the house where I grew up, I watched Mum throw away some spice mix. Much of it missed the bin and the seeds, spices and herbs scattered about the kitchen floor. Mum didn’t notice, or didn’t care, so I grabbed a dustpan and brush. As I swept, I found plenty more down there: breadcrumbs, cheese, ham, porridge, dog hair, something sticky. Later, Mum mixed cocktails. I had come prepared, so, before taking a sip, I whipped a baby wipe from my pocket and gave my glass a surreptitious clean. Mum and my stepdad started talking about their plans to become Airbnb hosts, at which point I nearly choked on a cashew nut. They simply can’t see mess, I thought, and then I remembered that, until quite recently, neither could I.When I was growing up, the house was always untidy. There were piles of clothes on the landing, toys all over the living room, black marks on the hall tiles where coal had fallen from the scuttle we lugged in from the shed, dust on the surfaces, apple cores stuffed down the back of the sofa, discarded crisp packets, breakfast bowls on the coffee table, yellow gunge on the kitchen radio, and entire rooms we couldn’t enter because the doors were blocked shut by stacks of furniture, sculpture, paintings. I didn’t care: mess was all I knew, although there were hair-raising moments, such as when I was washing the dishes and saw something orange working its way up through the plughole. It turned out to be two slugs that had somehow got into the overflow. One Christmas, I accused the dog of having nibbled a bar of chocolate under the tree: “It was probably a rat,” said Mum, casually.Nowadays, I share a flat with my wife Lucy, and I’m tidy – perhaps obsessively so. As I scrub the floors and put things away after a meal, or use the vacuum’s special nozzle to suck up far-flung specks of dust on Sunday mornings, I think about how the untidiness I grew up in has affected important areas of my life – my studies, work, relationships. I’m nervous of broaching this subject with Mum, as I don’t want her to think I have complaints about my upbringing (I don’t). When I eventually ask her about it, Mum laughs and quotes my dad’s parting shot from 1988: “It would have been easier to stay if I’d been able to find a clean teaspoon.”Then she recalls a Friday evening when she took my brother Casper and me out for fish and chips: “I left the radio playing, the lights on, front door unlocked. When we got home, two neighbours were coming down the stairs. They said, ‘Thank goodness you’re alive.’ They thought the house had been ransacked and some terrible In Cold Blood-type scenario had happened. But the house was just in its usual state.”Mum also reminds me that, as a child, I liked looking at estate agents’ ads, particularly for new-build bungalows. “You wanted a house like Gary and Kevin’s,” she says of the charismatic twins at my school, who lived in a spotless beige house on a cul-de-sac. It’s true, I envied Gary and Kevin, but I thought that was because they were good at football. I never thought it was about tidiness. And anyway, when Kevin came to do some plastering at our house last year, he told Mum: “I used to love coming here as a kid.”On the other hand, I remember times when I did feel self-conscious about our home. A sleepover had to be abandoned when an asthmatic friend reacted to the dust. Another mate came for tea, refused to eat anything and the next day at school said our house was “scruffy”. We had a fight about that, so I must have been hurt. But we made up and, throughout the summer holidays, went fishing together and came back to my house at lunchtime, traipsing mud and pond water inside, to eat the sandwiches that Mum made for us.A few miles outside St Ives in Cornwall, the house was never squalid and remains full of colour, warmth and books. It’s a nice place to be. During the festive period, guests come over almost every evening for elaborate dinners and sit around the table long into the night, laughing, arguing and drinking mum’s damson gin. The living room walls are papered in Ordnance Survey maps of places of personal significance – north London, where Lucy and I lived Yorkshire, where we both studied Barcelona, where Casper lives, and various sites of my parents’ own formative years. The maps overlap, creating a disorienting family geography, while the flickering fire casts shadows across them. But why exactly has the house always been such a mess?Mum, a 68-year-old painter, sees it simply. “I could always think of something better to do than cleaning up,” she says. “It’s fruitless, completely non-creative. Tidiness is about fear of letting yourself go, but I think letting yourself go is when you can really be yourself. Both my husbands were useless about housework – but while women are judged for being untidy, men never are.”Did she ever feel embarrassed when people came over? “I hated it when they turned up unexpectedly. Certain friends always arrived when I’d just set something on fire.”So how exactly did I learn to be clean and tidy?I ask my university housemate, Will, for his memories of the year we spent living together. “I’m amused to hear you say you’ve become obsessive about cleanliness,” he says. “I’m not sure you even knew what cleaning was. I remember after about three months, I discovered you dragging the bins through to the front of the house, juice dribbling on to the hall carpet. You didn’t know the bins were collected out the back, because until then I had taken them out every single week.”The following year, I moved back into university halls, in part because Will warned a potential flatmate that I was a nightmare to live with. I felt ashamed when I heard about that, but by then I’d started seeing Lucy.The first time Lucy came to my room, I explained that I only had one cup, so we would have to take it in turns to have tea. I had never washed this cup I figured I was the only one to use it, so – why bother? Fifteen years later, I remind Lucy of this and she says, “I didn’t drink the tea because the cup was disgusting. It was calcified brown, like a toilet bowl in a manky pub.”Still, Lucy enjoyed my company enough to see past the mug and we moved in together after graduation. Apparently I hadn’t improved. “It’s true that you didn’t see mess,” she says. “You moved through rooms, only seeing what function things had for you. You’d go in the bathroom, leave the toilet seat up, your towel on the floor.”Is that so bad?“I had to teach you basic things. I couldn’t understand why you were so ill-equipped for life. When I was a kid we took turns washing and drying after dinner. I learned lifelong skills, but also a lot of conversation with my parents and siblings happened around domestic chores.”What did she think the first time she visited my parents’ house? “I loved the jolliness, the friendliness, the colour. But I was taken aback by the dirt. I grew up in suburbia and knew people who kept plastic covers on their sofas. Your mum’s cooking was amazing, but the plates had congealed food stuck to them from the previous time they were used. The wine glasses were greasy.”Like Mum, I could always think of something better than housework to do. In our early years together, I’d tell Lucy to leave it, but she refused and ended up doing it herself. When I mention this to Alison Pike, a psychology professor at Sussex University, and co-author of a study about household chaos, she says: “If you don’t care about housework, you’re just not going to be the one who does it. Caring about stuff is gendered. There’s an argument to say that, instead of bellyaching about how men should do more housework, women should just stop doing it.” This is, in effect, what Mum did – her husbands did no housework and she refused to do much herself. (She did all the cooking once, when she was unwell, my stepdad made her a cheese sandwich which turned out to be a chunk of parmesan between slices of stale bread.)Circumstance forced me to take responsibility about five years ago, when Lucy started a job involving a long commute at the same time as I began working from home. I got quite good at cooking, which meant keeping the kitchen clean. I began to enjoy doing little things like sweeping crumbs or chopped herbs from the floor after dinner, polishing the hob with French lavender spray, wiping the wall behind the cooker, bleaching the sink after washing up and never leaving anything on the worktops lest we get mice. It’s rewarding, the nightly sense of completion involved in making things gleam, and Lucy says it’s a relief to know she no longer has to do everything. Although part of me can’t help but feel like I’m wiping away a connection to my past with every swish of the sponge.Today, my brother Casper is a chef, so he knows all about keeping kitchens immaculate. I’m curious to know what he’s like at home and how he remembers the house we grew up in. He Skypes me from Barcelona, where he lives with his partner Nici and their two small children.“I don’t think our house being untidy upset me,” he says. “I didn’t find it embarrassing when friends came over. My first girlfriend used to say, ‘Oh, I like it – it’s homely.’”Do Casper and Nici argue about housework? “We used to,” he says. “And maybe I was more relaxed about it than Nici. To solve it we hired a cleaner.”When Nici joins the conversation, I sense she feels more strongly. “Little things I don’t understand,” she says to Casper. “You open a chocolate bar and throw the wrapper into the sink. Why? And I don’t like it when you leave the food that falls from the children’s plates under the table.”“It sounds like we still have issues,” he says, before adding: “I guess I’m fairly comfortable in mess at home.”I want to know how far back the legacy of messiness goes, so I ask Mum what her childhood home was like. “My mum was always cleaning,” she says, “but she didn’t pass on her domestic skills. I think she wanted something different for me, but I probably took that on too wholeheartedly. I feel guilty about not passing on any domestic skills, especially now that you have become very domesticated. Your flat is a nest kept perfect. Would you have liked it more if we’d been very tidy when you were growing up?”I’m inclined to say no, but I know my untidiness cost me when I left home, and possibly earlier. At school, teachers said I was bright but disorganised in my written work. I’m a slow learner, which might have something to do with being untidy, and for a long time I felt as though my body was marked with some indelible dirt.It took me decades to learn that my untidiness was taking its toll on me and on others around me. But blaming Mum would be unfair. As Casper says, “She made up for it in other ways.” Mum created a stimulating, loving home and, like the mess in the house, our family relationships are out in the open – imperfect, and I think more beautiful for being so. Still, my dad and stepdad should have done a lot more housework. Later, Casper and I should have helped. Perhaps it’s not too late, although I am alarmed to hear that, if the Airbnb plans get off the ground, my stepdad is planning to make breakfast for the guests.

So this is the last you’ll hear from me for a few months. Who will I rant to every week? Will the baby want to hear my thoughts on politics? If his or her first word is “Trump”, we’ll all know whose fault that is.I’ve been pregnant a bunch of times now: once with twins, now with one baby, plus assorted miscarriages and an abortion along the way. And what I’ve learned from what I think of as my 360-degree experience of pregnancy is that it is a lot like flying economy on a long-haul flight. It is so all-consuming, exhausting and uncomfortable that you can’t actually believe it will ever be over. But then it is you walk away and never think about it again, because the ultimate destination is a lot more interesting than the journey.But some people feel differently. Pregnancy is no longer merely something to be endured, but a statement about aspirational femininity. Where once just making it through the day without vomiting in my hair was enough, now I’m supposed to wonder if the oils I’m rubbing on my stomach are organic, and how cute my bump looks in my lingerie selfies. Because pregnancy has entered the Instagram era.This spring I was – I say this euphemistically – feeling the effects of pregnancy. This means I was – non-euphemistically – constantly nauseous and insane with fatigue. My pallor was more grey than glowing and any healthcare professional who asked how “mama” was doing was greeted with growls neither human nor animal. One day, as I was wondering if I should puke then eat another slice of bread or vice versa, an email arrived. “Deliciously Ella shares all of her pregnancy secrets,” it read. Deliciously Ella, AKA Ella Mills, is the wildly successful so-called “healthy-eating inspirer”, whose nutritional advice includes the theory that “to really thrive” we should cut out dairy, gluten, meat, fish and eggs. I read on, eager to thrive like the pregnant influencer: “Her morning routine includes a 7am yoga practice with breakfast being a berry and spinach smoothie with rice milk, almond butter and hemp seeds,” the email informed me. “Ella is curbing any cravings by enjoying fresh lemon on artichokes and healthy carbohydrates.”OMG! Just like me! As long as you substitute “artichokes with lemon juice” for “sweets with more sweets”. And does eating an entire loaf of sourdough between breakfast (bread) and lunch (more bread) count as “healthy carbohydrates”?It’s entirely possible that I felt so gross precisely because I wasn’t doing pregnancy the Deliciously Ella way. But how was I supposed to fit in yoga around my busy morning schedule of being sick? And I can tell you, making myself a glass of green sludge afterwards would not have helped.Like Mills, model Miranda Kerr has been documenting her photogenic pregnancy on Instagram. All the cliches of pregnancy-by-social-media are ticked off: laughably ascetic meals of toast, tomato and cucumber, exercise videos, “essential” beauty products that she is shilling, gently lit photos of her perfectly compact stomach being held by her adoring husband. Her clothes remain unblemished, even though it is scientifically impossible to eat during pregnancy without spilling at least half on your stomach. My maternity clothes are a homage to Jackson Pollock’s oeuvre, recreated in spaghetti sauce and baked beans, two foods oddly absent from pregnant influencers’ social media accounts.For a while I developed an indefensible fascination with the yoga teacher Hilaria Baldwin, AKA Mrs Alec Baldwin, whose enthusiasm for photographing herself in her lingerie remains undimmed four children down the line. “My purpose here is to normalie the postpartum figure,” she wrote under one such selfie, and if by normalise she means “suggest someone can have the body of a model hours after giving birth” then she succeeded. There is, it seems, a fine line between a woman inspiring other women in a thrillingly modern way, and a woman promoting her brand by perpetuating extremely conventional standards of beauty.Part of me admires anyone who can turn pregnancy into yet another product of our consumerist and patriarchal society, endorsing the idea that being 38-weeks pregnant is no reason not to be photogenic and high-achieving. But a much, much bigger part of me believes the kindest thing you can do for women is tell them the unfiltered truth. Nothing reveals the gap between social-media fantasy and reality more strikingly than pregnancy, so Amy Schumer has been an overdue antidote to all of the above. Throughout her pregnancy and since giving birth to her son last month, the US comic has been posting images of what motherhood actually looks like, in all its laughably undignified glory. “Guys what are we doing tonight?” she wrote beneath a photo in which she wears a customised nursing bra while attached to two breast pumps.I’ll meet you there, Schumer. And I’ll see the rest of you in the autumn.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

Currently, one in four UK workers have an account with Nest.Nest says it has not taken this decision lightly, “but we don’t think it makes sense to continue investing in an industry whose business model looks increasingly unsustainable”. It already has a tobacco-free policy on a couple of its funds.Commenting on the announcement, Dean Walker, a scheme member based in Portsmouth, says: “I’m a new dad and I’ll certainly be encouraging my daughter not to smoke when she grows up. Everyone knows it’s not good for you and can cause cancers, which I feel very strongly against.“I think what Nest are doing is a great idea and I hope more companies follow suit.”In 2017 it emerged that Nest was shifting a chunk of its investments into a new climate change fund designed to move people’s money out of fossil fuels and into renewable energy. It said it wanted to protect members from the risks associated with the climate emergency by reducing their exposure to companies with reserves of coal, oil and gas.It is predicted that by the late 2020s, one-third of the UK working population will have a pension pot with Nest. The average income of a member is around £18,000 a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5e7aa861ddb730e8c2b5f0b9f2225940e47833d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73cb7357ea6afc3019f22339b5c0894d","title":"letting fees ban agents urge landlords to increase rents","story":"The government has banned agencies from ripping off tenants – but there is evidence that rents are rising to offset the lossesThere were warnings that this month’s ban on rip-off tenant fees would result in rents being pushed up – and now  Money can reveal this is already starting to happen.Just two weeks after the ban came into force, a north London lettings agent has started telling its landlords to raise all future rents by £20 a month to offset the new costs they face. And it is unlikely to be alone in proposing such a measure.The move, which was this week branded by one landlord as “not in the spirit of the law”, had been predicted by some commentators, though few thought it would happen this quickly.Letting agent body Arla Propertymark warned in May that rents would rise by £103 a year as agents and landlords sought to recoup lost revenue. It now expects other agents to quickly follow suit, it said this week.At the start of June the government outlawed the £300-plus admin fees, the £100 credit-check fees and a host of often ludicrous charges that had become the bane of tenants’ lives. They could easily add £600-£800 to the upfront cost of renting a property. While tenant groups celebrated the ban, it was accompanied by threats from the property industry that rents would have to rise.It emerged this week that award-winning London letting agent Simon Clarke has been writing to its landlords with the increased rent proposal. The company, which has been in business since 1991 and has offices in Finchley and Whetstone, is to start charging landlords £240 for credit and other checks – on top of its existing fees. Prior to the ban, it charged tenants £432 for the same service. An online tenant credit check can be done for about £20.The letter seen by Money states: “Assuming you would like us to continue to fully reference and credit check prospective new tenants as and when your property becomes available, we need to inform you that an additional admin charge of £200 plus VAT known as a ‘tenancy set-up fee’ will be levied … and in addition to the letting fee. This is to cover the cost of this essential referencing service moving forward and shall include the right to rent immigration checks.”The landlord who contacted us to reveal Simon Clarke’s letter says he will resist the agent’s move to increase the rent. “I don’t think this is in the spirit of the legislation. There is little transparency in the fees, and I have little idea of how much the letting agents actually pay for credit checks, referencing etc. I’d rather that I, as a landlord, bear the brunt of these charges, not the tenant,” he says.A spokesperson for Simon Clarke told Money: “With the introduction of the tenant fees ban, we have had to pass on our costs for setting up a tenancy. In this time of increased regulation, particularly the recent rises in landlord taxation, we have advised our clients on how to ensure they can still cover the costs of their rental properties.”The agent also asked Arla chief executive David Cox to speak to us. “When the ban came in, we warned that rents would rise on average by £103 a year. What we have seen this week is what we predicted would happen … This is set to happen across the board,” he said.Cox pointed to research undertaken for Arla by the consultancy Capital Economics that revealed the fees ban is set to cost letting agents £200m a year, and landlords £300m. It also claimed that 4,000 letting agent jobs could be lost.Dan Wilson Craw, director at campaign group Generation Rent, says it is interesting that this agent is not attempting to pass on to landlords the full £432 sum it used to charge tenants.“Existing tenants aren’t affected – rightly, because there are no costs involved when there’s no change to whose name is on the contract,” he says. “As for the attempt to increase rent by £20 a month, whether this is possible depends entirely on the wider market – a shortage of homes sees rents go up anyway, but if the landlord is competing with newly built flats, they might struggle to get new tenants in at the higher rent.”In January the  reported that rents across Britain fell in 2018 for the first time in a decade, after years of inflation-busting rises. Figures from the Deposit Protection Service – a government-backed group that supervises tenancy deposits – showed that the average rent fell by £9 – from £774 in 2017 to £765.Reduced demand from tenants in places such as London, in part due to Brexit, was cited as a factor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e87dc506d483a10e5cd742451e8265f3d22c6596/0_143_5345_3207/master/5345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f3cae127a80cef856301cea12d10c1f","title":"what can i do to get rid of a moth infestation","story":"I need a cost-effective solution that doesn’t involve toxic chemicalsEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.Like many others seemingly, we have a huge problem with moths infesting our house.

But the Labour leader is facing a pincer movement from both sides of his deeply ided party.Another Europe is Possible, the anti-Brexit campaign group that works closely with leftwing Labour MPs including Clive Lewis and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, has announced that it plans a “summer of resistance”.Alena Ivanova, from the group, said: “What we’re witnessing this summer is the growth of a mass and plural movement against Brexit, with mass demonstrations announced for both July and October, and lots of different organisations holding speaker tours and preparing for a referendum.”She added: “But this movement needs to be radical, both tactically and politically – it has to become a hot summer of resistance, willing to disrupt the status quo.”Meanwhile Tom Watson, Corbyn’s deputy, has continued to push for a People’s Vote, and will make a major speech on the issue on Monday.Recriminations from the party’s poll performance have continued. Some shadow ministers, including some on the left, lament what one called the “malign influence” of Corbyn’s advisers, in particular his key confidant, Seumas Milne, and chief of staff, Karie Murphy, complaining that the pair insulate Corbyn from criticism and challenge.Several shadow cabinet members have told the  that Corbyn himself was uncomfortable with the party’s message in the run-up to the European elections, which he felt was insufficiently clear.“They’re clearly under pressure: I don’t think he’s happy with the way it’s working,” one said. Another claimed: “Even Jeremy, who has always held Seumas in awe, is increasingly dissatisfied with the messaging”.The shadow cabinet was not consulted about the expulsion of former New Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell for publicly admitting he had voted Lib Dem at the European elections. “No politician was involved in that decision,” said one senior party source.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was said by allies to have been particularly irked about Campbell’s expulsion, fearing it made the leadership look vindictive.The decision to drop shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry from prime minister’s questions at short notice last week, after she spoke out about Labour’s Brexit policy, also raised eyebrows.Corbyn was lambasted by colleagues at Monday’s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP), with one veteran of the Blair and Brown eras saying it was the worst they had witnessed, with Corbyn reading from a prepared script and failing to take on hecklers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57af62abd60cfe4974f44d748f4a9bc41c1bdba8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d9a8b3a1102280e292121059f041ab","title":"change uk how not to set up a political party podcast","story":"With six of its 11 MPs having quit, Heather Stewart, the ’s political editor, charts what went wrong.

His first delivery is worked away behind square for four and there’s only one dot thereafter. 30th over: Australia 159-2 (Finch 93, Smith 22) Australia’s counterpunch prompts the return of Malinga back into the attack and he delivers a boundaryless over, one full of those shots from Smith that look suicidal - stepping to off and uncovering his pegs - but end in easy ones and twos. Peter Salmon again: “To Paul Griffin - I am a copy-editor, and hate the hyphen too. Unfortunately it is still standard in most style guides, so I tend to use it, but the hyphen in general is slowly being excised from the English language, retained only in cases where there is a possible ambiguity, which I don’t think there is in copy-editor. I’ve unilaterally decided to get rid of all hyphens in ‘-ly’ words for instance, eg. newly-wed - the ‘-ly’ makes it obvious the second word is modified by the first. We can all make a small difference.”29th over: Australia 152-2 (Finch 91, Smith 18) Intent is such an interesting phenomenon in cricket. Australia began with lots of it then watched it ebb away, but since Steve Smith came out it’s returned again. After upping the ante in previous minutes the big over arrives, Finch taking de Silva to task for 4,6,6, in a rare flurry of brute force. Quite why Australia allowed themselves to be so becalmed for that spell remains a mystery, especially when Finch shows such control with his hitting. 28th over: Australia 132-2 (Finch 73, Smith 17) Michaels Clarke and Slater are on commentary together. In the blink of an eye the subject turns to Bon Jovi. That chat is mercifully cut short by Smith’s intent converting to four runs with a well-timed square drive. Udana is again the bowler to concede runs.27th over: Australia 124-2 (Finch 71, Smith 11) Smith is starting to work through the gears, hustling and shuffling like a toddler ready for the loo. De Silva’s accuracy restricts Australia to singles but there’s a change of vibe out in the middle after that long spell of Sri Lankan control. 26th over: Australia 119-2 (Finch 69, Smith 9) Udana’s back into the attack but he sends down the first over in an age that Australia find easy to score from, Smith in particular getting into line early and showing intent. The highlight is a whip to midwicket for four that he took from around off stump after stepping a mile to off to the left-arm over bowler. Paul Griffin’s joined in: “Forgive the impertinent pedantry but are we sure that “copy-editor” should be hyphenated? I’m on Greek beach and have neglected to pack a style guide. This also explains the mauve swimwear, with which the locals remain unwowed (or possibly un-wowed?).”25th over: Australia 110-2 (Finch 67, Smith 2) Any thoughts of that mighty hit breaking the shackles are quickly dashed by de Silva’s sixth over and his latest demonstration of control on a two-paced surface. “I would just like to point out to Bill Pairman that not all dells are dingly. Some, at least, are bosky.” Thanks Martin Wright. 24th over: Australia 108-2 (Finch 66, Smith 1) This is a splendid duel between Pradeep and Finch. The bowler has enjoyed the upper hand for a while now and again challenges Australia’s skipper but the over ends with Finch pulling hard to a delivery outside the line of off stump that bounced grille-high. He connected superbly and the ball soared behind square leg for a much needed six.  “Splendid stuff from Peter Salmon,” commends Brian Withington. “I found myself wanting to see ‘spittle’ (partner, ‘lick’) amongst his list of fossilbinomial words but not sure if it qualifies? His reference to once in an era words had me segueing to the sort of (very) occasional bowler that you let loose just once in a competition, probably in the grand final when the chips are down, introduced ominously by the umpire as ‘right arm, hapax legomenon’.”All that pressure has earned another wicket, and another for de Silva. Khawaja looked to break the shackles, slog-sweeping firmly but straight into the hands of the midwicket sweeper. 22nd over: Australia 97-1 (Finch 56, Khawaja 10) Sri Lanka are now well on top of this passage of play and Pradeep is all over Australia, appealing unsuccessfully for an edge against Khawaja then whistling one through Finch’s unconvincing pull before testing Khawaja’s reflexes with a slippery lifter. 21st over: Australia 95-1 (Finch 55, Khawaja 9) Brendon McCullum on commentary has mentioned how the Oval can exhibit “spongy” bounce on occasion and it does appear that may be a factor in Australia’s declining run-rate. Especially against spin the ball is just holding up or popping up, forcing the batsmen to check their drives and reconsider any abandon. “I refer John Starbuck (over 17) to oxforddictionaries: In the phrase wrought havoc, as in they wrought havoc on the countryside, wrought is an archaic past tense of work and is not, as is sometimes assumed, a past tense of wreak.” Thanks, Andy Killeen. 20th over: Australia 93-1 (Finch 54, Khawaja 8) Sensing an opportunity to strike Karunaratne recalls Pradeep and it so nearly does the trick. The opener begins his second spell by beating Khawaja’s outside edge, then he finds a thick edge next ball before the normal service of tight lines and watchful batting resumes. Ok, so I’ve been out of my depth with all this wordplay for a while, but this from Dom Cole might have tipped me into delirium. “Surely it should be hapax legomena and not hapax legomenons. Though There are perhaps different criterions to support the other point of view.”19th over: Australia 87-1 (Finch 53, Khawaja 3) More of the same: decent bowling, conservative batting, and de Silva restricts Australia to four singles. My favourite OBO emailing homonym Matt Dony is around. “Calling back to Ian Forth’s musings on nouns that are followed by their adjective, I once ‘enjoyed’ a lively debate about ‘Gins and tonic’ vs ‘Gin and tonics.’ I guess it all comes down to how you treat the word ‘tonic’. If it is an abbreviation of ‘Tonic water’, then that’s where the plural sits. But if it’s being used in terms of its effect on the gin, that it acts as a tonic to the gin, then ‘Gin’ gets the S. Either way, it wroted havoc on the bar order.” 18th over: Australia 83-1 (Finch 51, Khawaja 1) Aaron Finch shrugs off the loss of his opening partner to reach his third half-century of this World Cup. He looked superbly early on but has since been becalmed. Australia really have relinquished the impetus here. It may be decent bowling, it may be the pitch becoming a tad two-paced once the hardness of the new ball has disappeared, but there’s a diminishing amount of intent on display at the crease.Brian Withington again: “Apparently ‘havoc’ is a military order permitting seizure of goods after victory, as in Mark Antony’s call of ‘Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war’. A good rallying call in the dressing room before unleashing a pack of fast bowlers on a lively green top. By the way, I think Mark (Charles Jefford) Nicholas could just about pull off the Mr Darcy role in the commentary box.”17th over: Australia 80-1 (Finch 49, Khawaja 0) No messing around today, Khawaja is in at three.John Starbuck’s returned, drawing a line from Richard I to Buffy, as you do. “‘Time immemorial’ is a well-established legal phrase, used to refer to English statute law dating from the reign of Richard I. This is an inaccurate credit to Richard, who didn’t much care for England except as a money source for fighting wars, but leaves out his father Henry II who pulled together and created the foundations of our current legal set-up. Also, I don’t much care for ‘wreaked’ as a past tense. It probably comes from American usage, who are notoriously poor at handling irregular verbs. An early episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer demonstrates this, with Anthony Head having to say ‘slayed’ should be used instead of ‘slain’ while it was in the script and he didn’t have much choice, he should still be thoroughly ashamed.”Sri Lanka have been tightening the tourniquet slowly over a number of overs and it finally pays idends. Australia’s openers have been content working ones and twos against some solid bowling but the moment Warner looks to improvise he’s undone. Stepping back and across he gives himself room to cut de Silva but doesn’t pick the quicker arm ball that skids through and sends the zing bails skywards. Excellent bowling from the spinner and a reward for a long spell of patient cricket from Sri Lanka.16th over: Australia 79-0 (Warner 26, Finch 48) Another solid over from Perera and Sri Lanka. It’s been a while since we saw a boundary. The bowlers are landing in good areas and the batters are respecting it. Tidy cricket. 15th over: Australia 76-0 (Warner 25, Finch 46) Time for spin with Dhananjaya de Silva brought on from the Vauxhall end and it’s a promising start, especially to Warner with the right-arm bowler coming around the wicket and making a couple misbehave, forcing rare false shots. Nothing of great alarm for the batsmen, but in the context of their serene progress so far worth keeping a close eye on. David Farrelly must be tired or wired. “It is 4:15 ish am here in the Rockies so apologies if I lower the tenor of the conversation but didn’t Titus Andronicus invoke the gods to send down justice to wreak our wrongs? Or was that Shane Warne?” I think Warnie was sent down to tweak our wrong’uns wasn’t he? Boom and indeed tish. Try the veal. 14th over: Australia 73-0 (Warner 24, Finch 44) Sri Lanka are enjoying a decent spell with Udana and Perera after Australia’s confident start. Length has been key and Perera is again in the right areas, restricting Warner and Finch to a diet of singles. 13th over: Australia 69-0 (Warner 22, Finch 42) Udana continues his tidy spell. Nothing fancy going on, just consistent line and length keeping Australia honest. The grammar chat really has got you all interested, hasn’t it? Back to Peter Salmon: “Being a copy-editor, I’m enjoying the word chat as much as the cricket. What you’ve got with ‘wreakhavoc’ is a binomial. ‘Dingly’ is a fossil word - one which only occurs in one context (often in a binomial) - other examples include bygones, champing, eke, fettle, fro, kith, petard, riddance, shebang, spick and yore - I won’t supply the context. Then of course there is the rare hapax legomenon - words which appear only once in a era, community, text or oeuvre - Shakespeare only ever used ‘satyr’ once. There’s about 400 hapax legomenons in the Hebrew Bible, and they get acsribed a fair bit of significance in that Hebrew Bible sort of way.” We should OBO Countdown sometime. 12th over: Australia 63-0 (Warner 21, Finch 37) Better from Perera, including that very tight LBW appeal. An over of heavily bowled length deliveries that Australia are happy in the main to play from the crease with angled bats in search of ones and twos behind square.One of the joys of the OBO is unearthing the likes of Nick Cherkas. “The term is “collocation” words which are frequently found together. The example of “wreak havoc” is a strong collocation, as those words are, as we’ve seen, good mates. Collocations are great fun and, for those learning English, arguably more important to be aware of than grammatical rules. They help in building vocabulary, as in “slip fielder” (a strong collocation) and “maiden over” (a fairly strong collocation).”It looked optimistic in real time but it was much closer than I expected on review. Perera struck Finch’s front pad on the press forward and the ball was going on to hit the stumps but the batsman was saved by umpire’s call for contact point outside the line of off stump. Perera calls for a review of an LBW shout against Finch that was declined onfield...11th over: Australia 57-0 (Warner 20, Finch 35) Udana again does well, landing his left-arm over pace on a decent length around a testing fourth stump line. However, there is no indication Australia will lose a wicket any time soon. 10th over: Australia 53-0 (Warner 17, Finch 34) It’s a double change for Sri Lanka with Perera entering the attack but he is popgun to Finch on a surface this true. The Aussie skipper tucks in, hitting sweetly and with poise through the line of the ball to collect fours through the covers and point. I’ve never seen Finch bat better than this. He could end with 200+.“Thinking of havoc and that mighty cricketing legend The Judge. I am put in mind not so much the havoc wrought by Robin Smith back in the day as the havoc wrought by that bloody Ray Illingworth, who if memory serves me correctly was the self styled supremo of English cricket who did so little for so many England players. I am thinking Tuffnell, Malcolm, Smith, Hick, Ramprakash well all those who played during that era. Illingworth was such a self righteous known all, I think he managed to get the worst out of a lot of teams and players. He wroak a whole load of havoc.” Gah! Thanks for the PTSD flashback Charlie Jeffery. 9th over: Australia 44-0 (Warner 16, Finch 26) Udana has recovered well enough from his early injury to join the attack and he begins smartly, restricting Australia’s openers to just a single.  Brian Withington is in the building. “Ian Forth’s splendid literary references to Isa Guha had me wandering further back and idly picturing a Pride and Prejudice mash up in the commentary box, with Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy exchanging zingers during the high tea interval. Expertly acerbic analysis laced with smoulderingly repressed sexual tension - what’s not to like?” I can picture it now... Darcy: “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me - outside off stump.”8th over: Australia 43-0 (Warner 15, Finch 26) Australia are turning the screw here, presenting the full face of the bat to every delivery, selecting their shots well, and playing with that puffed out chest masculinity that so intimidates opponents. Warner converts that equation into four runs off Pradeep’s first delivery, crunching it square, then he and Finch rotate the strike with ease. Finch does so holding every shot long after the ball has entered the fielding side’s purview in another intimidatory display of body language. Back to words with - and without - friends...“Immemorial prefers to hang out with ‘time’ in the vocabulary playground,” offers Ian Forth, “but also allows us to pivot to adjectives that come after their nouns. See also ‘court martial’, ‘poet laureate’ and ‘attorney general’. A lesser man than me would make a cheap joke about David Warner and ‘something fishy’ but fortunately I’m better than that.”“I would like to point out that I am pretty sure that the past tense of “wreak havoc” is surely “wreaked havoc” ! As in Botham wreaked havoc against Australia in 1981.” Thanks Ralph Jennings (but don’t forget Bob). 7th over: Australia 33-0 (Warner 8, Finch 25) Yet another sumptuous straight drive for four from Finch who is timing the ball gloriously this morning. Malinga responds by moving around the wicket in an effort to force the Australian skipper to play outside his V. Finch declines the offer, drilling another four straight through mid-off who - to misquote an old World Cup goals video I once had - was as much use as a lace curtain interrupting the path of a bullet.6th over: Australia 23-0 (Warner 8, Finch 15) Better from Pradeep who lands an over on a tight line and length to keep Australia honest. Some quick housekeeping: the pitch is doing nothing, and neither is the ball. “I think ‘wreak’ is very happy to work with ‘vengeance’ as well as ‘havoc’” emails Tim Wiseman. Is it just me or did reading that provoke the image of Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction in everyone?5th over: Australia 20-0 (Warner 6, Finch 14) Another tight Malinga over respected by Australia’s openers. The only delivery of note was a slower ball that just held up on the surface and forced a checked drive from Warner that almost induced a c\u0026ampb. Isuru Udana is back on the field. “As an Indian born in this century, I experienced neither the pleasure of watching Robin Smith live nor the pain of witnessing yet another Indian bowling attack getting pummeled all around the ground in the 90s,” emails Abhijato Sensarma. “But I have watched highlights featuring Mr Smith in the past, and the one you have provided today solidifies my opinion: he was rather good.” Delighted you agree. As I’ve mentioned before he was one of my first cricketing idols and his yellow bat grip was the first item of cricketing equipment I selected to emulate a professional. Unfortunately I was, and remain, cack with bat in hand. 4th over: Australia 17-0 (Warner 4, Finch 13) The ball is finding the middle of Finch’s bat regularly, and most of the time with the kind of timing normally associated with Deontay Wilder and another man’s jaw. Pradeep does some excellent fielding off his own bowling to deny another on-driven four but there’s nothing he can do with a boundary clipped forward of midwicket. Isuru Udana did his best trying to haul that shot in before the rope but he failed, and in doing so ed headlong into the LCD advertising boards, jarring his left shoulder in the process. He has now left the field in some discomfort. 3rd over: Australia 12-0 (Warner 4, Finch 8) In a sign of Warner’s new-found maturity he’s happy to allow Malinga to sling down a maiden, respecting the line and length and his inability to pierce the infield with those meaty defensive-ish strokes of his. “Another interesting aspect of ‘wreaking havoc’ is that there is no proper past tense,” emails John Starbuck. “You have to use ‘wrought havoc’ or adopt versions of ‘play havoc (with)‘. Havoc is obviously a difficult customer.” 2nd over: Australia 12-0 (Warner 4, Finch 8) Goodness me, how’s the touch from Aaron Finch!? First delivery of the day from Nuwan Pradeep is on a decent line and length but the Aussie skipper stands tall and caresses a textbook off drive on the up for four: think vintage Michael Vaughan. Four balls later he times another sweet sweet boundary, this one driven with the full face of the bat past the non-striker in a stroke that Finch holds for so long it looks as though the wind has caught him and he might never change. This would actually be fine because it was such a glorious follow through to a perfect on drive. “Nice shout out for words with only one friend” emails Bill Pairman. “My favourite is “dingly dell” which works both ways. The only dingly thing is a dell, all dells are dingly. They’re like an elderly couple who have been together since childhood, ever-faithful to each other, still as deeply enamoured as the day they first kissed.” Very high standard of emails this morning. High fives all round. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Warner 4, Finch 0) Malinga opens from the Vauxhall end and he begins superbly, swinging one into Warner’s pads then beating the outside edge with a length delivery. Warner is typically unfussed, clipping the next off his pads through midwicket with a firm push that races away for four like it’s hopped on an airport travelator. This is a fast outfield. Aaron Finch and David Warner are out in the middle. Lasith Malinga has the white ball in his hand. There’s plenty of blue sky among the fluffy clouds in south London. Time for cricket.If today’s lopsided looking contest fails to deliver, just wait until tomorrow...It is a match that – on the surface at least – is just one of 48 at this rain-splattered Cricket World Cup. But when India and Pakistan face off in Manchester on Sunday the sporting contest will be magnified and warped by so much else: the 70-plus years of shared history and antipathy between the two countries, the recent political tensions in Kashmir, and the stultifying pressure that comes when several hundred million eyeballs are watching on.Anthem time. A quick opportunity to inform you that today’s officials are Aleem Dar and Richard Illingworth with Michael Gough keeping his eye on DRS. “My new number one cricket journo is without doubt Isa Guha. She has the ironic air of a daughter in an Ivy Compton-Burnett novel - trapped inside a Victorian country house with her father, a tyrannical male landowner, and his bumptious son, with only her native wit and charm available to combat them.” I told you Ian Forth logging on was good, didn’t I? Isa Guha is indeed brilliant. In Australia she is often saddled with some unenviable commentary box assignments which he handles with a grace I doubt I could emulate. Just staying with The Judge a little longer, it may well contain the greatest cover quote of all time from Mike Selvey in reference to Smith’s famed Square Cut. “Should I ever be condemned to beheading, I would like Robin Smith to be the swordsman,” he wrote. Brilliant. “Pleased to see the word ‘pundit’ here,” emails Peter Salmon. “My friends and I got obsessed with the word a while ago in relation to Aussie Rules football - we loved that the pundits were always ‘being proved wrong’. Looking into the etymology it turns out pundit comes from the Sanskrit ‘pandita’, meaning a teacher of any field of knowledge in Hinduism particularly the Vedic scriptures, dahrma, Hindi philosophy, or secular subjects such as music. So it seemed eminently reasonable they didn’t know much about Aussie Rules, hence getting it wrong. More generally it means ‘knowledge owner’ and I have to say Alistair Cook’s first stint on the wireless yesterday showed him as a pretty good ‘knowledge owner.’” I haven’t heard much from the Chef so I’ll withhold judgement, but I’m delighted he’s made a good start to life behind the mic. The last time I was on here (Australia vs Pakistan) I shared that Robin Smith was one of my cricketing heroes growing up. That was in reference to a new autobiography being published about Smith’s eventful life (written with OBO guru Rob Smyth). Smith recently spoke to Donald McRae and provided a glimpse at how raw some passages of The Judge are likely to be.“What do you think about Lasit Malinga?” asks CS Pancham. “Will he cause problems for Australian batsmen?” I would expect so, yes. I think he’s a terrific bowler and ideally suited to the kinds of pitches we’ve seen so far this tournament which have benefited that two-length approach (very full or very short). He averages 24.65 against Australia in ODIs with a strike rate of two wickets per ten overs. Ian Forth has logged on, which is always an enjoyable moment on the OBO. “OB Jato makes a very pertinent point but my eye was drawn to “wreck havoc”. It’s more usually “wreak havoc” but wreak’s one of those funny words that only really likes hanging out with one friend, to wit, in its case, ‘havoc’. See also: ‘fell swoop’ Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali Teresa May and her cat.” One change also for Sri Lanka with Milinda Siriwardana replacing Suranag Lakmal. That means doubts over both Nuwan Pradeep (injured finger) and Lasith Malinga (flew home to attend funeral) have been resolved with the two bowlers making the starting line. One change to Australia’s line-up with Jason Behrendorff replacing Nathan Coulter-Nile. Finch indicated the hero of his side’s win over the Windies was a little stiff and sore. That still means a four-man pace attack with ten overs to be found from Glenn Maxwell, Aaron Finch, or even the lesser spotted Steve Smith, who was seen rolling his arm over in the nets this week. Aaron Finch called incorrectly (his fifth lost toss in a row this World Cup) and Dimuth Karunaratne wasted no time sticking Australia in. Finch agreed with the strategy suggesting he would also have bowled first to take advantage of some overcast conditions and any life in the new pitch. Want to know what the Oval’s like behind the scenes? Of course you do! And as luck would have it here’s Mark Butcher to show you around. This is also an opportunity for me to segue into nominating Butch as my favourite cricketing pundit (and your chance to email or tweet me with your alternatives - with supporting information, of course). I’ve long enjoyed his well-informed perspective on the game, his ability to move with the times, and most crucially how he argues his point confidently but respectfully in a manner that advances debate. This is a lovely read from Barney Ronay on the presence of rain during the early phase of this World Cup.Rain tells you the summer game is also about melancholy and boredom, that this is a story told often in minor chords too, its moments of colour bordered by vital passages of grey. In the current battle for the sport’s soul rain stands on one side saying this is not a product to be sold by the yard. Formats will come and go. But you have to be made to love cricket, not simply offered it up ready-made. In England, at least, the uncertainty remains. Cricket will always fight with the skies.If you missed any of yesterday’s action you can catch up here in written and audio formats. TLDR: England hammered the Windies but Roy and Morgan picked up injuries. “Sri Lanka’s pacers could wreck unlikely havoc today, but I am concerned with only one query regarding Australia right now,” emails OB Jato, “Stoinis?”. Indeed, Australia’s line-up is unbalanced without their allrounder and the selection strategy against Pakistan did not look like one capable of winning a World Cup. Marcus Stoinis remains unavailable for selection with the side strain he suffered against India but he is expected to return to training next week. Mel Jones has had a look at the pitch for Australian TV and she likes what she sees. It’s a fresh surface and Jones reckons it’ll have plenty of pace, unlike the worn tracks that have been used at the Oval so far this tournament that have lacked the venue’s customary pace and bounce. Let’s get the weather out of the way early - it’s dry, and it is forecast to remain dry for the majority of play with just the slight risk of a shower during the afternoon. It’s a bit nippy out still though with the temperature unlikely to get out of the teens while a brisk southerly will keep everyone on their toes. Hello everybody and welcome to match 20 of Cricket World Cup 2019 featuring Australia and Sri Lanka from the Oval.For Sri Lanka it’s the first in a series of intimidating must-win fixtures if they are to make the semi-finals. After suffering a hammering at the hands of a merciless New Zealand in their tournament opener Sri Lanka have endured the misfortune of consecutive washouts against Pakistan and Bangladesh, two opponents they would have fancied their chances against. Results are now required against four of the top five ranked teams in ODI cricket, starting with the defending champions.For Australia it’s a welcome chance to tinker with their sub-optimal approach before the knockout phase. The good news for Justin Langer is his big names have delivered under pressure, notably David Warner with the bat and Mitchell Starc with the ball, but the drop off in standard from the stars to the role players has been alarming. Moreover, there still appears a lack of clarity in selection and strategy leading to Usman Khawaja hovering like a bad smell in the batting order and captain Aaron Finch pressganged into lobbing down some auxiliary overs. The best of their best has largely been good enough to paper over cracks so far but the form of the other likely semi-finalists suggests improvement across the board is required for a sixth Australian triumph since 1987.Start time is 10.30am local (7.30pm AET) which means there’s plenty of time to chew the fat about all things CWC beforehand. If you would like to contribute (and like Mr Kipling’s cakes your input so far this tournament has been exceedingly good) you can send me an email or a tweet and I will do my best to add you to the coverage.

After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33b8cbf2b4f1ea33aec913329a32a0c4d432a97d/0_224_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dae56f64c8be16220fae10831aea3c82","title":"cycling round berlin wall mauerweg germany","story":"As the 30th anniversary of its fall approaches, a cycle ride along the route of the Berlin Wall reveals a once-ided city now open and welcomingIt makes for delightful cycling: dappled sunshine, a smooth path, birds in the trees. The only clue that this isn’t just any woodland trail is the height of those trees: the oaks and beeches are young, barely three metres tall.That’s because we’re riding on what, until 1989, was the “death strip” – the zone between Berlin’s inner and outer walls, filled with tripwire machine guns, trenches and dogs, and guarded by soldiers in watchtowers. This November sees the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and I’m riding stretches of the Berliner Mauerweg – the 160km trail tracing its path – to see how the city has rearranged itself in three decades.“The wall wasn’t a wall here, but a high fence.” Rainer Block, a local SPD councillor, is showing us around his patch in the south of the city. Grossziethen is as tidy and prosperous-looking a German suburb as you could imagine, which makes its history more jarring. As we ride, Rainer points out streets close to the border where only the party faithful were allowed to live, stepladders had to be locked away, and overnight guests had to be reported. A memorial tells of Horst Kullack, a 23-year-old with learning difficulties who, after a few drinks on New Year’s Eve 1971, wanted to visit his beloved grandmother in West Berlin, and was fatally shot by the guards.Here Berlin comes to an abrupt stop – fields of wheat and barley on one side and the apartment blocks of the Bauhaus Gropiusstadt on the other. Today the area is a weekend destination for cyclists and walkers, who queue excitedly outside the Moin Moin ice-cream parlour in Grossziethen (try the vivid green Waldmeister – woodruff – flavour).It’s salutary to remember that the wall was a feature of the city for less time (just over 28 years) than has now passed since it fell. Signs of the ision are being erased, and not only by nature. We see neat new family houses on stretches of the death strip – it was a boon for urban planners, says Rainer. But in some ways, the wall is still there: he points out the well-kept front garden of one of his neighbours, enclosed by a few metres of unremarkable metal mesh. “The authorities bulldozed the fence,” says Rainer, “but left the debris. This chap just recycled the materials.”Two hours’ ride west is Potsdam, with its palaces, period houses and the Glienicke bridge, which actually looks a lot less bleak than in the 2015 film Bridge of Spies. By the Jungfernsee, we bag a lakeside table at the Meierei brewery and get stuck into huge Maß (litre) glasses of beer.Also enjoying a beer are Rafael, a twentysomething Berliner, and his Brazilian girlfriend Luisa: both are both passionate about their united and outward-looking city. “There are no boundaries,” says Rafael, a microbiologist. “Friends from the former GDR might use slightly different words, but no one thinks anything of it.” Luisa, who works here for a football app, says she wouldn’t swap Berlin for anywhere. “It’s so open and welcoming – you’re as likely to hear Spanish or Portuguese in a bar as German, and many workplaces operate in English.”Rafael loves the way once forbidden or dangerous places, marked by suffering and death, have become the city’s happening areas, known for dancing and fun.We’d seen this the day before near our Airbnb flat in newly named Kreuzkölln, a lively district between trendy Kreuzburg and multicultural Neukölln, where cool organic cafes rub shoulders with cheap Syrian and Sudanese restaurants. The wall ran down its eastern edge, which made this an unpopular dead-end area before reunification, and one ripe for hipster colonisation afterwards.After 1989, many East Berliners wanted the “wall of shame” torn down and forgotten it was West Berliners mainly who fought to keep parts of it standing and its route marked – by a double row of cobbles. We follow these towards Treptow Park, with its massive, very Soviet-looking memorial to USSR soldiers who died in 1945’s Battle of Berlin, and note with amusement that, at one point, the marker cobbles disappear beneath the concrete car park of a large Aldi.Less-visited than the East Side is an informal open-air gallery in the northern, arty district of Prenzlauer Berg. At a remnant of the inner wall in the Mauerpark, we chat to street artists from Vietnam and Prague, as well as Germany, as they wield their spray cans.The Mauerweg leads from here past a poignant memorial at Bernauer Strasse, with photographs, chapel and museum, then west along residential streets. Like many cities, Berlin is growing fast, and by the Spandau ship canal the preserved Kieler Eck watchtower – where 24-year-old Günter Liftin was the first fugitive shot and killed, in 1961 – now gazes over new high-end waterside apartments.The Berlin Wall RaceA 161km run around the wall route, in an anti-clockwise direction, starting in Prenzlauer Berg. The race is sold out for runners but spectating will be great fun.• 17-18 August, 100meilen.deOderberger Straße walkUntil 1989, this was a dead-end street ending at the wall. This free walk tells tales of life on the street in the 1970s and 80s, finishing at the site of a viewing platform on the west side.• Selected Fridays and Sundays 21 June to 9 November, register at berlin@hdg.deFree music festivalThe highlight of a week’s celebration in November will be a free music festival on 9 November, with stages along the wall route featuring artists connected with the events of 198990, or who stand for a fresh start.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Look no further than new 10-part drama WhatIf (Netflix, out now). Because honestly: nobody can be watching this for the actual story.WhatIf is a high-camp drama from Mike Kelley, and like Revenge, his other glossy mega-hit also with incredible houses, it follows a formula: beautiful and intelligent genius (in this case Lisa, played by Jane Levy) and her hot-but-stupid love interest (Sean, played by Blake Jenner) go to war with a mysterious older woman – in this case billionaire businesswoman Anne Montgomery, a gorgeous, insanely camp Renée Zellweger, all pencil dresses and purring and gin martinis.Anne makes Lisa a deal: she will fund her medical research, but in return Anne gets to spend one night with Sean. The catch, aside from the big question: “Would you prostitute your husband for $80m?”, is that Sean can never tell Lisa what happened that night. If he does, Anne gets to keep Lisa’s pioneering biotech company. So far, so Indecent Proposal – but then WhatIf spins off into about 12 insane plots, all based in breathtakingly classy houses, tastefully decorated apartments and, yes, a mansion on a mountaintop only accessible by helicopter and with its own sex steam room. Beat that, Kevin McCloud.WhatIf plays out like the writers wrote each inidual episode, filmed it, went out on a bender and turned up the next day asking: “What now?” One minute it’s a sexy psychodrama, the next it’s a B-movie horror, then someone accidentally takes magic mushrooms and it’s part bargain-bin Broad City, part student art film. There are international conspiracies, a sex scene to the music of the Backstreet Boys, and at one point Renée Zellweger threatens to kill Lisa with a bow and arrow. Whole plotlines go nowhere: there is a weird character who dates one of Lisa and Sean’s school friends who gets lots of screen time then is never seen again after episode seven. Their mates Todd and Angela get a soapy storyline about an affair, which never connects back up to any of the main plot. One episode, everyone is convinced someone is evil the next, they’re a trusted ally. All the characters get an unnecessary backstory. The show sags in the middle but then speeds up at the end, with a reveal so over-the-top and extreme, if you don’t scream out loud, you aren’t watching properly.Renée Zellweger, however, is incredible. She shags the handyman in the sex steam room, sobs into her cuddly toy tiger and commits arson, all while her blowdry stays perfect. Is this so bad it’s good? Maybe. Is it so bad it’s actually bad? Also maybe. Like Netflix’s You before it, it’s definitely more “binge-watch-WhatsApp-group-obsession” than Emmy nomination. It doesn’t matter. All that matters is the houses. Also: Renée Zellweger, and the sex steam room. But mainly the houses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58b66e94f20eb215fc3109e257b8e56ff8072717/0_0_7463_4476/master/7463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99dd74d37ff17d61d263cc9bae8ece9a","title":"the us must stand with the people of hong kong","story":"But for policies to be effective we must keep in mind how US actions affect the debate within China, where there is vigorous struggle over the country’s futureAs the United States engages in an increasingly heated debate over policy towards China – the fight against Huawei, the trade war, talk of a new cold war – the protests in Hong Kong serve as a reminder that there are people in China who are concerned about the same things we are – basic rights, jobs, families.In Hong Kong this week hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets to protest a proposed law that would enable the government to extradite Hong Kong citizens to the mainland – legislation perceived as legal cover for the Chinese Communist party (CCP) to jail those in Hong Kong advocating for their democratic rights.But the protests are about much more than this particular law – they are about the dwindling freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, the territory formerly administered by the United Kingdom and handed back to Beijing in 1997. While the Basic Law promises that Hong Kong can maintain its democratic system for at least 50 years, the CCP has increasingly squeezed the rights of the people of Hong Kong. In 2014, another round of massive protests – the “umbrella movement” – erupted to stop an electoral law that placed more power in the hands of the CCP.As calls grow for a tougher US policy towards China, we must remember what we are talking about when we discuss China policy. In a public conversation defined by 240-character statements, we (myself included) too often shorthand the discussion by referring to “China” – but that is misleading. The CCP is the regime that rules China, but as a dictatorship it does not necessarily represent the 1.4 billion Chinese people.The people of Hong Kong still have a certain ability to express their opinions, at least for now. But beyond the baseline repression in a system that does not have simple rights like the freedom of speech and assembly, the CCP in mainland China is becoming even more oppressive: today there are more than a million Uighurs imprisoned in an attempt to extinguish their ethnic identities the CCP is setting up a surveillance state that pulls a page from George Orwell’s 1984 dystopia and daily restrictions on civil society and citizens are becoming harsher and more widespread.We often paint China’s government as a monolith run by the dictator Xi Jinping, but the reality is far more complex. Xi contends with forces inside the government and the sentiments of the people, even if those aren’t expressed through democratic means. The CCP’s top goal is to maintain power, and it lives in a constant state of fear about its legitimacy – and rightly so.The US must deal with the government of China and the challenges it presents, from intellectual property theft to maritime aggression. But for policies to be effective we must keep in mind how US actions affect the debate within China, where there is a vigorous struggle over the future of the country.Take the current US-China trade war, for instance. Depending on who one asks, the US goal is to get China to make specific economic concessions, change China’s entire economic policy, force companies to leave China, or just to “win” – or all of the above. In the process, the trade war is hurting American workers as well as ordinary Chinese citizens, and adding fuel to the CCP’s anti-US propaganda. One recent New York Times report noted that, in China, “Commentators have drawn comparisons between the current trade dispute and China’s humiliation at the hands of foreign powers during the colonial era.”We need specific US policies to deal with specific challenges emanating from China – for instance, a tailored approach to deal with trade and a maritime deterrence strategy in concert with allies. Most importantly we need to be strong at home, growing the US economy and improving our democracy. But the talk of a cold war with China is counterproductive, enabling policies at home that could be racist or impinge on the freedom of Americans.Rhetoric about being “tough” on China doesn’t always seem to equate with actually standing with the people of China. If we want to truly support the people of Hong Kong and those imprisoned in Xinjiang, the United States must speak out, raise the issues at the highest levels, and pursue targeted responses like sanctions on companies and iniduals involved in the repression. And the US must continue to support Hong Kong’s autonomy rather than threaten its special status, as the Trump administration has done.The CCP wants to portray dissent within China as the result of the west fomenting unrest, and today the CCP is selling the lie that foreign actors provoked the Hong Kong protests. Just because Americans may not often see dissent and debate within China does not mean it is not there furthermore, people are scared, and the CCP’s repression gives them good reason to be. The CCP wants to pit its people against the world the United States wants the people of China to have more freedom. But this is not about regime change – it’s a recognition that the more rights the people of China have, the more stable and prosperous China will be.A trade war or a global competition that paints Chinese influence around the world as inherently nefarious will not help them and will not help America. And if we go too far with anti-China hysteria, the people of Hong Kong and mainland China who currently look to the United States as a beacon of freedom may lose faith in us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ced0ff220e26bfc5eff70f9b3100aa9d19b806f2/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db5677c1234c29cb402b47973ea0e3d3","title":"thelma cabrera indigenous woman guatemalas election presidential","story":"The campesino leader is running for president in a country whose indigenous majority is chronically overlooked – and she has a chance of making the runoff﻿An indigenous campesino woman who pledges to root out racism is hoping to cause a historic upset in Guatemala’s elections on Sunday, amid simmering voter anger over political corruption.Thelma Cabrera Pérez, 49, has unexpectedly risen in presidential polls after a frenetic campaign across Guatemala’s rural heartlands where organised crime and agriculture magnates have controlled land and politics since the 36-year civil war ended in 1996.Cabrera, a Maya Mam indigenous rights defender, is currently polling fifth in a crowded field of 20 candidates, but Guatemalan polls are notoriously weighted towards urban areas, and analysts believe she has a serious chance of getting through to a runoff vote in August.Win or lose, her political ascent marks a historic achievement at a time when trust in the country’s status quo is at rock bottom.Indigenous groups suffer the highest rates of malnutrition, illiteracy, landlessness, social exclusion and poverty – all of which have helped drive waves of emigration. In November, Guatemalans overtook Mexicans as the largest group detained at the US border, and the regions where most migrants set out from are overwhelmingly indigenous.Cabrera pledges to tackle the inequalities of Guatemalan society with a sweeping constitutional reform to ensure fair representation for the country’s indigenous, Afro-Guatemalan and mestizo peoples.Other priorities include stopping illegal land-grabs, ending immunity for elected officials, nationalisation of electricity, and legal scrutiny of mining, dam and agricultural licences sanctioned without consultation.“I didn’t ask for this role or buy it – I was elected for this mission by the people, and I’m daring to break the silence as a Mam woman,” Cabrera told the Observer.Cabrera, who speaks Spanish as a second language, grew up in El Asintal, an impoverished community on the west coast, where she worked on coffee fincas with her parents and siblings, and was married at 15.“I came from nothing – from under the rubbish. But for many years I’ve worked with communities suffering lack of opportunities, undignified wages, migration and violence as a result of structural problems and corruption,” she said.She was selected by grassroots members of Codeca, the country’s largest campesino organisation to represent its newly formed political party the Movement for the Liberation of Peoples (MLP).Cabrera’s political hopes were given a major boost by a recent online campaign organised by volunteer communication experts who designed the slogan Yo Elijo Dignidad (I choose dignity).As the buzz around Cabrera got louder, the criticism got uglier. She’s been derided as uneducated and uncouth, and condemned as a radical communist who wants to turn Guatemala into the next Venezuela – an accusation she denies.“She’s given a face and voice to the excluded majority with a radical political project to disrupt and transform the oppressive state. She’s unlike anything we’ve seen since the 1940s,” said Andrea Ixchiu, a member of her communications team. “This candidacy is historic.”The election race has been marred by repeated accusations of corruption as a UN-backed commission against impunity (Cicig) prepares to leave the country after President Jimmy Morales unilaterally declared an end of its mandate.The current frontrunner is Sandra Torres, a former first lady accused of money laundering and illicit campaign financing. In second place is Alejandro Giammattei who was director of prisons while a clandestine death squad carried out extrajudicial killings of detainees.In third place is the businessman Roberto Arzú, who faces sanctions in Miami for failing to comply with a court order to pay off multimillion-dollar debts to his political strategist.The odds are stacked against Cabrera, who closed her campaign last Saturday by thanking in Mam her supporters who had travelled overnight from remote villages with homemade signs.But for many at the event, the hopeful atmosphere was reminiscent of the 2015 anti-corruption protests that eventually led to the resignation, arrest and imprisonment of the then president, Otto Pérez Molina.“It’s time the state stopped being racist – and for that we need structural reforms,” said Linda Rabanales, 24, an anthropology student. “That’s why I’m voting for Thelma.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919980.1560097910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government vows to help teachers abroad return home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen asked if the Government would consider more pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area, the Minister replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions. File photograph: GettyMinister for Education Joe McHugh has pledged to tackle barriers preventing emigrant teachers returning home but has warned he does not have “any quick-fix ideas”.Mr McHugh is due to visit the United Arab Emirates this week to host a series of town hall-style meetings with teachers. The initiative is part of a drive to make it easier for them to return to Ireland.School management bodies say a shortage of teachers is causing a “crisis” due to a lack of substitute cover at primary level and qualified teachers in key subjects at second level.Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr McHugh said he wants to identify practical steps that could make it easier for teachers to return home.A key area he says he will examine is providing a mechanism to recognise teachers’ middle-management experience in schools abroad. Many emigrant teachers express frustration that, despite serving as heads of department, this experience is often not recognised here.“We have to look at the progression of teachers, what new skills, what experience they build up in terms of responsibility,” said Mr McHugh. “We have to open up a wider conversation over the roles of responsibility teachers have abroad and how we incorporate that into the system when they return home. I don’t have any quick-fix ideas around it . . . but those teachers bring experience, talent, insight and new perspectives.”Among the obstacles regularly cited by emigrant teachers include difficulties securing full-time posts at home, red-tape involving the Teaching Council as well as the cost of living.Online portalMr McHugh said a representative from the council will join him for the visit to take on board any ideas for streamlining registration or other issues. He said a new online portal, which opened last week, is an example of the kind of practical steps that would assist emigrant teachers.The portal – which operates under the title turasabhaile or “journey home” – will give teachers the opportunity to register their contact details, CVs, preferred employment location and specialist subjects.Mr McHugh, a former teacher who spent a year teaching in the UAE in the mid-1990s, said the visit also aimed to pay tribute to the contribution of Irish teachers abroad. He said teachers were magnificent ambassadors for the State and were boosting the country’s reputation wherever they go.There are an estimated 2,000 Irish-qualified teachers based in the UAE and hundreds have signed up for three meetings with the Minister in Abu Dhabi, El Ain and Dubai.When asked if the Government would consider additional pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area – which faces some of the most acute shortages – Mr McHugh replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions.He is primarily concerned with looking at the kind of practical steps that can be taken in the short to medium term."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Trump says incident involving two vessels in Gulf of Oman has \u0026lsquoIran written all over it\u0026rsquoIran\u0026rsquos leadership denies involvement in attacks on Norwegian and Japanese tankersMoves follow attack by Israeli aircraft on Hamas military sitesUS releases video purportedly showing Iranian forces taking mine from tanker\u0026rsquos sideBritain backs Washington\u0026rsquos stance as incidents increase tensions in the Middle EastJapan\u0026rsquos prime minister to meet Iranian leaders two weeks after talks with Donald TrumpMurtaja Qureiris, now 18, was arrested aged 13 for role in protests and has been in jail sinceTrump administration seeks to increase economic and military pressure on IranPreliminary investigation into sabotage of tankers finds evidence of \u0026lsquosophisticated\u0026rsquo operationSyrian officials say Israel attacked an airfield east of Homs in the centre of the countryPalestinians and Arab allies cool on proposals, including Gaza expansion into Egypt\u0026rsquos SinaiNetanyahu\u0026rsquos dissolution of parliament causes problems for Trump\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoDeal of the Century\u0026rsquoAnalysis: Pressure grows over failure to form a government and charges of bribery, fraudStatement comes in response to calls from US president for talks on new nuclear dealRiyadh extends invitation to Qatar after two years of tension for talks on oil tanker assaultNetanyahu dissolves parliament to deny opposition chance to form governmentWashington is ratcheting up sanctions in efforts to shut down Iran\u0026rsquos economyTime running out as Binyamin Netanyahu fails to create alliance in wake of April victoryPrime minister has until Wednesday night to put a new administration togetherTrump envoy says Unrwa a \u0026lsquobandaid\u0026rsquo and seeks shift to humanitarian bodies and hosts"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3926042.1560527692!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the outsider candidate with a vital message for democrats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate and former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper speaks during the California Democratic Convention in San Francisco, California on June 1st. Photograph: Stephen LamReutersThe next US presidential election may be 17 months away, but the race to become the Democratic nominee is well under way.In echoes of the Republican campaign for 2016, which saw dozens compete to become the party’s nominee, this time it’s Democrats who are jostling in a crowded field. Twenty-four candidates have thrown their hat in the ring, arguing that they are the right person to take on Donald Trump in 2020.Although the entry of Joe Biden into the race in April changed the dynamic of the contest as he rapidly became the frontrunner, it’s early days.One of the presidential hopefuls is John Hickenlooper. This week the former Colorado governor brought his wares to Washington, where he addressed the National Press Club.In such a crowded field it’s tricky to stand out from the crowd. Hickenlooper can’t even depend on being the candidate with the unusual name – he has tough competition in this regard from Pete Buttigieg, the youthful mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is now widely known as “Mayor Pete” such is the confusion about the pronunciation of his Maltese surname.But while Hickenlooper may not be a household name, he comes to the table with a respectable political record.Walked the walkA former two-term mayor of Denver who was governor of Colorado between 2011 and 2018, Hickenlooper is popular in his home state. He presided over a strong economy and left office having implemented a range of progressive social measures such as the legalisation of marijuana and the expansion of pre-kindergarten education.He has an interesting personal story to boot – having been made redundant as a geologist in the 1980s, he started a brewery business in a neglected area of downtown Denver, before running for mayor.Though the genial 67-year-old is trailing at about 1 per cent in the polls, he made no apologies about his decision at his event in Washington. “I am the only person running who has actually done what everyone else is talking about.”He promptly turned his attention to Bernie Sanders, lambasting the vision of “democratic socialism” outlined by the Vermont senator earlier in the week.“I fundamentally disagree that we should do away with the Democratic regulated capitalism that has guided this country for over 200 years,” he said, criticising his colleagues for not calling Sanders out.“Democrats must say loudly and clearly that we are not socialists. If we do not we will end up helping to re-elect the worst president in American history,” he said, correctly pointing out that Republicans are effectively using the socialist label to attack Democrats in the run-up to the election.Refreshing optimismInstead, Hickenlooper, a self-made millionaire, is firmly positioning himself as a centrist. Pointing to his experience in governing Colorado, he said that “sometimes you have to talk to Republicans”. American capitalism has to be reformed, he said, but this can’t be done by “endlessly expanding government or by demonising the private sector”.His message is that Medicare for all – the idea of a universal, government-paid healthcare programme – and the Green New Deal – a climate-conscious government investment programme – are pie-in-the-sky policies which won’t wash with most Americans.Nonetheless, for all his big ideas, Hickenlooper is unlikely to make the cut when the Democratic field whittles down. Though he just reached the threshold to qualify as one of the 20 Democratic candidates taking part in the first debate later this month in Miami, he faces formidable competition from better-known candidates such as Biden, senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke.This is not stopping him from trying, however. He has made several trips to early-voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina since announcing his candidacy in March.His sunny brand of optimism is refreshing. It also offers some lessons for those who are more likely to be in the race for the long haul.Over the past few months, he said, he has been struck by how consistent voters’ concerns are in each state – healthcare is the top-ranking issue, he says, followed by climate change and economic stability. “We’ve gotten to a place in this country that a majority of Americans don’t think they’re going to be better off than they are in 10 years than they are today,” he says.As Democrats begin the process of deciding who is best-positioned to win back the White House in 2020, taking those concerns on board is vital if the party wants to connect with voters."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeTwo teenagers killed within minutes of each other in London stabbing and shooting Sudan crisis: What is happening, and where does it go from here?Duke of Kent, 83, involved in car crash with student in BrightonTributes paid two years on from the Grenfell disasterRAF helicopters scramble to Lincolnshire town amid devastating floods Activist arrested in Russia for marijuana days after journalist released in groundless drugs caseJeremy Corbyn says he has seen \u0026#39no credible evidence\u0026#39 Iran is to blame for oil tanker attackComment: Only a new brand of BoJoism can make \u0026#39Boris the buffoon\u0026#39 a truly great PMNotre-Dame to host first mass since devastating fireRAF sergeant jailed for role in £1 million drug smuggling ringRussian bots tried to influence EU elections, says BrusselsRoyals give seed fund to wounded warriors helping medical scienceOne in six baby boomers has second home, Resolution Foundation report findsBlue badges for anxiety to be given go ahead as \u0026#39hidden disabilities\u0026#39 to be counted for first time Cricket chiefs plan alcohol free stadia for new event in bid to lure younger fans from migrant communitiesDavid Bowie thanked me for punching him in the face, says childhood friend whose blow gave star his different coloured eyesChuka Umunna is expected to want to run to be LibDem leader within 12 months, LibDem MPs sayCyclist who left pensioner with life-threatening injuries after crash convicted under Victorian lawPensioners to march on BBC offices across Britain in protest against plan to axe licences for over-75sWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

More than 1.2 million people born in the 1950s reported owning an additional property - including buy-to-let and overseas - between 2014 and 2016.The number of British adults who own a second property has grown by 53 per cent since 2001, sitting at 5.5 million people and a total value of £941 billion.The figures come despite the overall decline of home ownership across the UK, which peaked in 2003 at 58 per cent of families but then continued falling until 2016.The rise in multiple property ownership is down to a “rapid growth” in the number of people buying houses in Britain to rent out, the report said, with almost two million people - the majority being older, higher income and southern - owning buy-to-lets.The second home boom has also benefited millennials, with seven per cent of those born in the 1960s and 1980s having additional property wealth by the age of 29,  the Foundation’s Game of Homes report found.The “surprisingly rapid rise” of multiple property ownership among the young generation could mean that those currently in their 30s may be on the way to similar rates of additional property ownership as today’s middle-aged cohorts.“If we were to redraw the chart of additional property ownership by age in thirty years’ time, there is a chance it might not look particularly different from today,” the report said.Buy to letThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Yutaka Katada, the company president, said reports of a mine attack were false.Both vessels suffered explosions, forcing crews to abandon ship and leave them adrift in waters between Gulf Arab states and Iran. All crew members were safely evacuated.Navy Captain Bill Urban, a Central Command spokesman, said the Revolutionary Guard vessel was observed at 4.10pm local time approaching the Kokuka Courageous.He said: It was observed and recorded removing the unexploded limpet mine from the Kokuka Courageous.He added: The United States has no interest in engaging in a new conflict in the Middle East. However, we will defend our interests. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said: Taken as a whole these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the freedom of navigation and an unacceptable campaign of escalating tension by Iran.Mr Pompeo said American assessment of Iran\u0027s responsibility was based on intelligence sources, the weapons used and the level of expertise, saying no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.In a statement the Iranian mission to the United Nations said Tehran categorically rejects the US unfounded claim with regard to 13 June oil tanker incidents and condemns it in the strongest possible terms.It accused the United States and its allies, including Saudi Arabia, of warmongering.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said the UK believed the US assessment that Iran was responsible but repeated his warning there was a serious danger of the US and Iran stumbling into an unwanted war. “We have no reason not to believe the American assessment and our instinct is to believe it because they are our closest ally, Mr Hunt told the Today programme. “We are very worried about the situation in Iran because at the moment both sides in this dispute think the other side doesn’t want war and the risk you have is that then they doing something provocative that leads to catastrophic consequences that weren’t intended.” The explosions, which left one of the oil tankers burning outside the strategic Strait of Hormuz waterway, marked the most serious incident since the White House warned in early May that Iran was plotting attacks in the region.    The incident came one month after Iranian forces allegedly used naval mines to blow holes in two oil tankers and two smaller ships off the Emirati port of Fujairah. The US publicly said Iran was behind that attack, while Tehran denied responsibility. Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said “suspicious doesn’t begin to describe” the incident in Gulf of Oman. He previously suggested without evidence that Israel was staging the attacks to undermine Iran.   Responding to Mr Zarif\u0027s comments, Mr Pompeo said:  Foreign Minister Zarif may think this is funny but no one else in the world does.The explosions at sea came hours before Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, met with Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, on a diplomatic mission intended to try to ease tensions between Iran and the US.But the Japanese leader’s efforts appeared to bear little fruit. Ayatollah Khamenei refused to hear any messages from Donald Trump delivered by Mr Abe, the Iranian government said. The ayatollah also said Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons but “America could not do anything” to stop Tehran if it did decide to pursue a nuclear course. Mr Trump on Thursday ruled out the possibility of making a deal with Iran, saying: While I very much appreciate PM Abe going to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready, and neither are we!Both tankers were carrying “Japanese-related” cargo, according to Japan’s government. It was not clear if that was a coincidence or if the targeting of the ships was done deliberately to coincide with Mr Abe’s visit to Tehran.   While Iran’s civilian government denies responsibility for any of the attacks, it is possible that the Revolutionary Guard, who answer directly to the supreme leader, are carrying out operations without the government’s knowledge or consent. Iran tries to keep tensions between the two sides concealed but they spilled into the open early this year when Mr Zarif threatened to resign after he was left out of a key meeting while a senior Revolutionary Guard commander was invited.Markets Hub I Brent SpotThe attacks capped six weeks of building tensions between Iran and the US during which time Mr Trump has ordered an aircraft carrier, a bomber taskforce and 1,500 additional troops to the Middle East.  Both the US and Iran say they are not looking for war but Britain and other countries have warned of the danger that the two sides could stumble into an unintended conflict. Antonio Gutteres, the UN secretary general, condemned the attack and warned that the world cannot afford “a major confrontation in the Gulf region”. Any fighting near the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway which transports 20 per cent of the world’s oil, would likely cause serious damage to global energy supplies.Analysts said that Iran appeared to be lashing out in order to send a message in response to crippling US sanctions imposed by Mr Trump after he withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal.“I think Iran is showing that it has teeth,” said Charles Hollis, a former British diplomat in Tehran who is now managing director of the Falanx Assynt consultancy. “It’s a way of showing that if they are backed into a corner they are not without means of causing grief.” Iran has warned that it will begin enriching high-grade uranium, the kind that could be used for a nuclear weapon, in July unless Europe finds a way to get around US sanctions and prop up the Iranian oil and banking sectors.  The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The Mayor should scrap this £K event and use the money instead to keep Newham residents safe.This absurd situation would be funnyit wasn’t such a shocking indictment of this Mayor’s skewed priorities. People will rightly question why Khan is prioritising paddling pools over the safety of vulnerable Londoners.The Mayor has repeatedly said he cant spent more cash on police and fighting crime as his central budgets have been cut too much.Last years pop-up party featured street food stalls and classic film screenings too.The final bill came to an eye-watering £,, we revealed last year.The money for the beach project came from the London Economic Action Partnership - which works under the Mayors office.The cash for the project was from business rates generated in the local area. , Londoners flocked to the beach to enjoy a -metre swimming lido, a sun deck, street food stalls and musical entertainment - all for free.A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: The Royal Docks is set to become a major new district for London with up to , jobs and , new affordable homes.

dioptres – a measurement of the focusing power of the lenses needed to correct her eyesight.A person with mild myopia registers somewhere between -. and -D.He told Wired this was due to the eyeball growing, especially in populations of Asian descent, and causing severe visual impairment, through glaucoma retinal detachment and other retinal problems.He said: The initial theory for this is that people are doing more near-plane reading activity with smartphones which is encouraging the eye to become myopic to meet that environmental need.Mr Bastawrous added that another factor was that people are now spending less time outdoors than we did previously.He suggested that people were not getting enough UV light exposure, which was a likely predictive factor for becoming very shortsighted.The eye specialist added: So spending time looking at near targets like smartphones may be contributing but that also means that children are not spending time outside, playing outdoors and kicking a football around, which is having a knock-on effect of not looking out into infinity very often.Many people no longer spend time looking at the stars and the mountains, theyre looking at screens more often instead.Dr Liu Wei, at the Yangzhou Maternal and Child Care Service Centre, said the girl’s case was down to prolonged and premature usage of electronic devices.A report from the World Health Organisation in April recommended toddlers under the age of one should not be exposed to electronic screens and that kids between the age of two and four should be limited to no more than one hour of “sedentary screen time” a day.According to figures released by China’s National Health Commission, the overall myopia rate in kids and adolescents was . per cent in  and in high school students it was  per cent."},{"url":null,"title":"hunters mountain lion wyoming yellowstone","story":"Austin Peterson, , Trey Juhnke, , and Corbin Simmons, , were sentenced last month to a three-year worldwide hunting ban after authorities tracked them down via social media.According to investigation documents, other hunters alerted game wardens to photos of the three men from Montana posing with their illegal mountain lion kill, which had been shared to Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook.In one of the photos posted to social media, two of the men are standing behind a horizontal tree branch that the dead animal is draped over.In another, one of the young men is holding up the leless dead animal with a smile on his face.After the arrest, Yellowstone special agent Jake Olson told reporters: “We ended up getting a lot of this information from a guy in Bozeman off of Facebook because of a bunch of stuff on social media.Fox reports that each of the men admitted to shooting the mountain lion in the park on December  of last year, before taking it back to their vehicle across the border.But they later changed their story when authorities interviewed them separately.The three men contradicted details in each other’s accounts, including details of the location of the boundary posts, the colour of Peterson’s GPS screen when it supposedly maled and who shot at the lion.Authorities learned that all three men had fired at the mature male lion, which was shot eight times and killed it after it crossed the border into Yellowstone.The men’s actions were found to be in violation of the Lacey Act of , per the National Park Service, which prohibits the taking, selling or purchasing of wildle from protected areas.Hunting mountain lions is legal in the state of Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park, but the trio had deliberately crossed the parks borders and killed the animal in a protected area.They also tried to sneak the animal back to their car without telling authorities -

That was amazing,” said Mr Ananenko.The disaster killed  people died - including two at the scene and  firefighters.But the three men’s bravery prevented further catastrophic explosions and many more deaths occurring.Andrew Leatherbarrow, author of  book Chernobyl ::, explains: This would have done unimaginable damage and destroyed the entire power station, including the three other reactors.Describing their heroic efforts, Leatherbarrow says: The men entered the basement in wetsuits, radioactive water up to their knees, in a corridor stuffed with a myriad of pipes and valves…It was like finding a needle in a haystack.Initial reports were that the three men died of radiation poisoning but they all survived.Baranov died in  but Mr Bespalov is still alive and lives in the same district of the Ukrainian capital Kiev as Mr Ananenko."},{"url":null,"title":"sir philip green lonely on 100m yacht friends abandon","story":"With his retail empire teetering on the brink of collapse, the disgraced businessman was holed up in a beachfront cafe, a phone glued to his ear.On Wednesday,  miles away in rain-lashed Britain his landlords and creditors were voting on an th-hour rescue package for his beleaguered Arcadia Group, which owns High Street stores including Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins.When I approached Green in the tax-haven millionaires’ playground on the French Riviera before the vote, he sneered: “You’re wasting your time.”But gone was the mischievous grin of the self-made mogul who, at the peak of his powers, christened himself “the emperor of retail”.A fellow diner in the modest Da Caterina snack bar said: “He seemed to be on the phone most of the time as he sipped an espresso.“Then he left the cafe and sat in the sunshine on the seafront. He looked like he had the worries of the world on his shoulders.”But after news came through that a deal — which will still see around  of his UK stores close and around , jobs at risk — had been agreed, Green could at least unwind on his £million superyacht moored nearby.It has been a tumultuous week in a scandal-hit few years for the retail magnate. On Tuesday another woman broke cover in the US to accuse him of sexual harassment.Fitness instructor Jenner McAmis claimed she had to wear several jackets to deter the “grabby” businessman from trying to grope her.Jenner, , told The Sun she was speaking out for the women in the UK who were muzzled by a court order brought by the tycoon last year.Croydon-born Green, , has separately been charged with four counts of assault for allegedly groping Pilates instructor Katie Surridge.The case is due to be heard on Wednesday but Green, who denies the claims, is not expected to attend.The business boss has also been engulfed by accusations of sexist, racist and bullying behaviour towards staff.Some alleged victims have been prevented from speaking out due to controversial non-disclosure agreements.In May the man once celebrated for his Midas touch was again accused of groping his female staff.Under protection of Parliamentary privilege, Lord Hain revealed that an alleged whistleblower had told him Green was “touching and repeatedly slapping women staff’s bottoms, grabbing thighs and touching legs”.The series of scandals has led to growing demands that he be stripped of his knighthood from, among others, Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and MPs Frank Field and Jess Phillips.Downing Street insists it is a matter for independent review.Green’s fall from grace began after BHS, the retail chain he sold in March  for £, went into administration leaving a £million hole in its pension fund.He later agreed a £million cash settlement to plug the gap.The businessman has spent years commuting to work in Britain, flying in on a £million Gulfstream private jet and staying at Mayfair’s luxury Dorchester Hotel before ing to Monaco for the weekend.But now it seems he wants to move to the French principality for good.A friend said recently: “He doesn’t want to be in Britainhe’s not wanted here. He feels he’s been treated appallingly and has no desire to come back.”The Met police has been under pressure to launch an investigation into Green’s alleged sexual harassment, and friends believe he could be targeted more easilyhe s.In Monaco, Green lives in a -storey tower where Beatle Ringo Starr once owned an apartment and where the cheapest flats sell for £million.According to locals, Green is often seen strolling down Avenue Princesse Grace on the seafront, one of the most expensive streets in the world.After the BHS scandal broke, there were reports that some of his Monaco friends had cooled on him.One prominent resident was “thoroughly p***ed off” with him, saying that he had dragged “the whole principality into the dirt”.Another neighbour claimed “people don’t want to be associated with him in the way they used to be”.Few of those names would want to be pictured with him now, and it is doubtful we will again witness scenes as extravagant as his £million th birthday party back in .For that celebration he was joined in Mexico by guests including Kate Hudson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Simon Cowell and Naomi Campbell.Music came from Robbie Williams and The Beach Boys, while Michael Buble duetted with his daughter Chloe.Since then Simon Cowell has made his change of feelings perfectly clear — in November last year he paid around £million to buy back Green’s five per cent stake in his company Syco.The tycoon has also lost several female aides in the wake of the #MeToo scandal.In February Baroness Karren Brady, a columnist on The Sun On Sunday, quit as chairman of Taveta Investments, the holding company which owns Arcadia.Non-executive director Sharon Brown and in-house solicitor Deborah Cooper also left the company.In March Green was dumped by PR firm Maitland AMO after they decided his reputation was “too toxic”.And according to The Sunday Times Rich List, he has lost his coveted billionaire status, with his fortune dropping from £.billion to £million over the past  months.Green, who is married to Tina and has children Chloe and Brandon, is now th on the list.Daughter Chloe has also been making headlines lately.Her relationship with “Hot Felon” Jeremy Meeks is reportedly on the rocks after she posed without her engagement ring at a charity gala this month.The -year-old heiress was said to be upset that Meeks did not attend their son Jayden’s first birthday party, and was instead pictured in Calornia a few days previously.Meeks, who has been snapped cosying up to other women in the past few weeks, is also refusing to sign a pre-nup agreement that the Greens requested.It seems Green has plenty to think about as he strolls in the Monaco sunshine.The rump of his retail empire, which also includes Burton, Wallis and Evans, may have been saved for now, but it is under pressure from online competition, hefty business rates and changing fashion tastes.At one of his doomed UK stores, Topshop in Ashton-under-Lyne, Gtr Manchester, signs were advertising reductions of up to  per cent.Asked about the reported store closure, one young employee said: “We’ve been told not to say anything.”Passing shoppers said they had been put off buying from Topshop by Green’s alleged behaviour.Jessica Gregson, a -year-old carer, said: “I wouldn’t shop there as it’s expensive and I’m really put off by Sir Philip Green and how he’s accused of acting towards women. It’s all horribly sleazy.” Her mum Jo, , said: “It’s not what it used to be. It’s a shame as people are losing jobs.”Simone Clutton, , who works in a cosmetics shop, was coming out of the store having not bought anything.The mum of two said: “I think it is a bit old fashioned now and they haven’t really kept up with the age of internet shopping.“Less and less people go to his shops but I think Sir Philip’s reputation has something to do with that. He’s seen as sleazy and a bully and that does put women off especially.”The day after the vote to save his empire, Green’s ft superyacht Lionheart steamed into Monaco after coming down the coast from Italy.Its arrival will make a welcome distraction for a man whose world is in turmoil.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Run water first. If its a first degree burn, can apply aloe vera. If its second or third degree, see a doctor first before applying anything.One person noted: So suggesting toothpaste for everything might not be the best idea after all. FIRST AID FOR BURNSThis may mean removing the person from the area, dousing flames with water, or smothering flames with a blanket.Do not put yourself at risk of getting burnt as well.But do not try to remove anything thats stuck to the burnt skin, as this could cause more damage.Never use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances like butter.Use a blanket or layers of clothing, but avoid putting them on the injured area.Keeping warm will prevent hypothermia, where a persons body temperature drops below C .This is a riskyoure cooling a large burnt area, particularly in young children and elderly people.Put the cling film in a layer over the burn, rather than wrapping it around a limb.A clean clear plastic bag can be used for burns on your hand.Always check the manufacturers instructions when using over-the-counter medication.Children under  years of age should not be given aspirin.Avoid lying down for as long as possible, as this will help reduce swelling.Source: NHS"},{"url":null,"title":"brian reade tory leadership chancers","story":"NewsopinionBrian Reade: Tory leadership chancers are like a tragic Britains Got Talent freak-festThe big dference being everyone with a phone can eventually vote on the BGT freak-fest, whereas only .% of the electorate, a section comprising like-minded, wild-eyed aliens, gets the final say on the country’s next leaderShareCommentsByBrian Reade:,  JUN NewsopinionThe original  Tory leadership candidates \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere have been many painful national humiliations in recent British history.

The astonishing strike features in a fantastic new video celebrating the £m raised by The National Lottery for grassroots football. It sees a mystery youngster unleash a rocket from just inside her own half, which wrong-foots the boy in the opposition net and flies in. But what caught our eye was the looks of utter shock on the faces of the boys who canapost quite believe what has happened. Football has the power to change lives - but moments like this prove it’s not just the players at the top of the game who are making a dference.  It’s on the local parks and playing fields where le-changing moments are happening everyday, right across the UK.  Since , players of The National Lottery have raised £billion for good causes, with over £ million being used to support grassroots football initiatives. That’s money that has been raised by you. For every ticket sold, a slice of the money received goes to a huge iety of projects, big and small.  From building new football venues, to inspiring future generations to participate, projects like these have helped thousands of people improve their lives, and made Britain’s communities a better place to live and work.  It’s thanks to National Lottery funding that young players like -year-old Charlie Fryhas found a route into football - despite his disability. Charlie was devastated when he was told he was unable to play mainstream football after being diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome seven years ago.  Then his mother Rachel and father Lee discovered Team United, a Scottish-based charity which has received National Lottery funding and offers young players with disabilities a route back into the game. As mum Rachel explains, the results have been le-changing. “Charlie was seven when he was diagnosed. “We were told that because of his sensory issues, he’ll wouldn’t be able to play football which was devastating for him.  “But Team United came at just the right time. The coaches there can read his body language, and understand it. They know how to coach children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. “He’s now back playing mainstream football with Bathgate Thistle Whites  and they won West Lothian County Cup final last year, with Charlie being voted the team’s player of the year.” Another youngster to benefit is Sophie Brett , who has been able to turn her le around thanks to National Lottery funding.  The -year-old battled PTSD and turned to self-harming after a dficult childhood saw her taken into foster care. But thanks to Swansea-based charity Street Football Wales, which received £k of National Lottery funding in March, Sophie has started to turn her le around. “I’d always had a passion for football and in  my support worker put me in touch with Street Football Wales, who brought me along to a match day once a month, she explained.  “The staff there have all the time in the world to help anyone and everyone – it’s a safe environment to be in. I’m a much better person and my le is much brighter. “There’s light at the end of the tunnel now.” - An average of  National Lottery grants in every UK postcode district - £bn raised for good causes since - Around £m a week to good causes- Over  local football projects supported across the UK   Former army medic and computer engineer Bahman Jamalaldini is another deserving benefactor of lottery funding. His le was turned upside-down when he contracted meningococcal meningitis in  and had to undergo a series of amputations – but National Lottery-funded charity LimbPower soon helped him back on to his new prosthetic feet. “I’ve always loved playing football but I thought my playing days were over,” says Bahman, , from Milton Keynes.  “After weeks in hospital I thought what sort of le is a quadruple amputee like me going to lead  Then I heard about LimbPower which helps amputees and those with physical impairments take part in sports and other activities. “We all bonded with each other playing football, which amazingly I discovered I was still able to do with prosthetic legs. “I’ve discovered, thanks in large part to LimbPower, that I can pretty much do all the sports I did before and live le again to the full.” Hayley Stringfellow, Head of Brand Marketing at Camelot, commented: “Players of National Lottery games raise around £m for good causes every week. We have thousands of stories to tell about the amazing things that are happening thanks to National Lottery funding.  “It’s great to shine a spotlight on the funding of local football projects and the positive impact it has on iniduals and communities.” Over the past  years more than , projects have been funded across the UK - the equivalent of around  National Lottery grants in every UK postcode district.

Geoff Smith, , had his demonstration livestreamed on Facebook in a bid to fight for Bobbiemayaposs legal right to an education. The -year-old was allegedly sent home from Cockburn John Charles Academy in Belle Isle, Leeds for wearing the discreet, clear earring, which her family says helps ease her migraines.So Geoff, a self-employed roofer, covered his hands with glue and a type of plaster called Polyfilla and stuck them to two metal bars outside the school. His protest lasted around one hour but he eventually pulled his hands free when ordered to do so by police. A layer of skin remained attached to the bars.    During the standoff, the father said: I have superglued myself to the gate. My daughter has got a legal right to an education. The superglue is burning my hands at the minute... but I would put myself through any pain so my daughter can live le without pain. After less than a minute a worker from the school comes over and asks: What are you doing . Geoff, who works as a roofer, instructs the man to call the fire brigade.   West Yorkshire Police and the fire service attended the scene during lunchtime. When Geoff yanked himself free, he entered the school to talk to senior staff.Bobbiemay got the piercing in her tragus - the middle part of the outer ear - five weeks ago. Alternative medicine proponents argue some ear piercings stimulate nerves under the skin and muscle tissues, thereby producing pain-relieving substances, such as endorphins. Geoff says the piece of jewellery is not a fashion statement and that he bought the smallest, most inconspicuous stud he could to avoid it being an issue at school.  Speaking yesterday, he said: Itaposs awful for a school to deprive a child of their education for something so minor. We tried everything to stop Bobbiemayaposs migraines - she can be in agonising pain for a week at a time with them. But she hasnapost had one since getting the piercing five weeks ago. The piercing is working, itaposs not coming out. He added: Bobbiemay was doing really well at that school so thataposs where I want her go go back to. Sheaposs missed a lot of school now and itaposs not fair. Sheaposs an intelligent child and they have had no other issues with her until now.  Cockburn John Charles Academy, which serves more than , children, opened in April last year. It is yet to have an OFSTED inspection as a result. In a statement this week, it said: We would like to make it clear Bobbiemay Smith has not been excluded from the academy. She is welcome back at any time, as long as the earring is removed. Students and parents are aware of our clear unorm policy which is applied consistently. In this particular case, medical evidence or a doctoraposs note has not been provided to suggest exceptional circumstances. At all times, our focus is on Bobbiemayaposs welfare and best interests and we hope to see herto the academy as soon as possible.

The -year-old dad-of-two spoke about his horric experience at the hands of sepsis to an audience of nurses and medics from the Royal College of Nursingat its annual congress.Tom explained the role Leicester Cityaposs miracle Premier League victory in   played in his personal journey to recovery.    He said: “Football is another thing. As soon as I was able I learnt to drive again and that meant that I could take the kids to school. “It also meant that I could secretly, as this was my main aim, take my son Freddie to watch Leicester City. “The club has this wonderful thing with the disabled supporters group where they give you a season ticket on a discount. I paid £. Then they give you a season ticket for free to go with it, which is your carer’s ticket.    “And Freddie, who was six years old, was my carer. “They actually gave him a card with his photo on it that said he was my carer – and it was like his best thing. “He used to take me to the football and, whenever I stood up and started giving it some he’d say ‘Dad, sit down... sit downapos. “Then at half-time, he used to go off and get me a cup of tea. “He took that role really seriously and we’ve been going ever since to every home game.”  The first match Freddie and Tom went to see Leicester play they were at the bottom of League One.

Paris Glover, , has also never been late to Archbishop Sentamu Academy and Stockwell Primary School in Hull. Even when she has been ill, Paris has never felt like she needed to take a day off. My parents are my motivation. If it was not for them I would have given up straight away but there is no point in just giving up, she told Hull Daily Mail . In primary I used to really like school and I did it one year not having a day off and it is just something I have kept up with. I liked primary school more than I liked secondary. I think it is less important and less stressful and you can just chillax in primary, but secondary is more uptight.    If I feel ill I go to school and I feel better. I don’t feel bad when I’m at school. The dedicated teenager, of Greatfield, Hull, is expected to achieve mostly  to  grades in her GCSE’s, with  to ’s in photography and drama. She intends to go to college and possibly join the armed forces as a combat medic. The pupil continued: Geography is one of my favourite subjects because my teacher Mr Greenhough is really good. I also enjoy photography, Mr Capper used to be my form teacher and he is head of photographer and also a good teacher. I also like English and I do cadets and drama after-school.    I want to go into public services. I really want to go in the army one day as a combat medic and then become a paramedic when I come out. I want to do stuff like forensic science and work in a psychiatric hospital trying to people through their struggles. But I want to go into the army first to get my confidence up and work from there.  Parisapos father, John Manolasses, said: It is a great achievement. I said to heryou can do it one year you can do it another and keep going. The more you go to school the more you learn. I don’t think they will see kids like her again and I don’t just mean with her going to school I mean with her commitment with going to school. There was one day where her mum said she had to get up for school and Paris thought it was time to go. As she was heading to school there was no children and she thought she was late and started running.  By the time she got through the school gates the caretaker said to her ‘you do know it is only seven o’clock’. She arrived one hour and  minutes before she was meant to be there. She never realised. Archbishop Sentamu Academy Principal Chay Bell described Paris’ % attendance record as a fantastic achievement. He said: To achieve  per cent attendance throughout your time in school is a fantastic achievement. It shows your commitment and fortitude. Studies show that good attendance, more often than not, lead to excellent outcomes.   We are all incredibly proud of Paris at the Academy and look forward to having many more students with  per cent in the coming years. Her family are rightly sharing her story with the city of Hull.  Christy Coulter has been the headteacher at Stockwell Primary School for nine years and has fond memories of Paris’ ‘unique’ attendance record in primary school and was not surprised she managed to keep it going. He said: “I remember the occasion well, we marked it by buying Paris a bike. It is not something we have done before or since. “It is one of those unique achievements and I am not surprised she has carried it on.  “She was a lovely child, always happy. A very determined inidual and this is part of her character. She was strongly supported by her family who were always proud of her achievements. “It is quite dficult to not be off because children get ill and it is part of growing up.

Rock Hugo Basil Feilding-Mellen’s th birthday bash saw a who’s who of socialites and stars descend on Stanway House in Gloucestershire, including actress Rosamund Pike and John Lennon’s musician son Sean. Photos on social media showed millionaires rubbing shoulders at his mum’s ,-acre Jacobean manor as families prepared themselves to commemorate the tragedy that killed . Grenfell United, the survivors and bereaved families group, said: “Seeing these pictures is like a gut punch. “We are no closer to justice, yet people that should be answering questions for the deaths of  people and the devastation of our community are living without consequence. It’s disgraceful. “Because of what was done to us there are  birthdays we didn’t celebrate this year and two children who never made it to their first.”    Edward Daffarn lived in Grenfell Tower and almost lost his le in the fire. He said: “It makes me feel like I did when reading the following quote from the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald: ‘they were careless people...they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clear up the mess that they made’.” A source who revealed the party had taken place said: “I’m just appalled at the arrogance of these people revelling in the run-up to the Grenfell anniversary. “There are seventy-two people who’ll never have another birthday.” Moyra Samuels, of the Justice  Grenfell campaign, said Rock Feilding-Mellen’s decision to hold a party with his rich and famous pals just three weeks before the two year anniversary of the fire showed he was “morally bankrupt”. She said “He’s quite indferent to the impact that such a thing might have on a grieving and quite sensitive community. He’s oblivious.  “He lives in an elite and removed world, and always has, even though he was he was based not far from the tower. “He’s been raised, nurtured and brought up with this entitled attitude. “It comes as no surprise, but it is indicative of the fact that actually people like him who were involved in the council at the time of the fire and made some serious decisions that influenced what happened are still continuing to act asit is of no consequence that  people died. “They think this should not change their lives, and they will continue to indulge.” She added: “You would have thought this would be a time to show some sensitivity and some subtlety.” Moyra, a teacher, said as the inquiry into the fire dragged on slowly the community felt justice was being denied as key decision makers like Mr Feilding-Mellen moved on with their lives and escaped sanction. She said: “Every aspect of the procedure of justice and truth has been thwarted, in all sorts of ways, by a ruling, privileged elite who indicate to this community and, quite frankly, the rest of the country, that they don’t have any shame in them.”  She added: “He’s completely morally bankrupt. But people like him have the audacity to lecture younger generations.” Fielding-Mellen did not comment when approached by the Mirror. Mr Feilding-Mellen was deputy mayor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Cha during the refurbishment of the tower, and was the chairman of the housing committee. He reportedly urged refurbishment consultants in  to reduce costs on cladding. At that point £, was cut from a £ million budget and now-banned flammable aluminium  were to be installed, rather than the zinc cladding which was originally planned. After being elected to Kensington in  Mr Feilding-Mellen became deputy leader in  and took a seat on the powerful major planning development committee. In  he warned that the council’s housing redevelopment programme would need to be completed “with no recurrent cost to the general council taxpayer”.  After news of his involvement in the Grenfell refit emerged he was forced to flee his family’s £.million Kensington home in the wake of the fire, fearing for his family’s safety. He stood down as deputy mayor of the borough after the fire, and left the council at last year’s local elections. Days after Grenfell, in , he told friends he was cancelling plans to visit Stanway House for the th birthday of his step-sister Mary Charteris, who is a model and member of the band The Big Pink. Those who did go to Mary’s party included Cara Delevingne, actor Jaime Winstone and aristocrats including Scarlett Spencer-Churchill.

The Duchess of Sussex is much readier for her role than Diana ever was, particularly when it comes to her maturity and drive, according to journalist Jennie Bond. Meghanaposs commitment to charitable causes, along with her fashion style, has created an acknowledged resemblance between the two. And when the Duke and Duchess announced their engagement, Prince Harry said his fiancee and late mother would have been as thick as thieves. But Bond, who spoke to Yahooaposs The Royal Box, said their is a distinguishing dference between the two women.  She said: She is being compared to Diana and Iaposm sorry thataposs not the case. She is a very dferent woman. Much more mature, much more knowing for her own role, and wishes and causes she wishes to espouse. She is much readier for her role than Diana ever was. Ms Bond also warned the Duchess to avoid aposplaying any games with the pressapos and to steer clear of courting a celebrity status. She said: That doesnapost go down well with the public. And try to ignore she is getting quite a lot of flack from a lot of directions.  Royal expert Victoria Murphy told ITV that she believed Meghan and Harry are very clear about doing things their own way while respecting tradition. She explained: I think that we are going to see them in the future make decisions that they feel are right for them that maybe have been dferent from decisions that have gone before. I think it will definitely be important to Meghan that her influences remain strong for this baby.

Danielle Bartley-Mould, , needed her right arm amputated in a bid to save her le after contracting septicaemia following the car accident in . The foster carer also suffered a broken neck and spine, but it wasnapost until she went through  months of not having a period that she was told she could no longer have babies due to damage done to her fallopian tubes. Danielle, and her husband, Tony, , from Market Weighton, York, spent their savings on two rounds of IVF and they are now over the moon to be expecting twins. She said: I woke up after  days in a coma to find my left arm had been amputated, my parents had to make the decision for me.  My arm had been pushed out of the car window and the car rolled on it. I was in hospital for six weeks before I was allowed home, it was a huge shock to lose my arm but I did my best to stay positive for my son Ethan, now . She explained how she and Tony began trying to have a baby at the start of  but it wasnapost happening naturally so she went to the doctor to seeher irregular periods were the reason. The carer said the doctors told her it was normal sheaposd had some irregularity given it can take up to seven years for a body to recover from such trauma.  Danielle said she tried all sorts of tests and underwent keyhole surgery to try and find the cause for her infertility. She was told her tubes were damaged beyond repair. That was when it became like a race against time, as the couple didnapost want to wait anymore. They gathered £, and went to Cyprus in December for IVF which failed. When someone tells you that you canapost have children, it is heart-breaking, Danielle said. We decided to give IVF one more try in the UK, and we couldnapost believe it when our first two week pregnancy test told us that we were having two babies, weaposre so happy. Danielle contracted septicaemia when her arm hit the road of the crash but it spread while surgeons tried to rebuild her arm after her accident which she says is the reason the entire limb was later removed.  She said the septicaemia  was spreading so rapidly that my parents were told I had  hours to live unless they amputated my arm. Danielle, Tony and Ethan are now excited for the future and to become a family of five. She added: We were absolutely ecstatic when we found out we are having twins, and are ridiculously excited to meet them. People wonder will I manage with just one arm, but I am very capable and I am always finding new ways to do things. It may take me a little longer to do things like tie my hair but I can still drive and look after myself and family. It has all happened so fast, last year I was told I was unable to have more and now I have two on the way, we couldnapost be happier.

Passengers on the plane said one man who was taken off onto the Ibiza Airport runway having yelled ‘p***y’ at a woman who was complaining about him. Earlier in the flight a man was filmed swearing at another traveller several rows behind him before being urged to sit down by a woman. The recipient of his verbal barrage was stood next to an air steward who tried to calm the passenger down, only to be blasted with another volley of abuse as she walked towards the cockpit.    The woman who posted the footage said in a message: “Off to a eerrmmmm interesting start with this idiot abusing easyJet staff on our Ibiza flight. “Staff handled it very well and he was removed by police.” The incident happened on board easyJet flight EZY from London Stansted to Ibiza on Friday morning. The plane is thought to have landed at around .am. It was not immediately clearpolice had removed just one or more passengers, whether those removed were in the footage or what had caused the row. A spokesman for easyJet said: “We can confirm that flight EZY from London Stansted to Ibiza on  June was met by police on arrival in Ibiza due to a group of passengers behaving disruptively on board. “Our cabin crew are highly trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time.    “Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously and do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board. “The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always our highest priority.” The Civil Guard is not thought to have made any arrests. Problem passengers removed from flights by police in Spain are not normally formally arrested and instead have their details taken down so they can be reported for a breach of air security and fined. Last month a group of drunk Brits heading to Benidorm were filmed guzzling beer from a funnel on a Ryanair plane, with an air stewardess seeming to encourage them. The men took turns filming themselves chugging from the beer bong while on board the early morning flight from London Stansted to Alicante. One lad was filmed lying on his back in the aisle as his intoxicated mates poured the contents of two beer cans into the funnel at the top of the plastic tube he had inserted into his mouth and roared with laughter when it spilled over him.

Ben Carpenter has been dubbed a apossuper dadapos by his friends and family after becoming a dad of five having finalised the adoption of his son Noah. The -year-old from Huddersfield initially only wanted to adopt one child when he was -years-old. Ten years on Ben has a sizeable brood and doesnapost write off adopting more.    With a range of disabilities, his children, Jack, , Ruby, eight, Lily, six, Joseph, three, and Noah, one, all have complex needs, from autism to Pierre Robin syndrome. The full time dad said: Even at the age of  I knew I wanted to be a father as soon as possible - I may have only been young but Iaposve always had an old head on my shoulders. I was convinced with me being single as well that they wouldnapost take me seriously - but I was over the moon when they did. Due to previously working with disabled adults and children, I knew it was only right for me to adopt a disabled child because I knew Iaposd be able to care for them properly. I originally saw an advertisement from local adoption social services looking for adoptive parents and I thought, well, theyaposre not going to want me as a single guy.    But I told them who I was and where I worked and they were really positive and quite enthusiastic about me adopting a child. Nine years on, I have five children and I wouldnapost change a thing. Jack has autism, Ruby has Pierre Robin syndrome and limited use of her arms because of missing bones, Lily is deaf and Joseph has Down Syndrome. Noah has Cornelia de Lange syndrome which affect both his arms and legs. Ben says since he become part of the family itaposs like heaposs aposalways been thereapos.    The dad said: Noah is great and has fit in to our family just perfectly and, to be honest, itaposs like always been there. His new brothers and sisters are great with him, Lily in particular is extremely maternal and helps me feed Noah and things. The full time dad was never bothered about having biological children as he says adopting is just as good. Ben added: Iaposve never wanted biological children because thereaposs much, much more than just being biologically linked to a child. My children are my children - for example they have the same mannerisms as me.    Yes, the might not have the same blood as me, but who cares. I donapost currently plan on adopting more children but Iaposm one of these people who never says never. If in the future a child really needed me and my help, Iaposm sure I would end up adopting them. I definitely see myself fostering more children though - I just love being a dad. Ben explained how he instantly aposfell in loveapos with Noah when he first saw him and knew he needed to join his family.    The dad-of-five said: I was flicking through an adoption magazine that comes from monthly featuring children who are deemed as aposhard to placeapos children, when I came across this picture of a little baby boy who quite clearly had severe complex needs. I thought to myself aposthis little boy needs to join our family where he can be part of something specialapos, but more importantly someone who can accept him and his disability. I instantly fell in love with him what with his mass of brown hair and his beautul blue eyes I knew instantly I wanted him to be by son. Ben has remained single since the young age of  and doesnapost plan on looking for a relationship any time soon, with his dad duties being the most important thing to him.    He added: I have never sought a relationship, as I am happy on my own. Whenever I have at times visualised myself in a relationship and each time I have it always leads to the same conclusion: that my children will always come first. I would literally walk over hot coals to protect them and provide for them so itaposs very easy decision.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit.

Once this first phase is complete, the temporary lights will be removed, allowing the A to reopen to both lanes for the remainder of the summer.At nearby Glenkinglas, the excavated rock was used to construct six rock bunds across watercourse channels flowing down the slope towards the A. These bunds are up to m high in some sections and help form a barrier against any potential debris flows while allowing the water to pass beneath.In the autumn teams willto build the second phase of the catch-pit project, which will involve constructing a fth pit to the north of the first phase.Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland north-west representative, said: #As ever, we thank all road users for their continued patience while we work to construct these additional resilience measures on the A which will help to keep Argyll open for business, and our teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#"},{"url":null,"title":"iconic kilmartin venue set for racing return","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowRacing is set toto a Mid Argyll motorbike venue described as #the holy grail# of tracks.The track at Kilmartin famously hosted the only Scottish round of the  World Motocross Grand Prix championships in June  and memories remain vivid despite the fact no racing has taken place there for around three decades.The atmosphere will be electric when the Scottish Twin Shock Scramble Club holds round five of the  championship at the iconic Castle Park venue on June .Ricky Caldwell, chairman of the Scottish Twin Shock Scramble Club, said: #The idea behind the move was purely down to the iconic setting at Carnasserie Castle, Kilmartin, the holy grail venue of Scottish motocross.#When we were offered the opportunity to ride here again we had to make the effort to make it happen. With this in mind, the twinshock bikes which will be seen racing here would also have been racing at this venue in , so to revive this with our bikes seemed the natural thing to do.#The track is simple, natural, undulating land, not a man-made track but vintage scrambling motocross.#He added: #The championship this year is still really exciting as we are just approaching the midway point of the season.

Help offered by TSI might involve governance, fundraising and managing volunteers.With the closing of two TSI projects, the Guided Self-Help project and the Self-Directed Supporton September  last year, TSI has shted its approach to dealing with charities and vulnerable people.In a move that has seen six members of staff made redundant across Argyll and Bute and offices closing in Oban and, most recently, Lochgilphead, TSI has been criticised for taking staff #off the front line#.In a statement, TSI chief executive Kirsteen Murray said: #All staff affected by potential redundancy in the over-staffed areas were offered the opportunity to apply for vacant posts within the project.#Unfortunately we said goodbye to one full-time member of staff and two part-time at the end of September .#TSI has introduced a central telephone number and email address, a   self-serve facility on its website and travelling surgeries with  surgeries planned in Argyll and Bute across .Kirsteen Murray continued: #The feedback we have had has been excellent. Small numbers of organisations are accessing the self-serve facility and giving us positive feedback. Similarly, surgeries have proved popular in rural areas where small organisations appreciate us travelling to them.#Lochgilphead charities, though, have either not been informed of the change or claim the service is inadequate.Sandra Johnston, chairperson of four Mid Argyll charitable groups and a committee member of another three, said she had not been informed of the new phone line or website. She added: #The point of the TSI is to support local groups, which isn#t happening.#With them keeping on one member of staff in Lochgilphead # without any phone or office -there are no people to support the groups. The hands-on practical support isn#t there. It#s a very bad situation.##They have told me nothing. Between seven groups, I#ve not heard anything.#Common sense would tell them to send out letters to all the local groups. But they don#t understand who they#re working with. I#m lucky because I have people around me who can use a computer, some people don#t.#Mid Argyll councillor Dougie Philand said: #It is disappointing and concerning that TSI has closed its office in Lochgilphead, particularly when government legislation is becoming ever more dependent on TSI to provide services.#"},{"url":null,"title":"macbraynes bus spotted in ardrishaig","story":"Laura

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack.

These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal.

The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"the-15-best-places-in-scotland-to-have-a-picnic","story":". Loch Lubnaig, CallanderCallander, StirlingMeaning lsquocrookedrsquo in Gaelic, Loch Lubnaig is a far cry from the wide expanses of Loch Lomond or Loch Ness. But its narrow, weaving shape makes for a spectacular view from its banks, as the hills rise steeply ahead of you and peek around the corners of the horizon. There are plenty of flat, pebbly lochside beaches to plonk yourself down on, as well as dedicated picnic spots and the excellent Cabin Cafeacuteyou donrsquot want to bring your own food. And, along with admiring the scenery, you are also likely to see some hardy wild swimmers braving the water ndash no matter what time of year you visit.. Otterrsquos Pool, GallowayRaiderrsquos Road Forest Drive, Galloway Forest Park, Dumfries and GallowayOtterrsquos Pool almost looks made for picnics. The gently bubbling burn runs over rocks to pool in a charming forest clearing, with plenty of picnic tables dotted around to sit at and take in the surroundings. To get there, go halfway along the Raiderrsquos Road Forest Drive, a -mile woodland route that shows off some of the best wildle that Galloway has to offer.. Glenfinnan Viaduct Viewing Point, HighlandsGlenfinnan, Lochaber, HighlandsThe Glenfinnan Viaduct is recognisable the world over, thanks to the Harry Potter scene where the Hogwarts Express passes over its majestic arches. It makes a beautul spot for a picnic, with several dferent viewpoints that can be accessed from the visitor centre. ScotRail trains pass reasonably frequently on the route to Fort William, butyou want to see the iconic Jacobite steam train then you will have to time your picnic carefully as it only passes twice a day.. Conic Hill, BalmahaBalmaha, StirlingTherersquos nothing quite like the smug pleasure of tucking into a well-earned meal after exercise. And where better to do it than with a picnic at the top of Conic Hill  The summit of this steep, short peak offers some pretty spectacular views over Loch Lomond, and is the perfect place to just do nothing except soak in the scenery. The climb does require a bit of stamina, but it should be suitable for most ages and fitness levels.. Portencross, AyrshirePortencross, North AyrshireTroon and Prestwick might get most of the visitors, but those in the know would tell you that it is the clachan of Portencross that offers the best views in Ayrshire. Its proximity to Arran means it has an unrivalled outlook over the sea to the island ndash which looks particularly majestic as the sun is going down. You can head to one of the picnic tables dotted along the Portencross front, or to its small beach, but arguably the best place to base yourself is on the end of the pier.. Cambus OrsquoMay, AberdeenshireBallater, AberdeenshireThe erse, rich forest of Cambus OrsquoMay offers plenty of iety for visitors. You can picnic in the dense woodlandsyou want to get away from it all, in the open heather fieldsyou want a view of the Cairngorms, or at one of the riverside picnic benchesyou want to admire its suspension bridge. It was damaged in Storm Frank and is no longer safe to cross, but the -year-old bridge is still lovely to admire. Especially with a tasty picnic.. Botanic Gardens, Glasgow Great Western Road, GlasgowA bit of an institution among west-enders, the Botanic Gardens is an excellent place to unwind with a picnic on a sunny day. Any spot you choose is likely to be surrounded by beautul flowers, with the gardens hosting  specimens that come from more than  plant families. When you finish, make sure to have a wander around the striking Kibble Palace or the Kelvin riverside path to explore more of Glasgowrsquos greenery.. St Cyrus Beach, near MontroseMontrose, AngusThis three-mile-long beach, which is part of the St Cyrus Nature Reserve, has plenty of lovely spots for relaxing on a sunny day. You can get to it from the clf path or the visitor centre, where there is adjoining nature reserve to do some pre-picnic birdwatching. On the beach itself make sure to look out for seals, dolphins and killer whales, which have all been spotted offshore.. The Meadows, EdinburghOld Town, Edinburgh city centreIf you want a quiet, secluded picnic then the Meadows isnrsquot for you. But what it lacks in space it more than makes up for in people watching: with buskers, fitness fanatics, families and students all using the grassy fields for an escape from city le. Just be vigilant that you donrsquot have your food stolen by an over-friendly dog, or get hit by a stray frisbee from one of the many games that get played on the Meadows.. Fairy Pools, SkyeGlenbrittle, SkyeNot only was it named as Scotlandrsquos best picnic spot in , but Skyersquos Fairy Pools even made it on to the prestigious Lonely Planet list of the top  natural wonders of the world. If you want to see them for yourself, drive to the Forestry Commission car park of Glumagan Na Sithichean and then hike along the path for about  minutes until you reach the first of the waterfalls.

Be sure to leave time to explore the castle ndash and its beautul paintings ndash once you are finished.. Tentsmuir Forest, FeLeuchars, FeWith woodland, sand dunes and a beach, Tentsmuir has plenty of options for those looking to eat alfresco. There are dedicated picnic tables near the car park, but you can also follow one of the designated trails to find the perfect spot to set up camp. Look out for red squirrels, sea birds and dragonflies ndash and maybe even some seals basking on the beach.. Pollok Country Park, Glasgow Pollokshaws Road, GlasgowTo picnic alongside Highland cattle you might think that you have to travel to the countryside. But despite being right in the middle of Glasgowrsquos bustling south side, Pollok Park has its very own herd of Highland cows, along with plenty of open space and woodland. A great place to enjoy a picnic in peace.. Oldshoremore Beach, SutherlandKinlochbervie, SutherlandIf you want a picnic in peace, you canrsquot do much better than Oldshoremore beach. Along with its sister beach Phollain ndash the two are separated by a rocky isle known as Eilean na h-Aiteig ndash the south-facing bays of Oldshoremore can feel like your own private paradise.

The follow-up, the Talking Heads referencing Nite Le During Wartime, immortalises a moment during roughly the same period when Edinburgh was brought to le by its own characters.ldquoI have such great memories of the old days in Edinburgh, says the now London-based Lahbib. ldquoI was there the other day, and me and a friend had a wander around, and reminisced about the flats wersquod shared and the places we went to, and all the second-hand shops. All the clothes Irsquom wearing in the pictures in the book are second-hand, partly because thatrsquos all we could afford, but partly because everything then was about being original, and being creative.Also featured in Nite Le During Wartime are images of dancer and choreographer Michael Clark during the Edinburgh International Festival run of his ballet, I Am Curious Orange, featuring The Fall. There are shots too of Edinburgh post-punk irregulars such as Boots for Dancing, Fini Tribe and So You Think Yoursquore a Cowboy, as well as poet Paul Reekie.ldquoIt was the height of Thatcherrsquos Britain, says Lahbib, ldquoand itrsquos really interesting that in the picture Irsquom standing next to the sign, because as Irsquove got older, saving the NHS is one of the things Irsquove become passionate about. So even though I probably wasnrsquot that politically aware at the time, itrsquos had an effect.Lahbib originally trained as a dancer, and spent four years at ballet school. By the time the image adorning the cover of Nite Le During Wartime was taken, she had made her onscreen debut in the title role of Cary Parkerrsquos piece of big-screen s Glasgow whimsy, The Girl in the Picture. Although the part was small, it gave her the taste for something more.Rather than capitalise on her film experience straight away, Lahbib decided to learn her craft, and studied drama at Queen Margaret College in Edinburgh. Early stage work included Wildcatrsquos production of Oh, What a Lovely War, with stints on Taggart before she moved to London. Once there, she was cast as a regular in long-running London TV soap, London Bridge. From there she moved into cop show Thief Takers before appearing alongside Forbes Masson and Stephen McCole in Skins creator Brian Elsleyrsquos mini-series, The Young Personrsquos Guide to Being a Rock Star.Lahbib moved into the mainstream by way of three series of Bad Girls, before joining Monarch of the Glen and appearing opposite Robson Green in Wire in the Blood. Lahbib also ran a performing school for young people. This led to her founding a childrenrsquosrsquo acting agency after one of her charges, Dylan McKiernan, was cast in Ken Loachrsquos film, I, Daniel Blake. Lahbibrsquos now thirteen-year-old daughter, Skye, meanwhile, has appeared in several seriesrsquo of Grantchester, playing her mumrsquos former co-star Robson Greenrsquos daughter. Lahbib also co-runs her own producing house, Contro Vento, with her husband, actor Raffaella Degruttola, with several films under their belt.Now back acting and producing full time, for Lahbib, Nite Le During Wartime is a step into a time when she and her generation were on the cusp of making it.ldquoGoing round all my old haunts and seeing Innesrsquo pictures has taken me back, she says. ldquoThere were all these people having fun, having adventures and doing these creative things that were about to take off.

Over there in the corner, he says, is the alpha male, and that pigeon on the perch by the window is the stray whorsquos wondered in from somewhere . There are also some new birds, imported from Belgium that were sent over as chicks and have settled in well. Their claws clatter on the wood and they settle down again. Therersquos about  of them in all.The obvious question to ask Donny and his we Linda, whorsquos also a pigeon enthusiast, is: why do they love these birds so much  And therersquos a second obvious question: why do so many people hate pigeons with just as much passion  Another striking trend has been seen in recent years: a hobby, pigeon keeping, that was once one of the most popular in the country has declined precipitously. There were once a quarter of a million pigeon fanciers in Britain now there are some ,yoursquore lucky. Still a large number, but not a patch on what it was.: great places to enjoy Scotlands peerless wildleDonny and Linda Brooks have seen the change for themselves at their home in Wishaw. They point out of the loft across the line of houses on their street. There used to be a pigeon loft in virtually every garden, says Linda, but now therersquos just theirs. Donny says it was the same in Cumbusnethan, the nearby mining village where he grew up. ldquoA lot of the miners had pigeons, he says. ldquoIt was a working manrsquos sport but now there is an anti-pigeon mood. The phrase lsquoflying ratsrsquo stuck.So maybe itrsquos time to ditch that terrible phrase, flying rats, and replace it with something  that reflects the true, remarkable nature of pigeons. Linda says any animal can be a nuisancetheyrsquore in the ldquowrong place, but she sees the gentle joy of them every day. ldquoI miss them when theyrsquore not at the back door, she says, ldquobecause theyrsquore communicators. They talk to each other. You can hear them having their wee conversations.Another pigeon fancier who feels the same way is the writer Jon Day. Jon has just written a book about pigeons, Homing, which follows his efforts to establish a loft and breed racers, but he also explores the extraordinary and often mysterious qualities of the birds. They are miniature jump jets, he says, capable of accelerating from - miles per hour in under two seconds, but they are also just as intelligent as great apes, dolphins and elephants. But whatrsquos really fascinating is how they find their way home.ldquoItrsquos an enduring and controversial biological mystery, says Jon when I call him at his home in east London. ldquoMost of the consensus seems to be that itrsquos essentially a suite of dferent and fairly mysterious navigational senses that we may or may not possess.ldquoTherersquos certainly a lot of evidence that pigeons can detect the earthrsquos magnetic field, but they need to be able to smell in order to find their way home from an unfamiliar place and whatrsquos so amazing and beautul about that is not that theyrsquore smelling their way home ndash as we might with the smell of bacon through the house ndash itrsquos that the winds, when they blow from dferent directions, bring with them the sense of a base note and the pigeons can use the changing intensities of those base odours to work out where they have been taken in relation to their loft. Lots of the racers I meet have a sense of wonder and amazement at that fact ndash that this tiny, g creature can perform such impossible and mysterious actions.However, like Donny and Linda Brooks, Jon Day feels that a prejudice has built up against pigeons in recent years. Partly, he says, itrsquos because we have become much more house proud and people are less willing to tolerate their neighbours having pigeon lofts in their gardens. Keeping pigeons also requires a big commitment ndash itrsquos expensive but you do have to be at home quite a lot of the time to let them in and out of the loft. So, in many ways, keeping pigeons just isnrsquot compatible with modern le.Jon thinks therersquos something  going on as well ndash something more profound: some people love pigeons, and some people hate them because theyrsquore a bit like us. ldquoPigeons seem to mimic human behaviour, he says, ldquoso the place where they grow up generally becomes their home for the rest of their lives and they have this very human, it seems to me, relationship with a place. But theyrsquore also these kind of opportunistic, parasitic creatures that live in our spaces and environment and thatrsquos one of the reasons theyrsquore reviled. They remind us slightly of ourselves.Jon also thinks that what humans can see in pigeons helps explain why the popularity of racing pigeons has declined. In the early part of the th century, the birds were a vital form of communication and carrying messages from the battlefields made them heroes during the First and Second World War. However, Jon believes that, for the working class men that made up most of the pigeon racing community, their birds used to offer a kind of imaginative travelling that they couldnrsquot do in reality. Then air fares became more affordable and the pigeon fanciers could travel for themselves. They didnrsquot need their birds to do it for them and so slowly the lofts were shut up.: great places to enjoy Scotlands peerless wildleJon, and Donny and Linda Brooks, have all felt this sense of vicarious freedom in caring for their birds. Jon speaks about the joy of sitting in his garden in east London with a cup of tea and watching his birds flying overhead all the way through his book he also takes an imaginative flight with the birds, following their mysterious instincts as they race from Thurso in the far north to Leyton in the far south:  hours,  miles, their wings beating three times a second, their homing beacon taking them home.This freedom the birds have is important to every fancier, especially because there are some people who think keeping pigeons is cruel. In his book, Jon describes the methods some fanciers will use to win races ndash culling birds that havenrsquot performed well during the season, for instance. Donny Brooks also admits that there are some ruthless keepers out there. Not only that, the birds are at risk from predators in the air and on the ground and Linda Brooks tells me that, in any one year, they will lose a third to a half of their flock this way.When I ask him about it, Jon Day says that, in the end, he wasnrsquot prepared to use any of the tougher methods on his birds, but both he and Linda and Donny Brooks vehemently deny that pigeon keeping is cruel. ldquoWhen you open the loft, says Donny, ldquoitrsquos up to the bird whether it wants to go out or not and when it goes out,it wants to stay out, thatrsquos it. Yoursquore rearing a creature that wants to stay with you yoursquore its home and its keeper. In order to make a pigeon want to come home, you have to create a home that it wants to come back to.Jon agrees with this. ldquoI thought a lot about the ethics of the sport as I am a meat eater and a fisherman, he says. ldquoBut pigeons are free to do what they like when theyrsquore liberated so although I can see that people have objected to the sport, whatrsquos really being celebrated is a relationship that would otherwise die out and I donrsquot think itrsquos cruel. It has risks, as does horse racing and dog racing, and I suppose people who object to animal human interactions as being inherently exploitative might well have things to say about that. But every time you open the loft, the pigeons are free to leave and go away.Jon also believes that the men and women who love pigeon racing ndash mostly men, it has to be said ndash are reminding us not to take the species for granted. We might grumble about them now and complain about their mess and put up spikes to deter them or string that gets tangled round their feet, but shouldnrsquot we stop this stupid and cruel behaviour  Pigeons might not always be here.ldquoIrsquom conscious of the fact that these things look as though they are constants but that might not be true and we should step back, says Jon. ldquoPassenger pigeons were this hugely populous species of pigeon, mainly in north America. Up until the th century, there were flocks of up to a million but within a couple of decades they were wiped out by hunting. And they had a similar reputation in the public imagination as the feral pigeon.What Jon hopes is that, in time, we can rehabilitate the reputation of all pigeons and see them as their admirers do. As a survivor, like humans. As an almost perfect example of natural design. As a remarkable little jump jet that can hit  miles per hour in two seconds.ldquoIrsquom quite struck by the ferocity of anti-pigeon sentiment, among not just urban dwellers, says Jon, ldquobut often among people who love birds who see them as a devastating mono-culture who come and dominate. Jon believes, though, that there are ways we can learn to live together better and cites experiments in some European cities where large lofts have been built to encourage the pigeons to nest where they will not be a nuisance.ldquoOne of the reasons feral pigeons have been so successful in an urban context, he says, ldquois the fact they see our homes as their homes. Sowersquore going to build cities, we need to acknowledge that other creatures will live alongside us.Jon also points out that, while pigeon racing may be in decline in Britain, in other parts of the world itrsquos thriving: Morocco for instance and China, where earlier this year a buyer paid poundmillion for a prized pigeon. As for the chances of a revival here, Jon is not so sure.ldquoPeople donrsquot have the time or inclination to care for birds in their gardens, he says. ldquoYou have to be there and fly them twice a day, you have to train them and keep an eye on their health. And itrsquos not the most exciting spectator sport it has to be said ndash yoursquore not there at the start you just wait and eventually the pigeons turn up or not.However, one of the greatest joys of keeping pigeons for Jon is taking the imaginative journey, and he urges the rest of us to do the same. Play a game, he says, the next time you see a group of pigeons. Imagine where they may have been or where they may be going. Also, take a look at their legs to seeyou can spot a ring that singles them out as racers. Perhaps the bird is taking a rest before the homing instinct kicks in again. Perhaps hersquos decided to join a dferent flock and will never head home ndash it sometimes happens. But as you look at the pigeons, remember that an animal isnrsquot worthy of our attention and admiration just because itrsquos rare. There is beauty and wonder in the familiar too.Homing: On Pigeons, Dwellings and Why We Return by Jon Day is published by John Murray at pound.."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9989436.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbc-question-time-viewers-praise-speech-from-francesca-martinez","story":"The -year-old, who has cerebral palsy,slammed thegovernment for having \"blood on its hands\" during an impassioned two-minute speech on the show.:BBC Question Time criticised over balance as  show visits ElginShe also hit out at the Conservative Government and Boris Johnson overcuts to disability benefits, describing them as absolutely outrageous.In her speech, she said: \"The biggest reason I am not a fan of Boris is he has backed austerity policies, again and again.\"Austerity has caused the death of , human beings in Britain.

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"explorer scouts raise over 1k at fun dog show event","story":"The Daviot and Oldmeldrum Explorer Scouts kicked off fundraising for their second trip to volunteer at a school in Uganda at the weekend.The group held their annual Fun Dog Show in Oldmeldrum on Sunday, June .The event raised around £,.At the Fun Dog Show there was a choice of ten classes and over  dogs took part.The DOM Explorer Scouts ran a tea and cake tent whilst a number of local pet-related businesses had stalls.The Scratch Club from Inverurie ran Flyball demonstations and also let people try with their own dogs.The DOM Explorer Scouts were supported by a number of local businesses who sponsored the event.They hope to hold the next Fun Dog Show on Sunday, June  .In July  the DOM Explorer Scouts visited Ruhanga in SW Uganda to help finish building a School  Scout Hall that they had funded.

But there’s also a softer side to this alpha male, and back home in Hawick, as he talks about his children, losing his best friend and his pride in his home town, he’s not afraid to let his emotions show. It’s easy to see why he’s a face of Dove Men+Care, the skincare brand’s global initiative to promote men as non-violent fathers and caregivers, celebrating a definition of strength with care at its core. “Whatever you see on the pitch, everybody’s got a soft heart,” says Hogg. “Andnot, you’re doing something wrong.”Known as a bag-of-tricks player who can create tries and passes from nowhere, Hogg has a magic that saw JK Rowling bestowing wizard status on him in a Tweet. With the skills of a stand-off when required, the -year-old fullback is best in the back three and, with Finn Russell, is one of the talismans of the Scottish side. Hogg has just come to the end of a nine-year stint at Glasgow Warriors and is bound for Exeter Chiefs this summer. In the meantime he’s having a few weeks’ well-earned break at home, swapping hitch-kicks for kickback.With pre-season training, games for his country against France and Georgia and the Rugby World Cup in Japan ahead, he has his hands full on the pitch. And off too, because the fullback is a big family man and this Father’s Day Archie, three and a half, Olivia, two, and six-month-old George will be keeping him on the run. Never mind Leinster in the Guinness PRO final or the auld enemy at Twickenham, the mini Hogg squad have every bit as much bounce as one of their dad’s drop kicks. “The big thing is routine and preparation,” he says.Ah yes, that’s key with children. Oh wait, he’s talking about rugby.“Yeah, as soon as you get that spot-on in terms of training and schedules, you’re half-way to success and the big thing is getting a routine that includes the kids too. They balance off each other really well and it works for both. “The only thing I maybe struggle with is on match days when I’m trying to concentrate on the game ahead and there’s a job with the kids to do. But we’ve been working on that,” he says. “We’re not going to get everything perfect, and things are not always going to run smoothly,” he laughs. “But as long as the kids are happy and I’m performing, that’s all I can ask for.”“We” is Hogg and his we Gillian, also a Hawick native. The pair have been married for three years, and together for seven, after Hogg persuaded the daughter of family friends to date him. “We eventually got together,” he says. “After a few months of chasing her, she eventually caved in, thankfully, and we’ve been together ever since.”Chasing her  She must be fastshe can out-run Hogg He laughs. “It was more just not replying to my messages!”But persistence is another Hogg quality, as is resilience, something he’s shown in coming back after injuries to his shoulder and ankle, not to mention shrugging off concussion in his last match with the Warriors, where he was carried off the pitch with  minutes to go. “That was a bit disappointing when you’re in touching distance of winning, but look, it’s happened now, and I’ve just got to get on with my job.”Getting on with the job means the move to Exeter this summer, and leaving the town where he grew up, steeped in the rugby tradition.“It was time for me to move on and challenge myself outwith Scottish rugby and the timing was spot on for Gill and the kids. As a family we’re excited because we’ve always wanted to experience new things and challenge ourselves in dferent environments. I don’t look too far ahead, but when I come to the end of my career, I want to turn round and say, ‘I’m glad I tried that’ as opposed to, ‘I wish I’d tried that.’Hawick will always be home for us, and it will be dficult to leave, tough moving further afield. In terms of leaving Scottish rugby, I’ll be forever grateful for the opportunity to become a professional and live the le I’m living. And it’s about learning new things to bring back to Scotland and try to improve the national game as well – we’re in a good place now and hopefully we’re going to continue to rise. It’s exciting times for Scotland, and me.”At this stage in his career and with a young family is it time for Hogg to cash in anyway  “No, If we were interested in the financial side of the game we’d be going to France, but that disnae really excite me,” he says.Speaking of exciting times for Scotland, with the Rugby World Cup coming up in Japan in September, as one of the team’s poster boys Hogg appears a shoo-in to be in the squad. But he’s not taking his place on the plane for granted. “There’s a long old pre-season to go through first,” he says, “and a huge amount of competition for places. There’s no bigger tournament in world rugby, so here’s hoping I can get out there and try and achieve something special. We start off with Ireland. We’ve shown we can beat them, so here’s hoping we can perform on the day.”Hogg is big on the cameraderie of the game, on and off the pitch, and emphasises the importance of bonding to how a team plays. “That’s a big part of rugby culture. You work incredibly hard but you enjoy each other’s company after the game – and enjoy a couple of quiet beers,” he says. And certainly, his focus for Japan is all about the training and games, not the down time.So he won’t be hogging the mic in the karaoke bars He laughs. “Thankfully I’m one of the more experienced boys in the team nowadays and you don’t necessarily have to sing all the time. It’s mainly bullying the younger boys into entertaining us,” he jokes. “But,ever asked upon to sing, I have a few so I’ll… butcher a song and get booed.”For Hogg it was always going to be rugby, born into a rugby family and raised in a town famous for rugby – although technically he was born in Melrose at Borders General Hospital – “brought back to Hawick as quick as we possibly could,” he is keen to point out. After a rugby course at Borders College he joined Glasgow and went through their Academy, turning pro at . His dad John played for Hawick, coached and refereed professionally and his brother Graham also played the game.“It was Graham who gave me the ambition to become a rugby player after following him for several years,” he says. His mother Margaret has always worked in property, and when his dad wasn’t on the rugby pitch, he was working at Johnstons of Elgin as a knitwear technician, the details of which have been lost on Hogg. “Knitwear technician  I’ve no idea. I worked there too in my first job in the school holidays, packing boxes – that was an eye-opener,” he says and discreetly neglects to say why, adding “and recently I’ve done a clothing line for them, SWH, which I really enjoyed.”It’s through his father that Hogg is distantly related to George Best, something that makes him laugh when it’s raised. “I can never remember the exact relation, but my “dad knows. He always wanted to find out his fa mily history, so he did and we’ve caught up with the Irish family, who are absolutely brilliant.”Does he ever ponder the Best experience of working as a professional sportsman and coping with le in the spotlight “Everybody’s dferent,” he says. “For me it’s about making sure I stay grounded and provide for my family. Rugby’s a short career and you’ve got to try and make the most of it. It’s about learning other things off the field to make the transition from professional sport because you never know when it’s going to end.I’m really interested in property with my mum, and also the punditry side of the game. I love rugby, I love speaking rugby, and I’d love to still be involved in some way. Hopefully I’ll play until I’m about , , but you never know when it’s going to end.”Another clue to Hogg’s caring side can be seen in his signature scoring celebration of forming a “W” with his hands. It’s a tribute to his friend Richard Wilkinson, who was killed when the car in which they were both teenage passengers crashed. “I’ve said all along I’m gonnae take Richard along the journey that I’m living because he could quite easily be in my position and I’ll continue to take him along my career.”The le-changing experience in  also spurred Hogg to become involved with the Road Safety Scotland campaign to cut the number of deaths on rural roads. “We’re trying to make people aware of what’s on country roads andit gets the message across and saves lives, we’re doing our job.”Wilkinson is also represented among the many tattoos with which Hogg’s body is decorated. “I love them,” he says. “I’ve got one on the arm, the kids’ names down the ribs, my best mate’s initials on my ribs, lots of dferent bits and pieces. I’m trying to make it a story of my le and what’s happened to me, something I’m proud of and I’ll continue doing it. They’re agony,” he says, man enough to admit it, “but I love ‘em,” At the top of his game, Hogg can look forward to more career and le highlights to commemorate in ink, and he’s happy to be a role model for the next generation of players. “I think that’s part of being a rugby player. It’s about inspiring the next generation. “I’ll always remember being a little kid and professional rugby players coming to the club and Kelly Brown and Nikki Walker coming to my school. So when people come and speak to me and want signatures, it could be my th, but it might be that person’s first. And that’s something I remember. If you get too big for your boots, especially in a place like Hawick, you’ll get knocked back down pretty quickly. For me it’s about making sure there are players who want to play for Hawick and Scotland, making sure rugby in the future is in the right place. And I take great pride in doing it because I remember being that kid.” Speaking of kids it’s time for Hogg to get back to his, but not before sharing a final comment that sums up his ability to combine his personal and professional le.“The best thing is after the game when they come on the pitch and you get to share those precious moments with them. Those are my favourite times.”When men care, everyone benefits, andHogg’s right and being a good father makes him a better player, it’s a win-win for his family and Scottish rugby.Happy Father’s Day from Dove Men+Care, and their Scottish Rugby ambassador, Stuart Hogg.

My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph.

Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.What does horses have to do with speedsterIm not defending speeding. Im saying this is the safest bit of road we have for overtaking and saying that youcannot possibly know the speed of the other cars without measuring equipment.Engine power is expressed in horsepower and lots of horsepower enables some to be faster than others going up hills than others.Haydn I have driven small cars which feel like they need a push going up our hills, that is all.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case .."},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

However, underlying issues of majority and binary decision-making processes, and the resulting exclusion of certain voices, are ones that have dogged the institutions since the formation of the Northern state. It is this same system of binary voting that has further polarised opinions and furthered tension in the wake of the Brexit vote. Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bubbles.png","title":"siomha wows buble","story":"A -year-old Coláiste Feirste pupil wowed Canadiansinging superstar Michael Bublé with her vocal talent at his sell-out concert inthe city on Monday night.

This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion. It’s been  years and we are about to have a whole new generation come to see it.”A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre from June -.

He now says he favours a renegotiation of the agreement and wants the backstop to be surrounded by an unambiguous \"exit mechanism\". Has also said that a rebooted Executive Assembly would help to resolve matters and indicated that he would even lead the talks process. Described Karen Bradley as a \"brilliant\" Secretary of State.Success Rating:  Matt HancockA slightly woollier version of Goves position. He wants a time limit on the backstop, although doesnt indicate how long short the limit would be. He has also suggested that a new political negotiations body of some sort - involving Northern Irelands parties - could be established to create North South consensus on a way forward.Success Rating:  Read MoreWho are the contenders in the Tory leadership race Boris Johnson is ‘yesterday’s news’, says Tory rival Sajid JavidMark HarperA former chief whip with a reasonably good nose for what the parliamentary party might gather around, he supported the Malthouse Compromise. This emerged in January and involves the backstop being redrafted as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Would want to breathe new le into it. The DUP supports the compromise.Success Rating:  Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJeremy HuntAlong with Johnson and Gove, considered one of the three most likely to win . He is of the view that the European Unions negotiating team has accepted that the backstop, or something very similar to the backstop, will not get through Parliament. But he hasnt set out an alternative to the backstop. Hard to knowhe hasnt actually got an alternative at this point, orhe is just keeping his powder dry until he gets to the final two.Success Rating:  Sajid Javid\"I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament - that was the withdrawal agreement - with a change to the backstop. What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. I think it could be done in a couple of years.\" There is no evidence that he has even had below-the-radar discussions with either Ireland or the EU about his proposals.Success Rating:  Boris JohnsonNobody knows what Johnson will do. He excoriated the withdrawal agreement and the backstop at the DUPs conference last November and then voted for it a few weeks later. Has yet to explain how he will replace the backstop, let alone discuss avoiding the potential damage to UK Irish and North South relationshipshe fails to renegotiate the present agreement and the UK exits without a deal.Success Rating:  Andrea LeadsomHer parliamentary reputation has grown over the last two years, particularly while she was Leader of the House. More flexible than she is often given credit for, she speaks of a \"managed exit\" as opposed to a full-scale renegotiation and believes the backstop problem could be resolved with a \"sensible\" trade deal and \"technological oversight\" re the border.Success Rating:  Esther McVeyProbably the most hardline Brexiteer candidate and the one most likely to prioritise a no-deal over a renegotiation. Thats because she doesnt think the EU will reopen full-scale negotiations. The DUP wouldnt admit it, but itd rather she didnt win. The party talks tough on a no-deal outcome, but is well aware of the huge damage a no-deal could do to political institutional dynamics in Northern Ireland. Luckily for it, she has no chance.Success Rating:  Dominic RaabThe former Cabinet minister with \"responsibility for exiting the EU\" lasted only four months in the job: and didnt distinguish himself by his admission that he hadnt quite understood the full extent of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais route. He also supported the Malthouse Compromise.Success Rating:  Rory StewartThe only genuine wildcard in the leadership race. His brutal, quirky honesty allows him to say things like \"stop pretending the EU will be willing to renegotiate the current backstop arrangement\". Would probably try and push the withdrawal agreement through after a new round of talks with the other parties. Would not be comfortable with a renewed parliamentary arrangement with the DUP.Success Rating:  "},{"url":null,"title":"anxious wait for family as river search for woman continues","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is a story in that in itself.“I am saying ‘absolutely not, I am meeting you in public’ [To Mr Bell]. And him saying ‘the story I am about to give you here will be the biggest story you will ever had’.”Nolan did not expand on why McGuinness was at his home.Mr Bell was suspended by the DUP in December  after giving an interview to Nolan about the scheme. He made explosive claims that DUP special advisers were reluctant to introduce cost control tarfs to the scheme.The Renewable Heat Incentive scheme was an green energy initiative set up to encourage businesses in Northern Ireland to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy.The so-called “cash-for-ash” scandal exposed the taxpayer to a huge overspend by paying out more in subsidies than the fuel was worth.As a result of the scandal a public inquiry, chaired by Sir Patrick Coghlin, was launched to investigate.

However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James McKnight."},{"url":null,"title":"derry woman appointed managing director global strategy consultancy firm","story":"A Derry woman has been appointed to the role of Managing Director at a leading firm specialising in leadership strategy.Tessa Breslinassumed the role in recent weeks and will now head up YSC’s Americas Division spanning the United States, Brazil, Canada and Mexico.YSC Consulting uses their expertise in behavioural science to help organisations across the globe connect the dots between business strategy and leadership.

The Down defence was performing exceptionally well at this stage, but they had a nightmare finish to the first half.Despite defending in numbers, Down lost their shape and points from Josh Casey, Liam McGrath and Conor Sweeney sent Tipperary into the break with a - to - lead.Down now had the wind behind them in the second half and Havern reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play. This was quickly cancelled out with a free from McGrath before a Harrison point left two points between the sides.Havern and Sweeney exchanged scores before the mighty Quinn got involved.His influence on the game was immediate and an early point settled him into the pace of the game, his score leaving a point in it with  minutes remaining.Down fired a couple of wides before Burns produced his game-changing save. OrsquoHare seized the moment and he drilled the ball to the back of the net in the th minute after a bit of ping-pong in the Tipperary square.Down now had a - to - lead, but Liam Casey left the minimum in it yet again when he spilt the posts with a great score.Quinn and Quinlavin swapped scores before Quinn and Paul Devlin gave Down a - to - lead with only two minutes remaining.Conor Sweeney threw Tipperary a leline with a converted free, but with five additional minutes to be played, Down patiently held on to the ball and Barry OrsquoHagan completed the scoring when he restored his sidersquos three point lead in added time.Down: Rory Burns , Brendan McArdle, Darren OrsquoHagan , Gerard Collins, Ryan McAleenan, Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness, Johnny Flynn, Conor Poland, Conor Francis, Pat Havern , James Guinness, Jerome Johnston , Donal OrsquoHare , Connaire Harrison .

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

I think there was a bit more hunger from the Down team, especially in turning balls over and tackling. They showed a greater desire to win the game.Slowly, but surely Downrsquos players are starting to buy into Tallyrsquos revolution.Goalkeeper Rory Burns is a natural between the posts. He exudes confidence with his handling and his kick-outs are rarely wasted.The full back line of Darren OrsquoHagan, who negated the threat of former All Star Michael Quinlivan, the recalled Benny McArdle and Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins were immense.Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness and Ryan McAleenan threw a brick wall up in front of the back three and made scores extremely hard to come by for Tipperary.A fit again Jonny Flynn was a colossus in the middle of the park and more than held his own against the highly-rated Steven OrsquoBrien.Conor Polandrsquos physicality was much-needed in the engine room and Conor Francisrsquo non-stop running frustrated the le out of Tipperary.The Down forwards all kept going when forced to live off crumbs, but it was the introduction of Mayobridgersquos Cory Quinn that really caught the imagination.The  year-old forward has been the scourge of every defender on the county club scene since the start of the season and he is now starting to show that sort of form for Tally.The pocket rocket has pace, power and an eye for scores. Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station. She is also closely connected with Strangford Coastal Rowing Club and has been a member of the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Originally from Scotland, but now living in Ballyculter, near Strangford, Isabel says she has had an ldquoabiding interest in environmental issues since being a young student at Glasgow University.For more than two decades she managed the F H Ebbitt residential outdoor education centre in Bryansford where she developed many programmes and activities for adults and young people.After early retirement from the education centre, Isabel has been a lecturer in environmental subjects with the Open University.Isabelrsquos philosophy of environmental education has always been to provide an interpretation of complex ecological and environmental concepts without compromising scientic integrity.She says she has always been more interested in finding out the why of things, rather than simply listing sightings.An involvement with Mourne and Strangford Lough management has allowed her to broaden her repertoire of education and information to community programmes and work in local environmental management.In  Isabel met and fell in love with a classic yacht built in .

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

At the end of lap one you could see cracks starting to appear in all the groups.Eddie Doyle could be seen grimacing and cracking the whip in his group with the smell of money on lap five just too tempting.A large scratch group, who would normally race through like a well-oiled machine, seemed to be under a bit of pressure as Watson, Montgomery and McKee started to hit the front. It wasnrsquot long before scratch group had split completely and the three men were on their own.By lap four they were a mere  seconds from catching the last group ahead of them and it was then that McKee would lose contact and fall back to what was left of a scratch group.Behind, racers would try to put groups together as pretty much everybody looked like they were trying far too hard. No one had an easy ride in the bunch with no rest on this course. Laura Wylie would show her form holding on to her fast group until the final laps to take the first female prize. Martina Hawkins was pushing for performance of the night as, having made a slow start, would pick up positions as the lapped ticked by and would take second female.At the head of the race Monty and Watson would push each other to the limit with neither giving an inch.

Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the

unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8803916.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business students","story":"Final year business students from South

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The young kits born in the school enclosures will then be released by NIEA into specially selected sites across Northern Ireland to bolster existing colonies.The pupils of St Francis PS know how to grow foodThe passion of Mr Coleman has inspired the children to such an extent that they have received letters of support and enthusiasm from Sir David Attenborough.The allotments, half of which are for the pupils to grow produce, are also rented by members of the community at a small surcharge and with the proviso that they come and help clean up around the school.Video: Timeline and CCTV of

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG. Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
