She is single and lives in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, with her 18-month old cat Pandora. She says:I wanted a British Blue because I lived in an upstairs flat and thought it would be unfair to get a rescue cat that would want to go outdoors. Pandora loves her home comforts.She’s very independent, but loyal. If I move from one room to another, she’ll follow me. She sleeps on her back with her paws in the air, which is hilarious. I’ve never seen that in any of the cats I’ve owned.Although she’s still young and has energetic, kittenish moments she’s quite lazy, too. I bought her for £650 when she was 13 weeks old. It’s a lot of money but I saved up because I knew I wanted this breed.One of her tricks is playing fetch like a dog. She has a little stick toy with a feather on it and if you throw it she’ll bring it back — but only if she wants to play. Everything is on her terms.I get so many comments about her, particularly about her amber eyes. Her coat is very dense, almost like velvet, and I brush it every day.She sheds but I keep it under control.I’d read this breed could be clumsy and didn’t believe it until I got one. She doesn’t like to jump on things and if she does, she’ll have a bit of a wobble at the top.In the event, we were so grateful for the joy they brought, at a time when we were otherwise monosyllabic with sadness.

He’s greedy and we have to ensure we don’t feed him too much.

They’re very laid back, don’t need much grooming and are no fuss.I have four adults and also four kittens (one called Woody is pictured) which I’ve bred to sell on. I’ll be keeping one of them. I have been breeding for about five years. I sell the kittens for around £650.Other breeders, particularly in London can charge up to £900. If someone has brought a new cat in from Russia or Eastern Europe to ‘refresh the breeding line’ they can charge around £1,800.I love the colour. They can be anything from the palest grey blue to the darkest blue. But it’s their gorgeous copper eyes like autumn leaves that I find most beautiful.As house cats they prefer to be indoors although I have a cat run if they ever want to escape on a really hot day.

Until now.For the Prince of Wales has given a mouthwatering insight into what sets his taste buds tingling by revealing that his ‘favourite recipe’ is . . . pheasant crumble pie.And the heir to the throne likes eating game birds so much he has ‘invented’ a possible successor to that dish’s place in his affections — a moussaka made with grouse, instead of the usual lamb, which he calls ‘groussaka’.His craving for such culinary creations will be revealed in next Wednesday’s edition of Country Life magazine that he is guest editing to mark his 70th birthday, which falls on that very same day. In it, Charles tells how he owes his fondness for pheasant crumble pie to a friend, saying: ‘I got this recipe from someone I know. It is delicious.’He goes on to say: ‘I invented a grouse one recently, coq au vin with grouse, as well as moussaka with grouse (it doesn’t always have to be lamb), in other words groussaka!’The feature, titled My Favourite Recipe, includes an interview with John Williams, the executive chef at The Ritz in London, and the recipe for pheasant crumble pie, along with photographs of Mr Williams preparing it.

Pheasant. Crumble. Pie. Surely it’s either a crumble or a pie, but it can’t be both?After poaching, you cool and shred the pheasant meat (breasts only), strain and reduce the stock, then spike it with sherry. After making a roux with flour and butter, you use the stock to make a thick white sauce. Then you mix it all together, top with breadcrumbs, cheese and bacon before baking in the oven. It sounds ine! Not having the Ritz kitchens, a palace or a personal chef at my disposal, I decide to make it myself. After all, what could possibly go wrong?So I order a pheasant from C Lidgate, the prestigious West London butchers beloved of royals and Richard Branson, but don’t let that put you off. It comes from Norfolk although not the Sandringham Estate, but that is close enough for me. I poach it as instructed, then boil the stock to reduce.Neither Mr Williams nor Prince Charles mention the scum that gathers on the surface, as is usual when boiling fowl. Perhaps you just can’t have that word in a royal recipe? I skim my scum surreptitiously.The breadcrumbs are an outrageous extravagance, fried in 170g of butter, almost three-quarters of a pack. Even after drying them, they are still a mound of engorged butter bombs. To intensify the decadence, parmesan cheese and crispy bacon are added, before the dish is baked in the oven.So what does it taste like? Really rather delicious, although it is incredibly rich. Savoury, soothing and surprisingly economical, it is exactly the kind of comfort food one might expect the Prince of Wales to adore.

They have tremendous loyalty to both parents and learn early on to navigate between the two camps.They hate to hear their parents slagging off each other and generally decide that total discretion is the wisest modus vivendi – rarely telling one parent anything about their time with the other.I remember freaking out when I learnt, through a third party, that my son Sam, then six years old, had slept in his father’s Majorcan bar during his stay with him. But Sam never mentioned it to me, nor seemed particularly put out when I raised the topic.Children are very accepting of each parent’s character and, as they grow up, instinctively understand their respective strengths and weaknesses.There have been countless times when, annoyed as I may have been with my ex, I have known that he would have a better take than me on one of our child’s worries. At moments like this, shared responsibility is a relief.Divorced parenting is never easy but the best thing you can do for your kids is to try to ensure they have an equally strong relationship with both parents. This is far more likely to be achieved if their custody isn’t entrusted to only one – and they aren’t fought over like a property portfolio.Christmas cookies make me crumbleThe Christmas Lakeland catalogue arrived this week, triggering my first bout of seasonal low self-esteem.The pages are filled with products for the kind of festive home that I have never achieved.Are there really people who whip up gingerbread Christmas trees and Nutcracker soldier cookies?

But they are having to do it without Posh Spice, who has refused to join in. And no wonder. For Victoria Beckham those takings are chicken feed, and why would she want to revisit the past? There comes a point where a Wannabe becomes a Hasbeen.When I interviewed Victoria in 2008 for her first Vogue cover story, she was performing in the last Spice Girls tour.She invited me and my family to come to the show and welcomed us into her dressing room where, as David fixated on his phone, she was done up in full Posh regalia – squeezed into a shiny bronze catsuit, caked in fake tan with a stiff helmet of hair gel and tottering around in platform shoes that make her normal stilettos look like comfy slippers. Ten years later her world has moved on and she is now a sophisticated fashion designer whose every public appearance is an advert for her business.Any hint of a latex catsuit could kill that hard-won brand image stone dead.

Personally, I’m all for women being able to wear as little or as much as they are comfortable in and have no problem mixing a sequined thong with feminism.But where I do get confused is how the girls expect men to react to them in these overtly sexual costumes.

Children too young to remember their forebears wore their medals pinned to their chests.Their families watched them march and expressed the heartfelt hope that they would never have to repeat the sacrifices of the wartime generations. Eight-year-old Ioan Williams wore the medals of his great-grandfather Sergeant Walter Benjamin, who served in India and Burma during the Second World War.At his side, his grandmother Jane Benjamin carried a wreath for Ioan’s great-great uncle, Rifleman Walter Singer, who was killed in France just three weeks before the Armistice. Mrs Benjamin, 62, from Pontypridd in South Wales, said: ‘The veterans of the First World War aren’t here any more, so it’s up to us to make sure their legacy is passed to our children and grandchildren.‘We must never forget.

In the future, imagined some of the most progressive architects and designers of the time, homes would no longer be weighty and static. They would be portable plastic membranes that you could take to your nearest wilderness, with the help of a handy air pump, and blow up into a comfortable bubble.It never happened, partly because these concepts assumed limitless supplies of cheap energy to heat and cool the wandering shelters, an illusion that the oil crisis of 1973 abruptly ended. The bubble popped, you might say. Architectural fashion moved on to postmodernism, a style that made no claim to change the world or people’s lives, but only to entertain and comfort them. Sometimes, as with the Austrian architect Hans Hollein, who moved from inflatables to postmodern boutiques, the shift was embodied in a single person.It’s a repeating story. Designers dream of homes that are as unlike existing homes as possible – mobile, not fixed, light, not heavy, transparent, not opaque, open, not enclosed, curved, not straight – taking their inspiration from technology that moves faster than house building, such as cars, aeroplanes and spaceships. Then reality bites. The home of the future, when it arrives, turns out to be quite like the home of the past. The most significant changes – the kitchen becomes part of the living space, for example – are less glamorous than predicted. Designers then find themselves decorating the world rather than shaping it.The Home Futures exhibition at the Design Museum is a lively, illuminating, sometimes enthralling journey through a century’s-worth of aspiration and fantasy, presented in a dreamy, translucent installation by the Brooklyn-based architects SO-IL. There are the attempts of Russian architects, in the early revolutionary years, to reimagine what a home is. There are Alison and Peter Smithson, in the Ideal Home Exhibition of 1956, projecting a House of the Future in which everyone wears nylon and the dinner table (why?) rises from the floor. There is Future Systems’ House for a Helicopter Pilot of 1979, an object resembling the Apollo missions’ lunar landing module seen resting by an Alpine lake.There are a wheeled kitchen by Joe Colombo and mobile showers and lavatories by Ettore Sottsass also the protracted ruminations on the Endless House by the Austrian-American Frederick Kiesler. Never translated into reality, this was a structure without straight lines and right angles, whose curves were to respond better to human needs and emotions than conventional buildings. A persistent yearning for Arcadia emerges, for upping sticks and escaping to some techno-Walden in the forest or on a prairie. Imagine, you can hear Ono and Lennon crooning in the mind’s ear, no possessions…Sometimes breathless optimism comes tempered with doubt or irony. You can see, for example, the speculations of the Italian group Superstudio in the early 70s, that the world would be covered by a universal grid, supplied with electricity and other services, wherein modern nomads could make their home as they choose. It’s left ambiguous whether this future is considered a good thing. In the 1920s Sergei Eisenstein sketched film scenarios involving a transparent house, prompted by contemporary architects’ fascination with all-glass structures, in which the loss of privacy and possibilities for surveillance become scary rather than liberating.The show is the Design Museum’s response to the prevailing fascination with the home and with housing, but it makes no claims to find “the solution”, as the now overworked headline has it, “to the housing crisis”. The most enduring and significant exhibit, in practical terms, is Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky’s Frankfurt kitchen of 1926, captured in a grainy photograph, which pioneered the labour-saving fitted kitchen we now take for granted. Mostly, though, it is an exhibition of exotic blooms, fast-growing and fast-withering. As with most futurology, the concepts on show tell you more about the times in which they were made than about what would actually happen.But hang on. Here is the Italian Ugo La Pietra imagining in the 70s and 80s that the home would be dominated by screens. Here, in 1972, is the author Geoffrey Hoyle predicting “vision phones”, which would help you work, learn and shop from home and have food delivered straight to your fridge. This is not so far off the mark.And here, on other hand, is Amazon’s smart speaker Echo, which, as the show’s curator Eszter Steierhoffer points out, was an explicit attempt to make real the speaking starship computer in Star Trek. She also mentions that The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is Elon Musk’s “personal bible”. The future, in other words, is actually arriving, in forms that were at least partly guessed.Our lives have indeed become more transparent, and notions of privacy have changed in ways that are not entirely comfortable. What was less understood was that technology would short-circuit the physical, that it would become detached from furniture and architecture. La Pietra imagined homes with multiple screens attached to the backs and armrests of chairs, or to beds, not that they would be portable and therefore separate from the question of furniture design. The material of houses, whether see-through or opaque, is immaterial if the internet es through walls into our personal lives. Homes become transparent even if they are not made of glass.Meanwhile, a different kind of domestic future has imposed itself on the dwellers of affluent modern cities that has little to do with technology, which is the difficulty of those who do not already own a home in finding an adequate place to live. It is perfectly irrelevant to imagine a mobile shower if you don’t have the space for it to roam.What technology can and does achieve is the shrinkage of physical space by replacing it with digital space. A bookcase, a filing cabinet, a record collection become less essential if the needs they serve are met online. You have less need for food storage if you have Deliveroo, less for a garage if you have Uber.Designers of houses and physical objects cannot keep pace with digital developments, still less mimic them. In the time it takes to build a house, new and possibly life-changing apps can appear or fade. What matters is the spatial setting for the physical lives we still have, within the effects of faster technologies playing out.

Now, at 83, she talks about cruel fables and the medicinal joy of champagneThere’s a moment in old age when some people become a little girl again, and it’s at this point in her life that I meet Dame Paula Rego, the 83-year-old artist who has always been fascinated by fairytales. “There’s a traditional Portuguese folk tale where a very poor couple have run out of food.” This is her favourite. “The children are crying so the wife cuts off her breast and cooks it for supper. The next day she cuts off her other breast. But on the third day she explains to her husband that there’s nothing left to eat, and he says, ‘We’ll have to start on the children.’” She likes it because it’s “ruthless and terrible,” which are also words that have been used to describe her work, along with comical and visceral and grotesque. She sits, slowly. “I’m very, very old. But I’m an idiot. I feel very young. How old do I feel?” She thinks for a second, her eyes slightly glazed. She smiles constantly. “Eight,” she settles on, firmly.Paula Rego, who was born into a privileged family in Portugal during a dictatorship (though she was “being repressed and restrained by my mother, not Salazar”), began exhibiting with the London Group in the 1960s alongside David Hockney. She became the first associate artist at the National Gallery and today is one of our greatest living painters. Her themes are power and possession, childhood, and sexual transgression in The Policeman’s Daughter (1987), a girl polishes her absent father’s jackboot, her fist rammed in deep. She offers me some ginger tea.The light in her Camden Town studio is warm and dramatic, and falls in angles on rails of antique dresses, a stuffed octopus and a mannequin of a naked child, begging. These are props that have appeared in her paintings over the past 50 years, details in a career that has reflected a life equal parts charmed and painful. And, this is not a comfortable interview. Not because of what Rego says – she is welcoming and delightful – but because of what seems to have been lost, and recently, too.Interviewing somebody who has become very old very quickly feels both important – gather what you can before it’s too late – and exploitative, and afterwards I take the long way back to work to shake off my discomfort. Folded into her chair, she searches for the correct answers, but when they appear they’re well-worn, photocopies.Their relationship has never been easy. His sister Victoria says the children were, “very much the subplot” to Rego’s life. She kept her son at arm’s length, and “regularly excluded me because I was a man and wouldn’t get it. So to finally have her open up to me,” he says, “made me feel loved.”In 2007, during a particularly bad depression, she did a series of pictures which she locked in a drawer. They were of Lila, standing in for Rego, holding tightly on to “things that do not help”. Though they were cathartic to draw she was ashamed of them, and refused to show them for 10 years, but today her depression is as much a part of her story as the anecdote about how she met her late husband, the artist Victor Willing.She was studying at the Slade under Lucian Freud (her parents banned her from going to Chelsea School of Art when they heard about another student getting pregnant) when Vic took her into a room at a party and told her to remove her knickers. Many abortions later, when, aged 20, she decided to have a baby, he finally left his wife. Remembering Vic, she says: “Grief is always there, it doesn’t get easier. I thought about falling in love again many times, but that’s nobody’s business.”Abortion, or the promise of it, is another of Rego’s motifs. The aim of her 1998 Abortion series was to campaign for a change in Portuguese law – when they were exhibited, the gallery was full of women whispering.There is another fairytale Rego likes to tell, about a woman given a magic cake that will make her pregnant. Except, scared it is poisoned, she passes it to her husband, who gives birth to a daughter. “I like the idea of the man having the baby and his gut bursting,” Rego says. “Serves him right.”The horror of her work, unfashionable for so long due to its painterly naturalism, seems appropriate now, as truths about the female experience are being peeled back, and a return to figurative painting has seen artists use the body to discuss, among other things, the sexist politics of art.“Paula Rego’s art has come in and out of focus several times since the early 90s,” says art critic Laura Cumming. “Familiarity may have blotted out her achievements for a while. She was sometimes thought to be a kind of honorary godmother to the YBAs, but in fact her dark and knotted scenarios have almost nothing in common with their eye-popping shockery.”In her work women are strong but compliant, and they are ostriches, and they are children, scavenging for food, opening their dress to be shot. “Painting pictures is the part of you that’s a man,” Rego told her son. “It has the push, the thrust. Having babies and playing at house is… play acting. While doing a picture you are being yourself.”Every morning, Lila picks Rego up from her Hampstead home. “I live by the Heath, unfortunately,” she sniffs. “I don’t like nature. I like hotels. Trees are ever so difficult to draw – much more so than a hand.” She sips her tea. “Then we put on opera and draw until lunchtime, when I have a rest.” There is a bed built on a curtained platform near the door, overlooking the naked child and stuffed donkey. Once, visiting the studio, Charles Saatchi saw a model Rego had commissioned her son-in-law to make for her painting of Pinocchio, thus discovering Ron Mueck – the artist’s work appeared in the Sensation exhibition the following year.For all the tensions, Rego’s is a family business – on weekends, sometimes her grandchildren will sit for her. “I drew Lola as the Virgin Mary. She was 14, the age Mary was when she had Jesus – very young, isn’t it? No, they don’t know I’m a ‘great artist’. I’m Grandma.”After her rest, Lila will change the music to fado, and she will work, or try to. “But,” she groans, “I have no story right now. I’m a bit dead down there – nothing’s coming. I’m no good. It’s not always easy.” What makes it easier? “Lots of champagne.” At home, every night, she watches a film, having recently given up EastEnders. “Even a bad movie is better than no movie. I save my glass of champagne to drink while watching the film. Then I go to bed and hope not to have too many nightmares.” In 1965, she said her work was about, “giving fear a face.” As a child she was scared of everything as an adult she is scared of most things. “The devil, particularly. I saw him when I was… eight. Every Saturday at Fascist Youth they’d say: ‘Never look into a fire, you will see the face of the devil.’ And one night I heard footsteps, the door opened, and death came in. I ran into my parents’ room, but death came with me. So I remained afraid. Today, I still have bad dreams, but think less about death.” She pauses, smiling. “It’s not very nice to live inside my mind. I’d like not to have these dreams every night. I bought a dreamcatcher, but it does nothing to help. The only thing that does, is the work.” Does she ever think about retiring? “No. What would I do? Some drawing I suppose.”She walks to a chair the photographer has positioned in a vast triangle of light and closes her eyes while he focuses the lens. “Stay just like that,” he says, “perfect.” Willing, who started working with his mother when her Lisbon museum was under threat, stands to help her walk. He says old age has affected her work, but not stalled it. “She’s turning that into pictures, too. The fragility of her line, boldness of colour, directness of the image are reflections of her age, her state of mind. But while her pictures remain powerful, for me personally, I see the giant who makes them losing her strength and becoming scared.” Four clicks later the photographer tells Rego she can open her eyes, and we wait, but her eyes stay closed. There is an uneasy pause. Lila clears her throat. The photographer says it again, louder, and then again, and Rego starts awake. “Were you having a lovely dream Paula?” he smiles. “Yes?” she blinks, unsure.The Cruel Stories of Paula Rego runs until 14 January 2019 at Musée de l’Orangerie, Paris"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e61807e6d159cb0f5fb89e39795326d4287da03/17_1102_1747_1048/master/1747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2161c25b23a9b18a1ee7ac1bf7078ec3","title":"japanese kabuki prints in pictures","story":"Kabuki is a form of traditional Japanese theatre that was hugely popular from the 1600s to the 1800s. Stylised and spectacular, it featured superstar male actors whose wild expressions were often immortalised by artists such as Utagawa Kunisada (1786-1865) and then reproduced using wooden printing blocks. Tim Clark, head of the British Museum’s Japanese section, has just acquired 359 of these prints that will go on display at the museum’s Mitsubishi Corporation Japanese galleries next year. “The prints served as a memento for fans of how a particular actor interpreted a particular role,” he says. “Each design was sold at an affordable price – proverbially, ‘for a bit more than a double helping of noodles’.” For Clark, they’re an amazing glimpse into the past. “They still transmit the energy and beauty of performances from 200 years ago.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/592ce5f31a54c7a965e1e0039ac2142f618484ae/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79207d143c4042539eee03cfe62b258d","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The migrant caravan in Mexico, wildfires in California, another fatal suspected stabbing in London, protests in Gaza and the US midterms 2018 – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23643ae55cbd53d2f1f1cb69f1485f7c3630c0db/71_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=301eeaaec434748259d06dd4f7daf2da","title":"deja vu sainsburys christmas ad smacks of john lewis campaign","story":"Both feature school plays and samey straplines, but Sainsbury’s is ‘not worried’When Sainsbury’s signed up the director of the Hollywood hit The Greatest Showman to make its Christmas campaign the grocer probably thought it had the festive season all wrapped up.The only problem is the campaign, which breaks on social media and during ITV’s Coronation Street on Monday, bears an uncanny resemblance to an ad recently put out by the perennial Christmas campaign winner John Lewis.The Sainsbury’s ad, by Michael Gracey who directed the $400m-plus grossing Hugh Jackman musical, features a festive school play which seems to get off to a shaky start but goes on to be a winner with the cast performing a rendition of the New Radicals’ 1990s classic You Get What You Give. Sainsbury’s denies it is worried about similarities between its ad and a joint John Lewis and Waitrose one that ran in September. It features a school play where the cast also stun the audience by knocking out a great version of a well-known classic, in this case Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody.Laura Boothby, the head of broadcast marketing at Sainsbury’s, played down any concerns that similarities with John Lewis’ campaign, which launches its much-anticipated festive ad this week, could take the sparkle out of its Christmas ambitions.Boothby said Sainsbury’s began work on its Christmas ad in January and had not been tempted to go back to the drawing board. “When John Lewis launched they set a standard,” she said. “I wasn’t worried. It is right for Sainsbury’s, it was still the right thing for us.”The John Lewis campaign, the first joint campaign with Waitrose to promote the two retailers’ rebranding as John Lewis \u0026amp Partners and Waitrose \u0026amp Partners, uses the strapline: “When you’re part of it, you put your heart into it.” Sainsbury’s Christmas campaign has opted for: “We give all we’ve got for the ones we love.”“The school show is a flagship Christmas moment for many,” said Boothby. “The evenings spent frantically learning lines, the inventive costumes, the whole family truly plays a part. This made it the perfect setting to bring our Christmas message to life.”Sainsbury’s, which spent an estimated £7m on advertising last December, has made the ad campaign the centrepiece of a wider marketing push that includes product-led ads on TV, radio, in newspapers, digital and outdoor advertising such as billboards, posters and buses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acfef5cae55b55e743a65320317edd1a48c8b65a/0_244_5115_3068/master/5115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b2d4c3b917e45ef56029fe9e979abec","title":"the guardian view on yemens misery the west is complicit","story":"The suffering of civilians in Yemen is not only the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. It is a crime. Nobel peace laureate Tawakkol Karman says her country is being “systematically destroyed”. Half of the country’s 22 million inhabitants are on the brink of starvation 1.8 million children are severely malnourished. For many it is already too late. The United Nations predicts this could become the worst famine for a century. There were warnings of famine before the war broke out almost four years ago even then, Yemen imported almost all of its food. Conditions have since deteriorated unimaginably.The official death toll has been stuck at 10,000 for years some estimate the true tally at over five times that number. The World Health Organization warned last month that reports of cholera were running at 10,000 cases a week. The country has become a “chaos state”: a nominal entity rather than a meaningful one. A conflict that began when the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition took on Houthi rebels who had overthrown the internationally recognised president has splintered and spiralled, fuelling extremism and a southern separatist movement. These factors – and the spread of a lucrative war economy – mean peace prospects are more dire than ever. Violence has intensified since the unexpected US call for a ceasefire last month. With fighting flaring in the critical port of Hodeidah this week, the UN envoy delayed planned talks until the end of the year.The Houthis have unrealistic demands, but it isn’t surprising they want a halt to attacks on the port before they sit down. This weekend’s news that the US will cease refuelling Saudi planes looks more like an attempt to head off growing pressure. While unclassified overt support might end, secret covert US support, like that unearthed on Saturday, could increase. The administration is reportedly considering designating the Houthis a terrorist organisation. That would hardly encourage them to join talks worse, it risks increasing civilian suffering by making it harder for groups to work in Houthi-controlled areas. And starting talks, though tough in itself, will be infinitely easier than bringing them to a successful conclusion.Britain is at least inching towards a stronger stance, having finally ended its opposition to the UN security council tabling a resolution designed to put pressure on Saudi Arabia and the Houthis to end the fighting and allow aid through. The shift is welcome, and long overdue. But until we stop selling arms and sharing intelligence, we remain complicit. This is our crime too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d227ad6319e5d898469c45c8a0dbb8f68e37b9/0_128_3760_2256/master/3760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=457bdc5a15672502ad505ba0593a3eaa","title":"the lowdown on british columbia this canadian province is not to be missed","story":"With cosmopolitan cities nudging wide-open wilderness, spectacular wildlife and a superb culinary scene, British Columbia offers a host of amazing adventuresChefs around the world adore BC for its incredible produce, from sweet spot prawns, celebrated in a festival each year at Vancouver’s Fisherman’s Wharf, to the juicy Okanagan cherries and peaches, which locals devour by the crate.Start planning your trip by poring over online menus at stellar Vancouver restaurants such as chef Andrea Carlson’s Burdock \u0026amp Co Gastown go-to, French-influenced L’Abattoir or the upmarket west coast take at Botanist.

Check out kitsch memorabilia, clothing with Chinese motifs, and Hong Kong-made backpacks In the narrow, lantern-filled streets of Central and Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) – under looming mirrored skyscrapers and a hot tropical sun – Hong Kong becomes a city dedicated to eating and shopping. Visitors on a consumption high lurch from buzzing dim sum restaurants to bustling markets, gorging on truffle wontons and debating exactly how often they’d use a 10-part porcelain tea set back home. Of the hundreds of Cantonese restaurants, aromatic medicine shops and colourful boutiques stocked with local goods that line the city’s streets, the following examples in particular capture the essence of Hong Kong with aplomb.Ho Lee Fook Directly translating as “good fortune in your mouth” in English, the name of this colourful Cantonese restaurant sounds a lot like the exclamation diners make after tasting the tender roast wagyu short ribs with soy glaze, the Taiwanese chicken or the threadfin fish with Jamaican-Chinese jerk rub. The Hong Kong theme is strong throughout – think a giant shimmering bronze dragon covering one wall, while the steps leading down to the restaurant are lined with hundreds of golden toy cats raising a single paw in salute. It’s no reservations, so avoid prime time – or factor in a few strong cocktails at the bar while you wait.Jimmy’s KitchenIf only walls could talk. Jimmy’s Kitchen has been around since 1928 and has been serving western food to celebrities, politicians and particularly homesick expats for nearly a century. Today, this icon from the colonial era is packed every night with locals who come to immerse themselves in the nostalgic decor and delightfully old-fashioned attitude to food. Popular with megastars like Cary Grant and John Wayne back in the day, its menu has barely been updated since the 1950s – think steak and kidney pie and baked pork knuckle. And it is hard to imagine anywhere else in Asia where you can wallow in the past and order a steak diane, a baked alaska and white Russian for dinner.Goods of Desire With quirky bed linen, novelty stationery and posters big enough to jazz up entire rooms, Goods of Desire has been the go-to store for cool furniture and lifestyle items with a Hong Kong sense of humour since the days of the British. Launched by two architects aiming to repackage Hong Kong heritage brands into kitsch furniture, fun fashion, and quirky art for the younger generation, it has also been deliberately provocative over the years, with a number of slogans aimed at the city’s notorious Triad gangs. Today it’s beloved by tourists and the city’s legions of expats, who stock up on Hong Kong memorabilia before they head home. Try the PMQ (Police Married Quarters) branch for its tiny dim sum restaurant and potent drinks list.Vivienne TamShe designed her first womenswear collection in 1993 and over the past two and a half decades, Hong Kong-raised designer Vivienne Tam has become a household name. Today she’s the territory’s most famous fashion export, and has been credited with paving the way for Chinese designers in western fashion capitals. You’ll see why in her seven sleek emporiums that are dotted around the city. They’re filled with collections that highlight what Tam does best: interpret traditional Chinese motifs for an international audience. These include silk dresses covered in jagged mountain and swirling cloud motifs, and mesh skirts plastered in asymmetrical waterfalls.DoughnutTake the MTR at rush hour and you’ll probably have a Doughnut backpack pressed against you at some point during the journey. This hugely popular fashion accessories store was launched by two young designers in 2010. They wanted to create functional, high-quality bags that were made entirely in Hong Kong and fused fashion and functionality. Lightweight, durable and easy to use, they are ideal for big city life.

Under government regulations, fracking must stop if a 0.5-magnitude earthquake is registered.He described the system of monitoring seismicity as “highly regulated” and said the company had to “manage that risk” of causing tremors, a recording of the discussions shows.The Green party said the comments, made months before earthquakes that breached the regulatory limit, showed Cuadrilla was “obviously in way over their heads”.Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, said: “They were unaware they would cause tremors anywhere near this strong, and they evidently don’t know how to stop them.” He said he felt it was unambiguous that Lambert was referring to the 0.5 limit with his reference to “above that level”.Francis Egan, the chief executive of Cuadrilla, last week urged the government to relax the regulatory threshold or risk stifling shale gas exploration. The energy minister, Claire Perry, rejected such calls, saying only a “very foolish politician” would do so at this point.The Green party accused Cuadrilla of trying to “strong arm” the government into changing the limit.Bartley said any relaxation of the rules would be “unacceptable for residents who are concerned about the security of their homes”.Cuadrilla has been fracking daily this week but has not triggered any tremors since Sunday 4 November, when a 0.7-magnitude quake was registered. As it happened at a time when fracking was not under way, it did not register as a “red light” on the traffic light system of regulation.That has not reassured Labour and Conservative MPs in north-west England, who wrote to the business secretary, Greg Clark, last week over their concerns about the tremors.Lambert said: “Cuadrilla is operating within the traffic light system managed by the Oil and Gas Authority. The micro seismicity that has been detected at our exploration site in Preston New Road is way below anything that can be felt at surface and a very, very long way from anything that would cause damage or harm.“This is what my quote refers to. In line with regulations, seismicity will continue to be closely monitored by Cuadrilla and the relevant regulators.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afbb0c08fe394fe2e271477306577660e462e17d/0_207_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=239e2e10e9ddf49c75a61ac18a6cbadf","title":"retailers to pay up to 1bn more for recycling under waste strategy","story":"Exclusive: ministers seeking to make firms pay more towards recycling their own wasteSupermarkets, retailers and major drinks brands are set to pay tens of millions of pounds more towards recycling their used packaging under the government’s new waste strategy expected to be published this month, the  understands.Supermarkets and other major producers of packaging waste currently pay a small fraction of the cost of collecting and recycling the 11m tonnes of packaging waste produced in the UK. Ministers are considering several options to improve recycling, stop abuses to the export market in plastic packaging and make companies pay more towards collecting and recycling their own waste.Sources with knowledge of the new waste strategy, which is due to be published in a few weeks, said it contained plans to significantly increase contributions from retailers and producers from an average of about £70m a year to between £500m and £1bn a year.In 2017 local authorities spent £700m on collecting and sorting recycling, compared with £73m from major businesses including leading supermarket chains and retailers, according to the National Audit Office.There are also plans to increase the number of companies who have to contribute, from 7,002 at the moment, to include smaller producers.Any new system must take into account the EU circular economy package, which the British government has signed and which should roll over into UK law after Brexit. It requires food and drink companies and other retailers to cover the net costs of household recycling collections by local authorities, bringing the UK in line with other European countries such as Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.Abuses and corruption go largely undetected in the current system while many large companies dodge paying entirely. The structure encourages the export of plastic waste to countries where it can end up leaking into the ocean or going to landfill rather than contributing to investment in UK reprocessing.Earlier this year the  reported the plastics recycling industry was under investigation for suspected widespread abuse and fraud within the export system.Two-thirds of UK plastic packaging waste is exported rather than reprocessed in the UK, by an export market the National Audit Office has condemned as “a comfortable way for government to meet targets without facing up to the underlying recycling issues”.Since China banned the import of plastic waste, the UK has been chasing other markets in Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand, but these countries are also imposing restrictions due to the stockpiling of waste. Exports of UK plastic waste to Turkey are soaring as Britain struggles to find outlets for its packaging waste.British reprocessers have consistently called for an end to the incentive to export waste, and for investment instead to boost domestic recycling and reprocessing.Phil Conran, the chair of the advisory committee on packaging, which makes recommendations to government, said: “I think those retailers and manufacturers that are engaging in all of this do accept that costs will significantly increase. Many of them are used to much higher costs in other member states anyway, so they know it is inevitable.Nestle UK, which sits on the advisory committee on packaging, said it had been an active participant in the discussions around reforms to the current producer responsibility system.“We support any changes that will bring about a well-functioning, consistent waste collection and recycling scheme, and particularly one that will help to stimulate a circular economy for packaging within the UK,” it said in a statement.Ministers are likely to put forward up to four options to extend producer responsibility payments in the new waste strategy by the end of the year. These vary from retailers and producers directly funding local authorities’ recycling collections to a levy that would trickle down to local councils.Lee Marshall, of the local authority recycling advisory committee (Larac), said some form of direct funding was preferred. “If there is a ‘trickle down’ system, there is always the danger of how much of it in reality will trickle down to local authorities.”“We realise that, for producers in the UK, the idea of paying for the full net cost of collections is a big change. We do sympathise but we would argue that they have been getting away with it for too long,” said Marshall.A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was committed to reforming the current producer responsibility scheme.She said: “While recycling rates have increased significantly, we want to ensure producers take greater responsibility for the environmental impact of their products, starting with packaging.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ac6379764ff3c727572157a0c052338de6fa3f5/0_292_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52573c475963b570ac237032ff0c0167","title":"how we lost our love milk alt","story":"Soya, almond, oat... Whether for health issues, animal welfare or the future of the planet, ‘alt-milks’ have never been more popular. Are we approaching dairy’s final days?A couple of weeks ago, some eye-catching billboards began appearing around central and east London. Entire tunnels of the underground were plastered with the adverts the sides of large buildings were covered. On one panel there was a carton (or, in some instances, three) of Oatly, an oat drink made by a cult Swedish company that favours stark graphics, a bluey-grey colour scheme, and which is a market leader – in a not uncompetitive field – in the tongue-in-cheek promotional messages known as “wackaging”. The adjacent panel, in large, wobbly type, read: “It’s like milk, but made for humans.”Around the same time, during commercial breaks on Channel 4’s 4oD, there appeared a 15-second clip of a man in a field of oats, playing a tinny 1980s synthesiser and howling: “Wow, no cow!” That guy is Toni Petersson, the 50-year-old CEO of Oatly, and the song, you would not be entirely surprised to learn, is his own composition. “Listen, it’s absolutely terrible, right?” says Petersson, over the phone from Eugene, Oregon. “My creative directors wanted to make some commercials that I was part of. One of them included a song that they wrote, which was even worse. I had no idea I thought it was going to be shown one time only.”Petersson, who previously worked in nightclubs and Costa Rican real estate, became Oatly CEO in 2012. So is he fearful of – or even hoping for – a similar battle in the UK now? “There might be some legal consequences, I don’t know,” he replies. “But am I concerned about it? No, I’m not. It’s just true!” Petersson laughs. “We actually have really, really good lawyers they really enjoy this too. I mean, who could argue with the fact: ‘It’s like milk, but made for humans?’ How can that be wrong?”Then there are people who have never much liked drinking milk, or who don’t buy the health claims that resolutely cling to it. Or maybe they just want to try something different. Oat drinks, which tend to taste quite neutral but still creamy, can often be a gateway for those thinking of converting. Oatly, in particular, dominates the market of specialist coffee shops, especially in Europe and the US. This summer, the New Yorker reported that New York was experiencing a critical shortage of Oatly, which began supplying a handful of coffee shops in the city in 2016 but expanded rapidly to more than 1,000 outlets nationwide. A litre of Oatly was selling for $20, five times the regular price.I suggest to Petersson that this might have been another publicity stunt: creating scarcity and fanning interest. “Oh, I wish it was,” he says. “I wish we were that clever.”Beyond oats, the options are almost overwhelming. Rude Health, Britain’s leading organic, dairy alternative brand, began selling drinks in 2013: it started with oat, brown rice and – almost as an afterthought – almond. This turned out to be a sound move Rude Health’s Almond Drink is its bestselling item in any category and it is estimated that two-thirds of the alt-milk sold in Britain is almond (one of the main drivers, apparently, was Gwyneth Paltrow, who extols its virtues in her recipes and on her wellbeing site Goop). Rude Health now makes 10 drinks, including exotic offerings such as hazelnut and calcao, and tiger nut, which is not actually a nut, but a tuber.Meanwhile, Innocent – the birthplace of “wackaging” (infantilised, overfamiliar packaging), and since 2013, owned by Coca-Cola – moved into dairy-free drinks earlier this year (its slogan: “You ain’t seen nuttin’ yet”). It has a range of four – almond, oat, hazelnut and coconut – and makes much of the fact that its almond and oat drinks only contain the named ingredient plus spring water and salt.Likewise, whereas once you might, if you were lucky, have found soya in a vegan-friendly cafe, now alt-milk has gone mainstream. Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee chain, has not failed to take note of the trends coming out of the smaller, third-wave coffee shops, where idiosyncratic requests are a point of pride for both customer and barista. It is rapidly supplementing its plant-based menu and now offers coconut, oat, almond and soya “milk”. It’s hard to measure the impact of Instagram – specifically “latte porn” – but everyone agrees it has been influential in spreading the word, especially with a younger crowd.Traditional, regular milk, probably derived from a cow, faces quite a battle then. But this is nothing new. Mark Kurlansky, who has previously written books on cod and salt, calls milk “the most argued-over food in human history”. There have been – and remain – impassioned debates over, among others, the benefits of breastfeeding, which animals we should and should not milk, the safety of “raw” milk, the health benefits of pasteurised. Many of these have been taking place for many thousands of years.“If you think about it, it’s not surprising people argue over it,” Kurlansky tells me. “What is it? It’s bodily fluid that mothers produce for their young. I’d have loved to have been there the first time there was this baby and either the mother had died or the mother wasn’t able to produce milk and they are all standing around saying, ‘What are we going to do? We’ve got to get milk for the baby.’ And somebody says, ‘What about that goat over there?’ I mean, what an extraordinary moment!”Bryans has seen Oatly’s new advertising campaign and, unsurprisingly, she’s not impressed. “What is fascinating, to me, is that plant-based drinks market themselves on dairy values,” she says. “If your product is really strong as a product in its own right, why do you need to market yourself on the basis of the virtues of another product that already exists? In terms of the idea about ‘milk, but made for humans’, I have a PhD in nutrition and people have been consuming milk and dairy products for millennia. They’ve been consuming them for a variety of reasons: for nutrition, for their versatility, for the taste, for the benefits they give.”Kurlansky, too, doesn’t entirely buy Oatly’s line. “Yeah, but who says humans are supposed to drink oats?” he says. “Now,” she adds, “you turn around the carton of that plant-based beverage and what you tend to have is a very small percentage of the plant, and then you have colourings, preservatives, additives, and usually fortification of vitamins and minerals that already exist naturally in milk.”For these reasons, Bryans thinks that alt-milks (which typically cost between £2 and £3.50 per litre) will be exactly what Oatly’s Petersson insists they are not: a fad. “You grow up with milk in your childhood, it’s your friend, when you’re expecting your own child, all through your adult life and into old age,” she says. “Alternative products are the trendy friend you go clubbing with but you break up with them really often. So you might flirt with one kind of plant-based drink, then another kind, but milk is the one that sticks with you throughout your life.”Part of the reason for this shift, unquestionably, is that many of us have lost faith that drinking milk is doing us good. Milk does contain calcium and vitamin D, but whether this leads to stronger bones, as our parents assured us, is controversial and contested by some recent studies. It’s packed with protein, which is essential for the growth and repair of the body, but in the UK, most people already consume more protein than they need.“There’s all these myths about milk being healthy,” says Kurlansky. “A lot of it isn’t true and a lot of people have been drinking milk, and not particularly liking it, because they thought that they should. And so now they realise they don’t have to and they are glad not to.”When I meet Nick and Camilla Barnard, the founders of Rude Health, at their HQ in west London, I expect them to talk down milk. Instead, strangely, they have something close to sympathy for it. And actually, they really like it – at least in its raw, unpasteurised form. Nick Barnard even reminisces fondly of winning the World Porridge-Making Championships in 2013, using raw Guernsey milk and cream from a dairy in Somerset that he had to “smuggle” into Scotland, because they are outlawed there.“Milk is an extraordinary, incredibly complex substance, but we’ve reduced it to red, blue or green,” says Camilla Barnard. “And the supermarkets fight over how low in price it can be. We’ve just pasteurised it, we’ve homogenised it, we’ve made it as cheap as possible – bang it out there. And then, surprise, surprise, we’ve gone off it. We lost all the value in it, which is really sad.”The Barnards believe alt-milks are thriving because they offer something different. “We just felt consumers were ill-served by choice,” says Nick Barnard. “So we came in with a pizzazz, we came in saying, ‘This tastes great! You can bake with it! You can make smoothies! You can make horchata!’ So all of a sudden, it was just more joyful. It’s not misery: ‘I can’t have milk.’ If you like almond, then have almond if you like gold top, and you’re not lactose intolerant, then have that. Celebrate ersity.”He agrees with the dairy lobby that it doesn’t make sense to directly compare milk and plant-based drinks. “At the end of the day, almonds and water have the nutritional value of almonds and water. The value of raw milk is that it’s a food” – that is, nourishing and sustaining on a deeper level. “Our work is to not encourage anxiety: ‘You must have this dairy-free, because dairy is going kill you!’ Or: ‘Cows are going to destroy the world.’ No! What you need to do is to say: ‘What suits me?’ And then: ‘Does it make me feel good?’”David and Wilma Finlay are dairy farmers with a medium-sized holding in Dumfries and Galloway, not far from the English border. They run the Ethical Dairy and are trying a new approach to cow’s milk. They have “110-ish” cows that are hybrids of three breeds designed to create a more robust, productive and long-living animal. “Our cows look like liquorice allsorts – they are all kinds of colours and shapes and sizes,” explains David Finlay. “There’s a lot of bonuses that come from crossing, but they don’t look so pretty.”For much of the past 25 years, the Finlays have been turning the milk from their cows into ice-cream, but they recently began to concentrate on making artisan, raw-milk cheese. But that’s not what is really radical about what they are doing. A couple of years ago, the Finlays started to wonder if they could make their farm work both as a business and an ethical enterprise that puts animal welfare at the heart of the operation. At the centre of the experiment was the idea to allow calves to stay with their mothers for five to six months after they are born. The cows are still milked during this period, but only once a day.Some background might be helpful. In most commercial dairies, calves are taken away from their mothers soon after birth organic farms are required to keep them together for a minimum of 24 hours. On the most intensive dairies, cows will be milked three times a day. In these industrial facilities many cows don’t survive to the age of five.The Finlays’ experiment began in October 2016 and David admits the first year did not go well. The farm was “haemorrhaging” money and the cows were discombobulated. “We were all stressed about when were they going to see the calves again,” he explains. “Every time we came into the parlour: were the calves going to be there? They didn’t know what the rules were any more. The rules had changed.”Finlay was ready to give up but his staff talked him round. He’s pleased they did: year two has just come to an end, the milk yield is back up and the cows are thriving. “OK, we’re still not profitable,” he says, “but we’re on our way to a profitable system.” One of the benefits of a less intensive system is there is much less pressure on the cows, so they in theory live longer. There’s evidence of this already on the Finlays’ farm, which converted to organic around 20 years ago: their oldest milking cow is nearly 18, and the average is around nine. Also, in recent years the Finlays have reduced the farm’s greenhouse-gas emissions by more than half, one of the least defensible aspects of dairy farming.Moreover, the public seems to like what the Ethical Dairy is doing. The Finlays recently launched a crowd-funding campaign to raise £50,000 with an aim to “revolutionise the dairy industry”: their hope was to share what they’ve learned and make ethical farming open source. They achieved their target with days to spare. “We listened to our customers and said, ‘OK, we’re going to give it a go, will you come with us?’” says David Finlay. “Because no one else in the industry is going to help, no one in government is going to help us. And it really is quite amazing how that has reverberated.”Is there a model here for the future of dairy farming? Would customers – even the younger generation – return to milk if they had a guarantee that everything had been done to make its production as ethical, sustainable and environmentally considerate as possible? That all efforts have been taken to make the end product as delicious as it can be? It’s difficult to predict if this could work on any scale: a few farms in the UK have a similar system to the Ethical Dairy, but it is by far the largest. And there is another problem: price. It’s often pointed out that milk now costs less than a bottle of water. Decades of industrialisation and commodification means that it’s hard to imagine supermarkets suddenly telling us that a pint of milk is now actually £2.Even David Finlay does not think that price rises are the answer. “It’s a very difficult one. People say, ‘Well, we’d be happy to pay 10p a litre more – that’s not a big issue for us.’ But you think, if the farmer was getting 10p a litre more, I know what would happen. My neighbour who has got 1,500 dairy cows, he’d put up a shed tomorrow with 500 more cows in it. Whereas your 100-cow guy couldn’t afford to put up a new diary premises for more cows. OK, he would benefit but almost immediately there would be too much milk in the market and the price would come down. So the price is only one factor in the whole food cycle.”More likely, in the future, we will see a more extreme version of what we have now. “With milk, as with almost all food, two separate markets are developing: rich, urban people and everybody else,” says Kurlansky. “It was actually a Welsh farmer who said to me, ‘The future of high-quality milk is in cities.’”Suddenly what you splash on your cereal in the morning or dash in your coffee has become very complicated. Regular milk is too commodified alt-milk is not nutritious enough raw milk, to use an often-quoted line, is like “playing Russian roulette” with your health. But, as with many aspects of modern life, the outlook is not relentlessly gloomy. Never have there been more options to choose from. If you want to find a dairy committed to ethical practices, they are out there. If you want to use M*lk, made from a “nut” (but really water flavoured with an edible tuber), that exists too. And if you’re happy to ignore the incongruity of pouring another animal’s milk in your tea, then the shops will still stock your blue, green and red for a while yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/435449d62d519e79dbceb7fcfcb2e224672a328b/152_0_4888_2933/master/4888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b107acae42d5d01fe2f895ef1f6b0e4","title":"jose mourinho defends manchester united claims outplayed","story":"• ‘The game was open for 80-something minutes’• Sterling ticked off by Guardiola after City’s 3-1 winJosé Mourinho reached deep into his book of excuses after Manchester United were outplayed in the derby to fall 12 points behind the Premier League leaders.To almost every observer at the Etihad Stadium, the game was controlled by City but the Manchester United manager saw things differently. Although his side’s only shot on target was the second-half penalty Anthony Martial scored in response to goals from David Silva and Sergio Agüero, he denied the 3-1 scoreline reflected the game.“If the third goal is scored in one of the moments where they were dominating I would probably say so but it comes in a moment where we were in the fight to get the equaliser,” he said. Mourinho insisted United had given “not a negative performance at all” and added: “If you focus on the game today, it was open for 80-something minutes.”United’s manager suggested recent matches at Bournemouth and Juventus had done his players no favours when City had faced Southampton and Shakhtar Donetsk at home.“The game,” he said, “was open in a week when they play three home games and have 6-1, 6-0 victories, relaxed, everything nice and easy and we play two matches away, difficult where the second was like a final against one of the best teams in Europe where we give everything physically, mentally.”Raheem Sterling’s stepovers in the final seconds drew an angry reaction from Juan Mata, who appeared to accuse the forward of showboating, and Pep Guardiola confronted the England international at the end over his behaviour. “He made some movements with the legs, we can avoid it, but he’s young and he’s going to improve,” City’s manager said.Guardiola was not entirely satisfied with the performance of his team, whose third goal came from Ilkay Gündogan. “First half not so good,” he said. “We played like: ‘I don’t want to lose the ball’ but not the intention to attack or to do something. I feel when I watch my players, a team that feel a little bit the pressure. They want to do well in the derby. That’s normal.“Despite that, we were stable, we score one goal, the first 15 minutes was so good and after that we didn’t press so well. They could play more than usual but the second half we start from the beginning much, much better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb6cc3544c26c2948a0251b1a60c44cf6e92fc6a/0_88_1396_837/master/1396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03f25a2a15af12b022f14fb7a2d8ea31","title":"manchester city david silva sergio aguero manchester united","story":"Manchester City’s golden pair of old lags proved the dominant forces as the champions ran rings around Manchester UnitedOn an afternoon of cold, imperious dominance at the Etihad Stadium, two things stood out. First Manchester City produced passages of football that were utterly breathtaking, so beautifully engineered in their movement and passing that at times the result felt like an inevitability.And second David Silva and Sergio Agüero, the two most bizarrely gong-free superstars in the Premier League, were once again the dominant forces. It is an unarguable truth of this City project. For all the hundreds of millions spent, the renovation of every surface, the best trick City ever pulled was signing Silva and Agüero eight and seven years ago respectively.Silva it was who scored the opening goal with 12 minutes gone at an agreeably boisterous stadium. It was a moment that brought together both of these elements: the purity of City’s football and the enduring brilliance of their old lags.In those early exchanges City hadn’t so much taken charge of this game as picked it up by the elbows and carried it off out of the door, feet barely touching the ground. The sky blue blitz has been a key weapon this season. Time and again City have come surging out at the first whistle like a freak wave hurtling up the beach, crushing every sandcastle in its path.Before this afternoon Pep Guardiola’s team had scored eight times in the first 14 minutes. Silva made it nine at the end of a passage of play that was close to a kind of perfection, during which City’s opponents were effectively reduced to the status of a plot device, a piece of exposition around the edges.The goal came from a classic Guardiola move, the ball fizzed at thrilling speed from left to right, Silva finding Raheem Sterling, whose cross was pinged back towards Silva, whose shot was ked hard into the back of the net off David de Gea’s hand.It felt fitting that Silva should be the scorer, and indeed that Agüero should get the second in a Manchester derby that marked 10 years to the month since the first of these games in the Theatre of Dirhams era.By the time he left the pitch, to so many handshakes you half expected United’s players to start joining in, Silva had once again played like the only grownup on the pitch. When United pressed, as they did to their credit, it was Silva who began to take the ball and keep it, passing simply, taking the tempo down a notch.United did play well in patches. José Mourinho’s starting midfield trio of Matic-Herrera-Fellaini was a fascinating prospect, a collection of medieval siege towers wheeled out on to the Etihad Stadium pitch to confront City’s elf army. With Pogba absent Mourinho had little choice but to just hang it all and go full José, to line up those Easter Island heads and try to squeeze the game as hard as possible.City’s early goal was followed by a period of stasis. Marcus Rashford was lively for 10 minutes. The game entered a drowsy, somnolent period, too early for United to start gearing up their final barrage, too early for City to commit in search of more. John Stones was outstanding in central defence, all elegant, long-striding certainty. And it was Agüero who made it 2-0 in another of those periods of high‑speed blitz football at the start of the second half. Bernardo Silva won the ball in midfield. Riyad Mahrez played his best pass of the game, a lovely little indolent return pass to Agüero that invited him to k the ball into the top corner with thrilling power, the finish of a genuine artist.Such are Guardiola’s attacking riches he could afford to rest the Premier League’s best centre‑forward on Wednesday night. And here he was back again, hair bleached a spectacular lemon sorbet rinse, looking refreshed and mobile and ready to apply that thrilling razor edge, the veering runs, the sniper’s eye in shifting the ball and rippling the corners. The Etihad Stadium really is Agüero’s sunlit stage: he now has 18 goals and five assists in his past 14 Premier League games here, tribute to a player whose game has evolved and found deeper gears under Guardiola. Quite how he keeps on managing not to get in the Premier League’s team of the season remains an oddity, 151 goals into his time here.United pulled one back, deservedly, through Anthony Martial from the spot. But City always seemed likely to score a third. That they did at the end of a move that took in 44 passes and involved an exhausted defensive mistake right at the end, allowing Ilkay Gündogan to score, was also unsurprising.There have been more ruthless derby victories than this, but few surely as coldly executed as this, with the sense of one team simply exploring its range and driven on as ever by the peerless David Silva, still the best decision anyone on the bridge of this annihilating sky blue super tanker ever made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37d9931b3b748d9ad20577b7b1ba01ce3e83a728/0_0_2603_1697/master/2603.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9669e288696700aafc343ea2f51730de 720w","title":"into the dark meet the people who have to work through the night","story":"Increasingly, we live in a 24-hour world. Florists, midwives, bakers and others throw some light on the challenges of going nocturnalWhen I was younger, I was always that kid half-asleep in school because I’d been awake the night before unable to sleep. It makes sense that now I pretty much start work when everyone is bedding in for the evening. I think it’s when my creativity kicks in, when I want to socialise. When I wake up I don’t want people to look me in the face – but when night comes that doesn’t matter, because I’ve made a new one: the makeup is on, I’ve made a hat and done my nails. I can go and face the world.I’m part of the furniture at Savage – the gay disco I run at an East End strip club on a Saturday night. It means I can run in last minute from another gig, throw my bags down and get to work. I’m usually working the door, which means standing on the street until 4am come rain or shine. I never factored that into my drag career – the number of coats I’d need to buy to make sure I look fabulous when it’s -5C.A drink or two, well, or seven, helps me make it through the night. Alcohol is a lube that makes working the night run smoothly. That said, I do a regular sweep of the club as it gets busier and have a quiet word with anyone who’s looking too wasted. “Have a bottle of water, babe,” I’ll tell them, while pointing in the direction of the toilets so they can sort themselves out.Our venue is a strip club through the week, so there’ll be guys who turn up and don’t know there’s a gay disco in. We tell unknowing punters that there’s a private party and point them down the road.I clock off at 4am, so I get to enjoy the final hour of the party. Even if I’m exhausted, I’ll stay for a dance and to take in what we’ve created. The bouncers all finish at 5am sharp, but that’s also kicking out time. We spit 150 people out on to the street, and they can be vulnerable. I don’t mind staying a little longer, making sure everyone is hydrated and makes it home OK. I’ll never forget that time that I was beaten up on a night out.By the time the night is over, I can’t wait to be outside – especially in the summer when dawn is breaking. I jump on my bike and cycle along the deserted canals in all my regalia. I love the feeling of taking my heels and lashes off at the end of the night. You learn early on that drag is uncomfortable – whether that’s staying awake all night working, or itchy wigs and scratchy face. It’s gritty and sweaty, and it ends up smudged all over your pillow. But you also learn to be poised, and to work through it. To dance it off, or just hide in the toilet while you regain your composure. I used to feel out of place in nightclubs, like a misfit. In drag I’m the outrageous colour at the party, the caretaker of the club.I started out at the market when I was four years old. Both my dad and my uncle Mick were in the business, so I’d go and help. By 14 I’d left school. My dad explained to the headmaster I’d be better off working. And he was right. Even now I don’t feel like I go to work, I go on holiday every day and I enjoy it. When you work nights you have no life, so the market becomes it. You don’t do it for the money. You’ve got no time to spend what you earn anyway. I’m at work when everyone else is down at the pub.The first thing I do when I wake up, around 1am, is have a black coffee. You never get used to getting up so early. Then I head to the market. We unload, get the orders sorted, put out the flowers nice and orderly so they look effective to the eye.Our first customers come in about 3am – florists, event organisers, hotel porters. There’s less bartering than there used to be, although we are a market, so you can always try it. But you don’t necessarily have to go cheap for people to buy from you, it’s about being on their wavelength and approachable. It’s like if there’s a nice barman at a pub who you get on with, you become a local.I live on between two and four hours sleep a day, I’ve been that way since I was a kid. I’m fortunate. My dad is the same, we just don’t need it. My working day is over by midday, so there was always time to spend with the family. That’s more important to me – I’ll get all the sleep I want when I’m dead.When you work at the market, you help each other out. If I run out of a particular flower or something I’ll go and get some from someone else for a reasonable price so I can still make a profit. It works because I do the same for them. By 11am we’re finished, so then it’s into the van for an hour to deliver orders. Traffic and the congestion charge means not everyone can make it down to Vauxhall. Then I’m off to the golf course.People thought we were mad, opening a bakery in Yorkshire, in the height of Thatcher’s Britain, when we first arrived in Otley in 1983. Independent businesses were closing down at a rate of knots. God bless Paul Hollywood, but back then the craft of proper baking wasn’t as popular as it is now. My partner Steve and I fitted the place ourselves. We were working on a shoestring, which meant we’d sell through the day and bake through the night. The secret? Well, 35 years later he’s still making me laugh.When you’re younger, you can do the nights pretty easily. We went to a friend’s 21st birthday party and stayed well into the early hours of the morning before heading back to crack on with the baking – I’ll never forget the sight of Steve falling asleep on the step by the ovens with the loaves still inside. It was quite romantic in those days, being holed up in the kitchen – and occasionally dancing. We built a business together while we built a life. Now we’ve got a team, so our shift patterns vary and it’s a little more professional. But it’s all hands on deck come 8pm on a Friday.I adore working through the early hours, it’s almost magical. Inside the bakery it’s hot and a hive of activity – music blaring from the radio as we fill the shelves with treats which bring the shop to life. But step outside into the darkness for a moment and it’s serene and silent. In the winter, taking in the icy air and the moonlight can reinvigorate you better than coffee ever can. We’ll always keep the door open if it’s snowing.In the summer, the birds are there to keep you company as the light starts to trickle over the Chevin. We’ll pop outside together – whoever is working – to look at the sky, as picturesque and tranquil as they seem in Turner’s paintings. The aroma of fresh-baked bread mixed with the morning air makes for a heady cocktail.There’s always a lull – it hits you at about three in the morning – but we turn the music up a little louder, have a singalong, and then carry on. If I can, though, I’ll head out to do some deliveries in the early hours of Saturday morning. It means I get to drive through the beautiful countryside before anyone else. Of course, if I’m in the van, I’ve got to stick to a schedule. But at the top of the Chevin I’ve been known to pull into a pub car park and take in dawn in all its splendour for a moment. You feel like you own the earth – and it’s wonderful. Not for too long, though, the bread needs to be delivered. And the bakery needs to be open again by 7am.After 30 years as a midwife, I’ve pretty much seen it all. One day you’re part of the happiest night of somebody’s life, the next you’re there to support them through tragedy. Ups and downs are part of the course, as is working 247.In a unit like ours, the lights are on day or night, you sometimes don’t even notice the difference. I suppose there are less managers, matrons and office staff around, but our job stays exactly the same. It means our tight-knit night team is totally patient-focused. We’re a sociable unit – we try to eat together when we can. If we’re being good, we might have a salad night, and occasionally we’ll order pizzas. Otherwise everyone brings different bits in and, when we can, we share. It’s awful for the waistline, but great for the soul. Nights can be long and hard, so spending time together is good for morale.The secret to making it through the night is sleeping between shifts. There’s nothing worse than being exhausted but needing to be awake and alert at three in the morning. You can’t falter: you’re responsible for the lives of women and their babies. I’m lucky, I’m a good sleeper at whatever time. I used to get out of bed for the kids. But mine are grown up now, so I can indulge myself. Although at night if I wake up for a wee, I can go back to sleep. In the daytime that can be a little harder.Sometimes it’s difficult to sleep if something upsetting has happened the night before. The warm fuzzy feeling you get from delivering a healthy baby is comforting, but there are scary nights, when something happens to a baby. You learn to switch off, but however long you do the job it can still get to you. Babies are robust creatures. It’s amazing what they can cope with, even if they need a little bit of help. They’re tougher than you might imagine.I never set out to be a midwife, but I’ve loved my time in the job. Helping bring life into the world, especially when outside the ward everyone is sleeping, gives you a buzz. And the excitement is that for 12 hours at a time anyone could walk in through the door, ready to start that journey. Even tiredness can be staved off when a baby is being born.You can get a call at anytime from the transplant coordinator. From then you have an hour to be at the hospital and ready to go. That is why I live close by. I do not have the luxury of time to travel or prepare when the phone rings. I’ll have already worked a full day in the operating theatre, so if you’re on call at night – as I am twice a week – I get to sleep after I finish a day shift as soon as I can. Sometimes I would not be able to get home. If something comes up at the end of the day I might be working close to 24 hours at a time. Everything is already prepared. We’ll get our kit together during the day and sort out the trolley.Two teams get called in at night, and I can be on either. One retrieves the liver for transplantation from deceased donors, the other will do the implantation operation when the organ arrives. It’s not a heart-warming operation to undertake, collecting an organ. But we know that it’s going to give someone else another shot at life. Generally we’ll take an ambulance and drive through the city, flashing lights on if necessary. But if other teams are busy we could end up travelling to other cities, or even abroad.People in the health service work incredibly hard, especially at night, but at times you cannot help but feel exhausted. You’ve got to stay awake and stay alert, so we try to nap whenever it’s possible. We look out for each other, work together and support each other. When you’re working a night, a patient may well never see you before you operate on them. I’ll see people recovering across the hospital who I’ve cared for who’ll never even know who I am. Sometimes a partner or a loved one will point us out and say: “Him! That’s the guy!”When I finally start to head home, I’m exhausted. I’ll sit in the ambulance and stare out the window watching the city pass by as I try to wind down. It’s a comfort to think people from all corners of the world are working through the night in our NHS. Teams of people in wards, determined to do all they can to save lives.When I come to work at 5.30pm, I spend an hour “reading in” – that’s radio-talk for taking in the stories from across the globe. Then we start putting the show together: we’re live until 5am, so even with pre-prepared parts, we have up to three hours to fill when we go live at 1am. As a journalist, it can be tough – the offices are basically empty at night. But that’s also a thrill and, being the BBC, people know who we are and trust us. It gives us extraordinary access into people’s lives.Take the night of the Manchester attack – I spoke to people who couldn’t find their friends, to eye witnesses and experts. We had to work out what to say – we can’t just spread rumours. At 3am the fire, police and ambulance departments all released information to say 19 were dead. That was a horrible moment. There’s a pause, and then you carry on. There’s a secret gear in the gearbox you tap into when you’re doing breaking news through the night. Nothing quite hits you at the time, it can’t if you’re going to do your job. But, of course, once the news stopped rolling and the adrenaline subsided, I just wanted to cry.I struggle to keep myself awake sometimes. I’ve never fallen asleep at the desk, but I’ve come close. Walking around the deserted office helps, as does sugar. Lots of sugar. I have been known to scour the empty desks for leftover packets of Haribo. We all have different theories on how best to make it through: mine is eating your last meal at 10pm – a giant bowl of pasta. You just don’t want to eat after that. Coffee is good, but at that time it tastes disgusting. That’s the hard thing about working nights, everything feels gross. By 3am you just feel grubby.We finish around half-five in the morning. I drive home in silence, and get into bed fully dressed. It doesn’t take long to switch off. By about 7.45am, my husband will send in one of the kids to wake me up. I have half an hour to drink a coffee, clean my teeth and get ready for the school run, still in last night’s clothes and make-up. I get them to school, come home, and then I don’t touch TV or anything. I’ll get into my PJs and go back to bed.Having someone live overnight is important. For all the podcasts and pre-records, there’s something irreplaceable about a real-life person coming out of a box in your house or your car. Our listeners depend on us. We know who’s listening: milkmen, posties, factory workers, lorry drivers. Some are struggling to sleep in the midst of depression. When I became a mum at 24, I was the first of my friends to have a child. Radio kept me sane on those lonely nights up feeding. We’re all leading more insular lives. If you’re isolated, on your own, or can’t leave the house for whatever reason, you can turn us on. We’re there for you – to keep you company while you’re awake, safe in the knowledge that whatever happens we’ll still be there.When I started out as a tea boy in the industry, we didn’t work as many nights. But as the country has begun to operate on a 24-hour basis, we’re drafted in to work on tight schedules after dark, to make sure what we do causes minimal disruption. I’m now the supervisor for resurfacing works: setting up jobs, checking quality to make sure specifications are as required. If it’s fixing the surface we’ll re-lay it, if it’s new we build from the foundations up. As a minimum we’ll have a low loader bringing in machinery, a paver, a roller and a JCB. Then there’s a sweeper, the muck-away trucks and a spray tanker. It makes for quite a convoy – but we need it all to keep the roads and runways safe.I’ve got four young kids and working nights means I get to spend a lot of time with them. I might miss them in the morning, but after school I’m around the house. I wouldn’t be if I was working days contesting with rush-hour traffic.If I’ve got to bed by 5am, I’ll be awake again by 11ish. I’ll check some emails, see what’s planned for later, and then head to the gym or sort out the house. A lot of my work is now at Heathrow, so I’ll be on site by about 10pm to get our team briefed for the night ahead. Once the final plane has left the runway we come out of the shadows and get to work. Whatever time we get started – and there are often delays – we have to be clear by the time the first flight is due to land at 4.45am.You get to see behind the scenes when you’re on nights: airports are a hive of activity once the runways are shut. It’s the same on the motorways. I work the M40 because it’s not far from our house. Sure, it’s a little quieter, but the world keeps on going with drivers heading to and fro from dusk until dawn. It’s hard to put my finger on it, but there’s definitely a different ambience when you work through the night. We enjoy what we do and everyone’s more focused. Maybe it’s because there are fewer distractions and there’s little wriggle room in our timings. Or it might just be the promise of getting into bed when it’s all done.If you’re working 12-hour shifts, four nights on and four nights off, you need to look after your mind and your body. When I arrive at Brown’s Hotel to start at 8pm it’s the busiest time for me: guests want tables that night at restaurants that get booked up weeks in advance and to be on the list at London’s most exclusive clubs. We provide a 24-hour concierge service, and we get requests you couldn’t even imagine. Our job is to always say yes – as long as it’s legal – even if something seems impossible.By 1am things tend to be a little quieter. At home before a shift I’ll make a meal and split it in half. Once the evening rush fades away I’ll eat my first meal. I’ll eat the other half before we get busy again, usually just before 5am. Diet is important – I eat healthily, lots of protein. I don’t drink coffee, so it’s nutrition that keeps me awake and focused through the night.After dark, it can be a challenge to provide everything our guests might wish for. But you build a network of contacts in the city and in concierge teams across the world. A couple of weeks back a member of a Middle Eastern royal family wanted Krispy Kreme donuts at 5am – long before any shop was open. The other day we were tasked with arranging a helicopter in a call that came in after midnight to pick up our guests at 7am. Then there was the time we were asked to bring a guest’s wildcat into the UK without separating it from its owner. We were faced with the legal requirement of it having to be kept in a “zoo environment” so we went ahead and had one built on his private estate.There’s no secret trick to the job. If you’re nice to people, to everyone you meet, everything becomes so much easier. My contact book is a manual, a guide to the city at night.I grew up on a council estate in Islington. The culture here was something of a shock at first. But serving in the army prepared me well for the job: never say no, present yourself immaculately, and high standards even in challenging circumstances are a must. To join the Golden Keys Society – an international network of concierges – you quite literally need to serve your time to earn your stripes.And then we finish at 8am – and it’s rush hour in the capital. It’s quite a nice feeling, getting into bed when everyone is going to work. You can tell who else has worked the night – everyone has their head down. You experiment in search of the easiest way home. It’s not just the fastest, but the quietest – where will you get a seat? I’m always tweaking the route. Anyone getting off the train with you at the end of the line has done a night shift as well. There’s a solidarity there amongst the group of zombies.Every call starts the same: “Hello, Samaritans, can I help?” From there anything can happen. You have to clear your mind, be in a positive headspace when you’re on shift. I’ve got a ritual for it now. My friend, who I volunteer with, picks me up in her car around 10pm – we have a happy playlist which we sing along to on the way in. At half-10 when we take over, we’ve already made a pot of tea, and sorted a tray of biscuits. Then we turn the phones on. From that point on it doesn’t stop. I was surprised at first at how busy we are. There’s so many people in so much despair, but I’m just glad they’re trying to reach out and talk to us.Callers talk about loneliness, depression, suicide, grief. It could be anything really. We don’t give advice, we just encourage people to open up – and then we listen. I don’t think most people realise how much that helps. Everyone is anonymous, sometimes they’ll tell me their name, but often they won’t. Either way I’ll never know who they are, or speak with them again. That can be the hardest part, especially after a really emotional conversation. It’s the best thing for it, though. I always just assume the best happened, you can’t let yourself think about the alternative. But it’s sometimes hard not to wonder what happened to them next.What strikes me sometimes is just how together someone’s life might sound on the surface: a caller might talk about their family, their friends, their job and their security – but in their mind there’s no light and nothing to live for. Anyone they might otherwise turn to is asleep – when you’re alone with nowhere to turn you can just keep on falling. That’s why we’re there every hour of every day.Doing the phones at night can make you feel quite isolated. There’s no hustle and bustle, nobody driving past the windows or chatting outside. When a call ends, I check in on my shift partner and we’ll have a cuppa.At the end we drive home in silence. We give ourselves space to wind down. You’ve been dealing with other people’s lives for hours – just minutes ago it almost felt like daytime. Now it’s pitch black and you’re all alone. When I get into bed I cuddle my partner. It can take a while – even when it’s so late – to actually fall asleep.I never called the Samaritans before I became a volunteer, but I know friends who did. Since starting, I’ve called in myself when I’ve been struggling. Having experienced the same feelings as callers is almost a superpower when you’re a Samaritan. People can hear in my voice that I really do understand them, and it reminds me that it’s normal to feel overwhelmed. In a weird way it’s like I’ve got relationships with people all over the country, but I’ll never know them and they’ll never know me. It also changes you. I ask people how they are at university, or when I’m on shift at Tesco. You learn the importance of checking people are OK.

A century after that terrible conflict’s end, I wonder if the authority of the timetable is going to work its mischief once again. Though Brexit can scarcely be compared to a great global conflict, it is increasingly obvious that – whatever form it takes – it will be worse than the status quo.Only the most flame-eyed ideologues seriously believe otherwise: the kind who would have declared the sighting of the iceberg from the Titanic to be Project Fear. Regrettably, a great many others in the political class have succumbed to wilful blindness, choosing the craven option of quiet complicity, rather than the harder path that a public recognition of reality would entail.They claim only to be enacting the “will of the people”, expressed in the 2016 referendum, as though they have no corollary responsibility to respond as representatives of their constituents to all that has emerged in the past two and a half years about the likely form and consequences of Brexit.The whole ridiculous process is now governed by the ticking of the clock. We must leave on 29 March 2019, at 11pm. That, in turn, means that the deal – if it is reached – has to be signed off in the very near future by the cabinet and then by parliament.No such agreement, of course, has yet been struck with Brussels. Theresa May’s senior ministers are far from consensus on what would constitute an acceptable plan. And the Commons resembles a cacophonous gathering of factions, all of them engaging in the narcissism of small differences as well as more principled position-taking. Yet over them still looms the clock, doing its merciless work, draining the argument of reflection, caution and historical perspective.In this context, the resignation of Jo Johnson on Friday was much more significant than his brother Boris’s in July. May had long contended with the possibility that cabinet Brexiteers would quit over her compromises with Brussels – indeed, she still does so, conscious that Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey are watching her like a trio of hawks, ready to fly away from the table as soon as she hands too much to the EU.This was always in the Brexit script: the outraged departure of ministers convinced that the dream of 2016 was being betrayed. But Johnson’s decision to quit as transport minister is much more significant: the first time that a senior remainer, a minister sometimes tipped as a future Tory leader, has left the government over our prospective exit from the EU. And he did so because he believes, correctly, that the prime minister is presenting the nation “with a choice between two deeply unattractive outcomes, vassalage and chaos”.The prospect of a no-deal exit – for which ministers are now preparing with the weary compliance of regional civil defence authorities in the cold war – is manifestly appalling. And what May calls a “deal” is, no less clearly, just a worse version of our existing relationship with the EU.In this respect, Johnson’s departure represents a fatal convergence between remainers and leavers, in the recognition that it is plain stupid to be an EU rule-taker but not a rule-maker. As the former education secretary Justine Greening told the Observer: “The parliamentary deadlock has been clear for some time. It’s crucial now for parliament to vote down this plan, because it is the biggest giveaway of sovereignty in modern times.”Remember that these are the words not of Jacob Rees-Mogg or David Davis but a campaigner for Britain’s continued membership of the EU. Like the younger Johnson, Greening insists that “the government and parliament must recognise we should give people a final say on Brexit”. Quite right, too.What remains mystifying – and depressing – is the extent to which so many notionally intelligent politicians believed that the negotiations would lead inexorably to a happier outcome. Naturally, they were warned, at first politely, that their fantasies were just that. As long ago as January 2017 (when his country held the rotating presidency of the EU), Joseph Muscat, the Maltese prime minister, told the UK: “We want a fair deal, but that fair deal needs to be inferior to membership.”This was, and remains, common sense. Yet the magical thinking of 2016 continued to hold sway: the EU needed us more than we needed them provisional free trade deals with the rest of the world would fall into our lap as exit approached the nation would exult in a collective surge of imminent emancipation.Only now – in the symbolic form of the intractable Irish border question – has the grim reality of the process started to be more generally acknowledged. You cannot be both in and out of the EU (on this, the hard Brexiteers are quite right). You cannot have a porous Irish border unless Northern Ireland, or the whole UK, stays in the EU customs union until the matter is resolved. And the power to end this “backstop” cannot be reserved, unilaterally, by the UK.All the logic – remember that? – points to an extension of article 50, more talks and a people’s vote. Much more probable is a political collapse in which May is ousted, or a general election is forced by parliamentary impasse – or both.Is Labour ready to take the strain? Because all this is going to happen very soon. Until then, the Brexit train grinds on to nowhere it is not the people that are sovereign, but the timetable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b9c03017f37cf5ae4abb6e10f1b8b1883dbc9d/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=033fdcb54cea5cd77db99e2bbf13e4bb","title":"have you already finished your christmas shopping","story":"One in five people in the UK get their Christmas present shopping done before December starts.

It’s a constant cause of nervousness for me as I plant out tomatoes and peppers each spring, not to mention being the meteorological end-of-the-party for pretty much all tender crops come the autumn. And, in London, the first really hard frost tends to strike right about now.There are some crops for which frost is not the enemy, but positively a bonus, dramatically improving their flavour. Here’s my guide to the crops that frost can benefit, the science of how it works and the ways gardeners can use it to their advantage.When the temperatures plummet, the water inside plant cells freezes and expands as it turns to ice. This ruptures the rigid wall of fibre that encircles each of the cells that make up the plant’s tissues, causing the building blocks of their physiology to burst.Plants that are able to survive freezing conditions have evolved ingenious ways to prevent this from happening. In the case of many vegetables, they do this by making their own antifreeze, which lowers the freezing point of the liquid in their cells, and it just so happens that this natural antifreeze is a tasty one.As sensors in the plant detect the falling temperatures, the plants rapidly ramp up the production of enzymes that break down the starch, normally used as an energy store, into simple sugars. It is the release of these sugars that ups the concentration of solids within their tissues and prevents it from freezing, like salt scattered on to roads, with the side effect of making crops taste sweeter. These sugars also help balance out the flavour of sour or bitter chemicals, resulting in better flavour.This phenomenon is, unsurprisingly, most dramatic in crops that contain large amounts of starch, and that means root crops (they are storage organs after all) such as parsnips, carrots, beetroot, turnips, swedes and celeriac. Even crops that aren’t technically hardy like sweet potatoes will do the same trick, their tubers protected from the worst of the temperatures by an insulating layer of soil after their top growth has long been obliterated. It is also noticeable in leaf and stem crops like leeks, Brussels sprouts and kale. In fact, even people who normally don’t much like the bitterness of sprouts (like me), find them much more palatable and even delicious after they have been sweetened by a touch of frost.The one exception to this rule is potatoes. Although the same phenomenon is at play, the excessive sugars and lack of starch cause the tubers to become mushy-textured, and often caramelise as they cook, making for watery, weirdly sweet-tasting mash and overly brown, soggy chips. But in the vast majority of winter veg, frost means a positive flavour boost.The best thing? You don’t have to do anything to get its benefits other than resisting the temptation to harvest too early, and simply enjoy the added flavour frost can bring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a594cb105fc93ab1d9d21ea7f1ce11dfb43395/12_332_5227_3137/master/5227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dc83d230e4c89a45cbf5867159b0a38","title":"national cycle network has many crap paths says charity in charge","story":"Almost half of the network has been rated ‘poor’ in a review to be published on MondayIt s 16,505 miles, is seven times longer than our motorway system and carries half as many people each year as the UK’s creaking railways – all for free and with no carbon emissions. But the National Cycle Network is so starved of funding that many of its bike paths are “crap” and desperately need improvements, according to the charity responsible for its development and upkeep.The network, marked by blue and red signs, includes 5,273 miles of traffic-free cycle paths, bridleways and canal towpaths used by millions of cyclists and walkers each year. It also incorporates 11,302 miles of “on-road” sections, covering the length and breadth of the UK from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End and from East Anglia to the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland.Xavier Brice, Sustrans chief executive, told the Sunday Times: “We’ve had enough of the crap bits and want to make it fit for everyone.”There are 15,680 incorrect, missing, obstructed or confusing signs on the network and 16,435 barriers, including steps, bollards and gates, according to the review.Other complaints include sections that turn into a “mud bath” each winter, slippery cattle grids and even the odd ford.Despite its name, the network is popular with walkers, joggers, wheelchair users and horse riders as well as people on bikes. More than half of the UK population lives within a mile of their nearest route and 4.4 million people used the Network last year, making 786m trips.Sustrans says it would cost £2.8bn to improve and expand the network. “This is a small amount compared to what we spend on the road network in the UK, and the return on investment is many times higher,” its review argues.Each year, the network saves the UK economy nearly £90m through reduced road congestion, according to Sustrans. Its health benefits save the NHS the equivalent of 2,206 nurses’ salaries, and leisure and tourist trips contribute £2.5bn to local economies, the charity claims.In his recent budget, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, pledged £30bn for road improvements targeted primarily at motorists.“Politicians across the UK are grappling with problems like congested roads, air pollution and increasing levels of obesity. In pure transport terms, the National Cycle Network presents a huge opportunity to transform the way people travel. But the benefits of investing in the network can be seen right across government like relieving pressure on the NHS budget,” said Brice.Sustrans receives £9m a year from the Scottish government to fund the network in Scotland but no guaranteed regular funding from the UK government for the English bits.My 11-mile cycle commute from Stockport to central Manchester uses two off-road sections of the National Cycle Network. In the summer, they are my favourite bits of the ride, taking in Reddish Vale country park – which includes a river, duckpond and splendid 17-arch viaduct – and the Fallowfield Loop, an old railway line that is a blackberry pickers’ paradise in early autumn. The problem is that neither are lit, so I won’t ride them alone to and from work in winter.Then there are the niggles. Route 62, which is part of the Trans Pennine Trail, idiotically directs cyclists down some steps in Reddish Vale. It also includes a number of access control gates, which are too narrow for mountain bike handlebars, and a few annoying horse stiles, which mean you have to get off and carry your bike across two wooden steps.I then join Route 6, which starts all the way down in London and will reach Threkeld in Cumbria when it’s finished. I only do four miles of it, however, to reach the student district of Fallowfield in south Manchester.

Arguably Turnage’s masterpiece, it hasn’t been heard in the UK since 2002, and its neglect in recent years is inexplicable.O’Casey’s depiction of footballing Harry Heegan, who returns to Ireland from the trenches in a wheelchair to be betrayed by those who once admired him, has been criticised for the unwieldy juxtaposition of its realistic portrayal of working class Dublin with the expressionism of its warfare scenes. Turnage’s score, however, bridges stylistic isions. The opera’s four acts are cast along symphonic lines: the opening allegro and whirling dance-hall finale convey the teeming complexity of Dublin life, while a gut-wrenching choral adagio for the soldiers in the trenches contrasts with the bitter scherzo of the hospital scene, in which Harry’s world falls apart. The structural tautness contains and offsets music of great anger, compassion and immediacy. It’s impossible not to be moved by it.The performance was tremendous. Wigglesworth prised open the score with fiery intensity and formidable control, inexorably ratcheting up the tension as the evening progressed and immaculate in his judgment of orchestral colour and detail. The cast was consistently strong. Ashley Riches, who is rapidly emerging as one of today’s finest young singers, made an outstanding Harry, his initial exuberance giving way to tangible frustration and despair. Mark le Brocq and Susan Bickley were deeply touching as his fretful parents, struggling to comprehend the nature of his injuries, both physical and psychological. Marcus Farnsworth and Claire Booth were also superb as the maritally embattled Forans, whose private tragedy mirrors the Heegans’ own, while Louise Alder and Sally Matthews played glamorous Jessie and religious Susie, the women whose failures of emotional understanding increase the bitterness of Harry’s isolation. The choral singing, from the BBC Singers, was wonderful in its commitment and fervour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33f44941b6950583dcd6b7bf33559a6492251f4a/0_200_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dcc3e37d346dd23e742a67fd00801ba","title":"taking on the eu podcast","story":"The former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis staked his political career on getting a deal with the European Union – and lost.

Sources suggested negotiators on both sides had agreed it would be impossible for the UK to unilaterally exit its backstop on Northern Ireland, a key Brexiter demand.But as some sought to reconcile the Tory party’s ided positions, Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, used his  column published in Monday’s newspaper to call for a Cabinet mutiny and wrote that the government ‘‘seemed to be on the verge of total surrender”.The prime minister, he continued, had “recommended to the cabinet not only that we agree to stay in the customs union under the so-called ‘backstop’ arrangement, but that we actually abdicate the power to leave that backstop.“Under the shameful proposals now before cabinet it will be up to some joint UKEU committee, or some ‘independent arbitration mechanism’ to decide whether the UK – an ancient and sovereign nation – is finally allowed to come out.”A review mechanism involving a joint committee, with European court of justice oversight, allowing May the ability to claim that her all-UK customs union backstop was not permanent, is likely to be the best the government can expect in negotiations.The talks are now focusing on EU demands on “level playing field” commitments over competition and state aid, as well as social and environmental protections, to ensure UK businesses are not able to undercut European industry.The UK has already said it is open to non-regression clauses in a future trade deal that would prevent it from lowering standards. Brussels is demanding “dynamic” alignment, which would force parliament to “cut and paste” EU regulations as they come in after Brexit, without giving Britain any say. has learned that EU member states are insisting on having time to scrutinise this part  before it is made public. One senior diplomat said: “We cannot be left in the dark on this now, it is too important.”UK government sources attempted to play down expectations that negotiators would reach agreement in time for the cabinet meeting. If they fail, there will not be an emergency EU summit in November and the prime minister will have to press ahead with “no deal” preparations in case negotiations ultimately falter.May is expected to face anger from cabinet Brexiters over her exit mechanism plans.Yet cabinet sources suggested that disgruntled ministers would stop short of quitting over the exit mechanism plan. Even if they were “bounced” into agreeing to the deal, May would still face a serious challenge getting it through the Commons.Leadsom told BBC Radio 5 Live: “I am working towards getting a deal that does not require the UK to be stuck, trapped in a customs arrangement. I’m sticking in government to make sure that’s where we get to in the end.”She added: “The UK cannot be held against its will in a customs arrangement. It must be capable for the United Kingdom to decide to leave that customs arrangement and it cannot be something that the European Union can then hold us to.“And, frankly, it’s because that would be to then fail to fulfil on the will of the people expressed in the referendum and I very much doubt that we would get it through parliament.”Cabinet Brexiters have pushed for a unilateral route, with the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, the first to say publicly the power to leave the backstop – the UK’s insurance policy if talks fail – should rest with the “sovereign” British government.The education secretary, Damian Hinds, said the EU would not accept that plan. “If you have too hard a line about saying, ‘well, we must just have a totally unilateral exit, or there’s an absolutely fixed, hard end date’, that is very, very unlikely that is going to be negotiable with the other side,” he said.He urged an alliance of Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, who have said they will join forces to vote down May’s withdrawal plans, to “think about the alternatives”, saying there would be “trade-offs” in any deal.The latest plan under discussion is believed to include the option of pushing ahead with a “successor agreement” that would set out the full trading relationship between the EU and UK by late 2020, and extending the transition period if needed.As a last resort a UK-wide backstop would kick in, with Northern Ireland aligned more closely with single market rules to avoid a hard border, inevitably prompting a showdown with the DUP, who oppose any trade border in the Irish Sea.The prime minister also faces growing pressure to press the button on her no-deal preparations. Gen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, told the BBC the military “stands ready to help in any way we can” in the event of no deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcfbb5e6f4f613097e61d3c079cc5e168bf8fa10/77_143_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b7f2c4e9e97d3372343db50998d9d6d","title":"sports quiz week manchester city united f1 wayne rooney","story":"Who scored?

Yet while he did win the Brazilian Grand Prix this was an almost unexpected victory that had turned on a moment. Max Verstappen had put in a superb drive only to be denied the top step after a clash left his chances spiralling away as Hamilton swept into the lead to ensure Mercedes clinched their fifth consecutive world constructors’ championship.The win was far from one of the relentless dominance Hamilton has displayed in the second half of the season but he and the team did not allow it to dampen their ardour for a remarkable achievement.With Hamilton’s fifth drivers’ title clinched in Mexico, Mercedes have now equalled Ferrari’s record of five consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ championship doubles the Scuderia scored with Michael Schumacher between 2000 and 2004.“We’ve just won the world championship for the fifth time so that’s real history in the making for the team,” he said. “If I was to stop today, for example, Mercedes would always remember this day and that I was a part of it, and that’s cool.” The team principal, Toto Wolff, reflected the satisfaction his team felt after they had been pushed harder than at any other point in the turbo-hybrid era. “It was a very difficult season,” he said. “We had ups and downs, Ferrari came back strongly and Red Bull at the end but that makes the championship victory even more enjoyable.”But the race had been all about Verstappen, who could barely contain his fury by its close. Hamilton had started from pole and held his lead from the off but Mercedes could not push hard on their tyres as Red Bull’s race pace proved mighty and it quickly became clear the fight was with Verstappen.He had started from fifth but charged from the off, in short order passing Kimi Räikkönen, who finished third, Sebastian Vettel and Valtteri Bottas to take second within 10 laps. He then drove a masterful stint, managing his tyres and staying out for 16 more laps than Hamilton before his stop. It enabled him to emerge on the quicker, soft tyres, which paid off.Four laps later Hamilton was powerless to resist as the Dutchman’s extra grip allowed him to sweep past for the lead on the start-finish straight.He quickly pulled away and the race was clearly in Verstappen’s hands until on lap 44 he was hit by Esteban Ocon at turn two, causing him to spin and drop five seconds to Hamilton and damage his floor. Ocon was a lap down and trying to unlap himself, an unnecessary risk against the race leader who was in front through the corner. “What a fucking idiot,” was Verstappen’s response. Ocon was given a stop-go penalty for the incident, cold comfort for Verstappen as Hamilton was able to hold his lead to the flag.The Dutchman was understandably furious, a mood that had clearly not improved by the end of the race and the situation looked like flaring up as he repeatedly shoved Ocon in the weigh-in area. “We are passionate about the sport, it would be odd if I shook his hand,” he said. When asked about the incident later he was terse: “I don’t really have a lot to comment on that, except that he was being a pussy”. Both drivers were subsequently summoned to the stewards and Verstappen was punished with two days of public service at the direction of the FIA.He was backed by the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner. “As a lapped car you should not interfere with the leader,” he said. “What was Ocon thinking of there, it beggars belief. It makes no sense at all.”He also defended his driver’s post‑race actions. “Esteban was lucky to get away with a push, to be honest. Max has lost a victory through no fault of his own. It is hugely frustrating to lose a victory through a back marker.”For Hamilton, however, the win was all as he and the team rightly celebrated. The record book will show only the victory and one that maintains an extraordinary record that illustrates his dominance for half a decade. He has now averaged 10 wins every season since 2014. Verstappen once again proved his credentials but ultimately the weekend belonged to Hamilton and Mercedes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214d5f093b407bb5a0d76407b1b4594d2d6473d5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2c282e35bc78683111ea48dac28c9c7","title":"pinter three four review tamsin greig lee evans pinter theatre london","story":"Harold Pinter theatre, LondonGreig shows nothing is now beyond her range while Evans’s physical comedy is a delight as this short-drama season highlights Pinter’s fascination with marital solitudeJamie Lloyd’s six-month season of Pinter’s one-act plays is proving instructive and pleasurable. The opening programme reminded us of Pinter’s preoccupation with the roots of power. This new pairing demonstrates his fascination with marital solitude and capacity to write great parts for actors. Tamsin Greig, in Pinter Three, reveals an emotional range that suggests nothing in the classic or modern rep is now beyond her.Greig appears first in Landscape, from 1969 – Pinter’s study of a married couple, Beth and Duff, who seem to exist in separate worlds. Greig, speaking into a stand mic, employs a soft Irish lilt that intensifies Beth’s lyrical remembrance of past passion. Keith Allen as Duff, in Lloyd’s inventive production, hits a note of violent exasperation as he desperately tries to communicate with his detached wife.Greig is even more extraordinary as Deborah in A Kind of Alaska (1982), based on an Oliver Sacks case study. She combines the vocal register of a teenage girl with the terror of a woman returning to consciousness – and an unrecognisable world – after a 29-year sleep. But Lloyd’s production makes clear that the real tragedy lies in the irreparable gulf between the doctor who has lovingly tended her (Allen) and his estranged wife (a bleakly discomfited Meera Syal).Both these pieces leave one wrung through. Lee Evans brings idiosyncratic eccentricity, however, to some of the shorter pieces. In Monologue (1973), he plays a loner trapped in the present but feeding off an imagined past, brilliantly deploying perpetually sidelong glances and a body whose limbs seem to exist in a permanent state of civil war. Evans teams up with Tom Edden to hilarious effect in a famous revue sketch, Trouble in the Works (1959) as he itemises, with mounting despair, the workers’ revolt against the bronze draw-off cock “with or without handwheel”. Pinter Three is terrific.Many of the same themes recur in Pinter Four, comprising Moonlight (1993) and Night School (1960), but the effect is patchier. This is partly because Lyndsey Turner’s production of the former is a bit clunky. Moonlight captures well the sad strangeness of the marriage between a dying, scatological civil servant and his semi-detached wife, well played by Robert Glenister and Brid Brennan. But you never feel, as you should, that their estranged sons and ethereal daughter inhabit their own distinct, inviolable worlds.Night School, written for television, fares much better in Ed Stambollouian’s production. This is early funny-mysterious Pinter about a woman (a sprightly Jessica Barden) who effortlessly leads a dual life as schoolteacher and nightclub hostess. Pinter’s dialogue is sharply comic: Al Weaver, as the heroine’s besotted admirer, gazes at her, rapturously announcing: “Your eyes, they’re northern eyes. They’re full of soot.” A virtually unrecognisable Janie Dee gives a vivid study of one of Weaver’s aunts – a bustling spinster whose every look and stride seems to carry a hint of reproach.It is good to be reminded of Pinter’s gift for comedy. But the abiding impression of the two evenings is of Pinter’s periodic view of the marital state as, in Beckett’s words, “alone together, so much shared”.

They enable people to open their front door, access their office or start their car with a wave of their hand, and can also store medical data.Another company, Biohax of Sweden, also provides human chip implants the size of a grain of rice. It told the Sunday  (£) that it is in discussions with several British legal and financial firms about fitting their employees with microchips, including one major company with hundreds of thousands of employees.The CBI, which represents 190,000 UK businesses, voiced concerns about the prospect.A CBI spokesperson said: “While technology is changing the way we work, this makes for distinctly uncomfortable reading. Firms should be concentrating on rather more immediate priorities and focusing on engaging their employees.”The TUC is worried that staff could be coerced into being microchipped. Its general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “We know workers are already concerned that some employers are using tech to control and micromanage, whittling away their staff’s right to privacy.“Microchipping would give bosses even more power and control over their workers. There are obvious risks involved, and employers must not brush them aside, or pressure staff into being chipped.”Steven Northam, the founder and owner of Hampshire-based BioTeq, told the  that most of its 150 implants have been for iniduals, while some financial and engineering firms have also had the chips implanted in their staff.BioTeq has also implanted them in employees of a bank testing the technology, and has shipped them to Spain, France, Germany, Japan and China.They cost between £70 and £260 per person. Northam himself and all the directors at BioTeq and one of his other companies, IncuHive, have been microchipped.Last year Wisconsin-based Three Square Market partnered with Biohax and became the first company in the US to microchip its employees, on a voluntary basis.KPMG, one of the big four accountancy firms, said it was not planning to microchip its employees and “would under no circumstances consider doing so”.Fellow accounting firms EY and PwC also said they would not consider microchipping their employees. Deloitte declined to comment.Biohax has plans to open an office in London, according to its website. It claims 4,000 people have been microchipped, mostly in Sweden. It is working with the state-owned Swedish rail firm Statens Järnvägar, to allow its passengers to travel via chip implants rather than train tickets. Biohax did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/027774668281b0d4310ac7f1e2b4602a9b55295a/0_138_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ad565ca06cdfd36df2aefd07aa2c1df","title":"send a tip on independent tour guides for a chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tells us about engaging, amusing and knowledgeable tour guides the world over whose services you have enjoyedA good guide or local contact can make a crucial difference to your enjoyment of a trip, bringing a destination to life with their passion, storytelling and wit.

As everyone knows, Time Travel 101 dictates: going back into your own timeline is only going to lead to bother. But with Yaz clearly emerging as her favourite (Hooray! Yaz episode!), off we go. Yaz’s granny Umbrine starts doling out family heirlooms and gets testy after Yaz starts asking questions about her gift of Yaz’s grandfather’s watch. Yaz won’t let it lie. “What’s the point in having a mate with a time machine if you can’t go back and see your nan when she was young?”So before long we find ourselves in 1940s Punjab farmland, not the city of Lahore as PC Khan had expected. And when Prem, the man young Umbrine is set to marry is clearly not Yaz’s grandfather, her police instincts kick in and here we are again, interfering in our own history. Where will this end? If we end up with “Bradley Walsh and the Pearly Kings battle the Krays”, I for one am out.The latest addition to Chris Chibnall’s stable of all-new writers is Vinay Patel, best known for BBC Three’s acclaimed drama Murdered By My Father. Patel is one of only two writers of colour the series has ever had and, just like Malorie Blackman, has written a story rooted in race. In fact, there’s only really a surface similarity between Demons of the Punjab and Rosa, in that both feature a Back to the Future-ish race to avoid altering the course of history. Chibnall’s aim with his historical stories is to tackle meaty societal issues we could really do with reminding about.So once again, the big bad is prejudice itself, here in the form of Prem’s tantrummy little brother Manish, who has spent too long “reading pamphlets and listening to angry men on the radio,” causing him to move into extremism. Unable to countenance his Hindu brother marrying a Muslim, he shoots the poor Holy Man due to bless the ceremony, sparking the fear of the phantom alien invasion that was never coming. Rather than sci-fi elements, it’s two family tragedies that ground the historical settings here. Prem couldn’t save Manish (or himself) from the turbulence of history, while Umbrine’s secrecy came simply from the trauma of being widowed on her wedding day.Given the subject matter, this is an inevitably heavy helping of Who. But despite everything, it was quite easily the strongest of the series so far.The partition of India was the ision of British India in 1947, causing the creation of the two independent nations of India and Pakistan. Umbrine’s family live right on the border, the Radcliffe line, the tensions over which lead Umbrine and her mother to flee. The radio broadcast we hear was the real-life announcement of the borders by Lord Mountbatten in 1947. The rest is uncomfortable history.Doctor Who has had a tendency to sugarcoat its historical periods. None of that here. The Doctor makes no bones to Yaz: “It’s not just the country that gets ided. Tens of millions of people about to be displaced. More than a million about to die.” There is only soft reference to British culpability in what occurred.There have been a few people below the line who feel this series is laying its liberal credentials on a bit thick. Well, perhaps, but these are things we cannot really afford not to keep on saying. I wonder if it’s just a coincidence that this episode goes out on Remembrance Sunday?One of the nice things about this year’s crowded Tardis is the little quiet moments we get between different combinations of characters. We’ve not seen much of Yaz and Graham together , but it’s a beautiful moment when we do here “I don’t think any of us know the real truth of our lives because we’re too busy living them from the inside.” It’s nice to see him offer some father-figurely wisdom in a situation becoming overwhelming to her.Meanwhile, it was mentioned below the line last week that for all that everyone loves Jodie, the Doctor has historically always been a bit of a sod. I agree, and hope a bit of that is on the way. That wedding speech was as sick-bucket as it was beautiful.Once again, the alien menace is quite the red herring. The bizarre, crow-like Monks the Vajarians have evolved out of their previous badass assassin identities now roam through time and space to bear witness and pay tribute to those who die alone. The line “you will leave or we will stand over your corpses” tallies with that outlook, but you can see why the Doctor might have misinterpreted it. Though it should really have been obvious really from the fact that they’re all sporting floral print summer dresses of the kind of Lisa Snowdon would pick out to makeover a medical receptionist on a This Morning fashion segment.

We tend to think this means recently born, but what if – as every sign seems to suggest – it’s David Attenborough? What if being born into privilege (that’s not meant as snide commentary – just an acknowledgement of fact) and spending the 70-odd years of your working life doing something you love and that, by its very nature, kept you mentally and physically fit while western medicine and other technologies developed all the miracles you might need to aid you in your progress … Maybe you would need never die?For when he goes, the sky shall be rent asunder and every mountain and island whose flora and fauna he has spent his life documenting shall move out of their places. In short, it will be a big thing.Dynasties (BBC One), a quintet of episodes four years in the making and devoted to the five most celebrated and endangered species on Earth, is his own most recent big thing. Although it has possibly been slightly diminished by the simultaneous announcement of his collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund and Netflix to narrate the eight-episode Our Planet next year.Last night’s opening episode was about chimpanzees because – and you know this is true – they’re the best. Next week is penguins, who are obviously great, and lions, tigers and wolves will all get their day in the documentary sun. But chimps they’re the best.Using the work of anthropologist Jill Pruetz, who has been studying the animals for 20 years to understand their power games and politics, the Dynasties team follow a troop of chimpanzees in Senegal, west Africa, and its alpha male David’s determination to hang on to his leadership as rivals gather. (Note: I shall be drawing no analogies. It would be exhausting.)At first, we are treated to a run-through of all the classics. Baby chimps splash and frolic at watering holes. Mothers watch indulgently. Adults dextrously poke grass stems into termite mounds and munch thoughtfully on the bugs they catch. But David can never let his guard down. He keeps a particular eye on young males Luther and Jumpkin, the most likely contenders for his crown. His toes twitch whenever they edge too close. A strategic alliance with another male – older than David and no challenger, but still powerful – via some literal back-scratching, is enough to repel one attempted coup, but next time David is not so lucky. After a fire and under pressure from a drought and the coming of several females into season – events, dear boy, events – David’s toes start to twitch again. In the night, the troop’s young males turn on him. His toes no longer twitching, fingers missing, great gouges in his flesh and foam dried to a white crust around his mouth, he looks to have been killed.Incredibly, he is still alive. The females and children lick his wounds until the group has to leave in search of water. And, while Luther sets about instilling fear and panic in the group so that he can shore up his position as – why do I want to call it president? – David slowly regains enough strength to follow them. And when he finds them, Luther runs. David is restored to fragile power without a blow being struck. He makes a few more allies, the better to protect himself next time – and there will always be a next time – gets a female pregnant and nine months later has a son. David is now the longest-reigning alpha male in the group’s known history.If you have any scrap of humility in you it is impossible to look from them to us and back again and not shake your head in something between wry resignation and simple despair at how little we have managed to change over the thousands of generations that stand – you would think significantly – between us. Dress it up with elections, referendums, ballot boxes, agrarian farming, industrial economies, marriage ceremonies, religion and Deliveroo all you want we are still all just animals fighting over resources and angling for the power that will get us more than our fair share. The chimps’ honesty in their operations only makes them seem the more civilised.Hominid, know thyself. And may Attenborough reign as long as David."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c196886453c76ec44459a5a84e0c05accf67c968/66_0_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d300755adcb7e0856b5e9881ac38159","title":"south park al gore apology climate change manbearpig","story":"The usually unrepentant show said sorry for mocking Gore over climate change but managed not to compromise. The Simpsons might well take noteThis week, South Park offered something it has rarely offered, much less given, in 21 years of mercilessly skewering public figures: an apology.It was offered to Al Gore, the former vice-president who first visited South Park 12 years ago – or at least a bearded, high-pitched 2D version of himself did, voiced by co-creator Trey Parker.In that episode, Gore tried to warn Kenny, Kyle and Stan about an imaginary monster called ManBearPig which roamed the earth, attacking humans. The kids agreed to help him find it but in the process of trying to kill it, they all nearly died. The monster was never found but a preening Gore became a star. As Stan put it: “You just use ManBearPig to get attention for yourself because you’re a loser!”Climate change is fiction, fighting it will cause more harm than good, Gore only keeps bringing it up because he wants the spotlight. The allegory has not dated well.Still, South Park went out of its way to give Gore a hard time for trying to focus the world’s attention on climate issues, which the cartoon suggested were inherently uncooool.Gore never demanded an apology and only relatively dedicated students of the series have criticised the episode. One such critic, Deidre M Pike, is the author of a book, Enviro-Toons: Green Themes in Animated Cinema and Television.“Environmentalists,” Pike wrote, “might feel as threatened by this show as they were by various environmental resolutions enacted by the Bush administration.”This week, Parker and Matt Stone took action, with an episode that begins with the revelation that ManBearPig is actually real. The grotesque and murderous beast wreaks murderous havoc. Only Al Gore can stop it, of course, and so the children have to ask for his help.Gore is initially unwilling and demands grovelling, repeated apologies. It turns out the only way stop the terror is to continually tell Gore he was right. And thus, South Park manages to find a way to apologise repeatedly while still mocking Gore as a narcissist, who wears a Nobel medal and a cape.As this is South Park, there are lots of other zeitgeisty punchlines. The police believe the killings are school shootings and are therefore blase. Gore would rather be playing Red Dead Redemption.Many TV shows which felt groundbreaking even a decade ago now appear problematic. Friends, Seinfeld and Ally McBeal: all have been criticised for demeaning attitudes to women and a lack of minority characters. But they are still celebrated as products of their time.Shows which began in the 1990s and are still going face a different, more complicated reckoning. The most high-profile example has been The Simpsons, in which the character of Apu has been severely criticised for stereotyping south-Asian Americans. The makers of the show have responded bitterly and a dispute continues.South Park has demonstrated more humility, while managing to stay funny. It acknowledged a major misstep without any pressure to do so and found a way to apologise while remaining on brand. And for good measure, it had an episode this season which mocked the Simpsons’ saga.Entitled A Problem With A Poo, it saw long-running character Mr Hanky The Christmas Poo run out of town because of political correctness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72c830c8a8fd0e1c4d5263e91315758de98d30e0/0_54_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d3b581dfdbfd9bebe450933290cee96","title":"the little drummer girl recap episode three a coolly calculated chess game","story":"We’ve now reached the halfway mark. Was there ever any doubt that Charlie would accept her mission to ferry explosives across multiple borders? SPOILER ALERT: This recap contains spoilers for episode two of The Little Drummer Girl. You can read the episode two recap hereWhen does the “theatre of the real” get too real? Episode three of the Little Drummer Girl started with a God’s eye view of a red Mercedes lined with explosives snaking through Greek country roads, and ended with that same vehicle erupting into a fireball on a German autobahn. Staged by Kurtz (Michael Shannon) and his team, it was a coolly calculated and highly extrajudicial execution: killing SalimMichel and his pretty courier Anna, perpetrators of the Bad Godesberg bombing that opened the series. An act of vengeance, then, but one purposefully designed to keep the conflict going.By arranging to blow up these wanted terrorists in Germany, Kurtz was giving his local police asset Paul Alexis – lover of cheesecake and useful intel – an easy way to wrap up the Bad Godesberg case. There was also an ulterior motive: to flush out the real target, master bomber Khalil. Investigating the final movements of his baby brother, Salim, should lead Khalil along a carefully embroidered paper trail of love letters and hotel receipts a trail that ends with Charlie (Florence Pugh). She may dabble in Scrabble but Kurtz is playing chess, thinking three moves ahead.Was there ever any doubt that Charlie would accept her mission to ferry explosives across multiple borders? The episode began with her already en route and fiddling with the car radio but then, in one of the weird rewind flourishes that have become a hallmark of this drama, we were back at her al fresco briefing with Becker (Alexander Skarsgård). Like an acting exercise, he issued most of his instructions to her in character as her lover Michel, even if his aside about the cargo – “Semtex is popular because it is stable, but I wouldn’t light a cigarette in there” – seemed to be pure deadpan Becker. Then, with a Jason Bourne-esque stack of different Euro currencies, she was off.In his Munich safe house, Kurtz suddenly decided to pull back the curtain for SalimMichel, marching his captive out of his wired-for-sound “cell” and revealing that the prison ordeal had all been staged (including some pre-Photoshop faked Polaroids crafted by Mr Schwilli). That Salim would open up about how he informed his comrades of their next bombing target after some tentative bonding with Kurtz over their formative hardships felt a little implausible, although admittedly he had recently been drugged to the eyeballs. Had Kurtz already decided his prisoner’s ultimate fate at this point? It seems likely.After a tetchy Scrabble game with her handler, Rachel, to confirm she was to park the Mercedes in Gutigplatz, Charlie craftily stuffed the boot with Yugoslavian firewater before crossing the border into Austria. The initially suspicious guards waved her through while, in the fine tradition of border guards in 1970s Europe, retaining the bootleg liquid evidence for further investigation. After leaving the car in position, Charlie stashed the keys in the exhaust and made a beeline for Becker, who was disguised as a suspiciously hunky priest in a nearby cafe.Leaving Kurtz’s eager lieutenant Shimon to oversee the stakeout – which identified preening biker and “petty little leftwing journalist” Rossino as the next link in the bombing chain – Charlie had a solo post-mission celebration in a garish hotel room, slaying the minibar and lounging in a magnificent orangebrown tiled bathroom suite. Becker dropped by to insist she had done a good thing but after the expulsion of all that nervous energy, Charlie fell asleep. Never off-mission, Becker dutifully created the illusion of a lover’s tryst, leaving room service in disarray.Then, in Munich, the real debrief. Charlie was brought face-to-face with the man she was supposed to be in love with, who, propped up between the shoulders of his captors, seemed terribly young and vulnerable. (Meanwhile, in one of the drama’s creepiest cutaways, his accomplice Anna was screaming in the soundproofed cell just feet away.) During the uncomfortable scene of Charlie memorising distinguishing marks on Salim’s naked body, the magnitude of what she was being asked to do seemed to overwhelm her. Outside, she confronted Becker with his real name – which she winkled out of Rachel during their Scrabble game – and we saw his composure slip: “Never call me Gadi again.”If there was initially a glamour to the idea of playing spy games, Charlie was now reduced to scribbling out carefully concocted love letters with different pens to convince Salim’s comrades that their relationship was so all-encompassing that she can be trusted. Reading these love notes aloud with Becker – still, to her, Joseph – made her, not for the first time, reach out for him and, rather mechanically, he responded. Does he really care for her or was he dutifully playing the handler’s role, giving an asset whatever support they need to get the job done? What could have been a cathartic love scene then warped into something more horrifying, a hallucinogenic nightmare where Charlie saw Salim instead of Joseph in her embrace while Kurtz and his team looked on.Where does that leave Charlie? Back in London, in a flat where the phone is tapped and passionate love letters have been planted in her guitar case, uneasily waiting for someone to make contact. As Kurtz noted in Munich: “From now on, we won’t be writing the play … the play will come to you.” No wonder she’s knocking back pints at her local snooker club.That prolonged stakeout in the town square, with slow tracking zooms through slightly wobbly telescopic lenses, suggests director Park Chan-wook is a fan of paranoid 1970s thrillers such as The Conversation and was keen to evoke a similar feeling of cramped tension. It was also intriguing to see that Shimon’s post-stakeout interception of Anna as she drove away the red Mercedes – a scene referenced but not actually described in the original novel – was mostly viewed in a long and very wide shot that emphasised how chaotic it was for four operatives to subdue one determinedly agitated woman. Park loves a prolonged single take (even if he couldn’t resist cutting to a close-up when Anna took a chomp on Shimon’s ear)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47ea68e1a21d04862cc235b8cfd9fe08d983ff5e/0_84_4090_2454/master/4090.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5dd357e5af2b9ab2da37b85d54fb52a","title":"a nations thank you 10000 pay tribute to family members in the peoples procession","story":"Relatives of first world war veterans walked through London, clutching medals and photographs and sharing storiesSome marched for grandfathers and great-grandfathers who were among the survivors to clamber from the trenches in the drizzle of that November day.Others marched for great-uncles and great-great-uncles a fallen generation never to become fathers and known only through sepia photographs and the names chiselled on local war memorials.This was not a military parade. But as 10,000 people, who were chosen by ballot, gathered for the people’s procession at the Cenotaph in London, family medals adorned chests, glinting in autumnal sunshine. They carried wreaths and photographs and thoughts of Laurence Binyon’s immortal words: “We will remember them.”Described as “a nation’s thank you”, this was the chance for descendants to pay tribute to family members, now gone, at the national memorial. It was important, said Kate Nicholls, “because the generation who had first-hand knowledge are dying out, not just those who served, but those they told”.Nicholls, from Ealing, west London, was walking for her great-grandfather, John Waugh, who was 28 when he was killed in action, two weeks before armistice, “which makes it seem doubly senseless,” she said. His older brother, Tommy, survived, despite being left for dead at the Somme, and hiding under dead bodies in no man’s land for three days to stay alive. Remarkably, just before John was killed, the brothers were briefly reunited at a field clinic in Flanders where their sister, Violet, was a nurse.Jackie Sheridan, from Syston near Leicester, in her Scout-leader uniform, saluted as the procession passed the Cenotaph. “Then I looked down, and saw all the wreaths, and it really brought it home to me. I welled up. It was very emotional,” she said. She was attending with her husband, Steven, to remember her great-great-uncle, Oliver Davies, of the Royal Engineers, who died in Palestine aged 21, on 2 December 1917, when he was hit by a stray bullet.She has the letter, now fragile, which was sent to the family by his captain. He informed them of the mortal wounds and the fact he had made a cross for Davies’s grave. She has a photograph of a sketch of that cross on her phone.“It’s important to show your respect,” she said, “I have a grandson who is only nine months old and I hope when he is old enough we will still carry on.”The procession had mustered on the Mall, where giant screens relayed the nation’s wreath-laying ceremony in Whitehall, just yards away across Horse Guards Parade. As the chimes of Big Ben signalled the 100th anniversary of the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, heads bowed as many remembered stories told by long-departed loved ones who had lived the full horror of the first world war. Loud cannon fire ended the two-minute silence. Over loudspeakers, strains of The Last Post played by Royal Marine buglers filled the still air.At 12.30pm, as Big Ben struck once more to signal the pealing of bells across the country, and across the world, the procession set off.For Julia Knowles, the day had begun at 6am, with a pipers’ lament in howling rain in her village of Chaldon, Surrey. Now, in sunshine, she and her husband, Bob, were paying tribute to her grandfather, Arthur Hines. He survived the war, and went on to marry a young French woman he met in Lille. But all his life he kept a letter sent to him by the mother of a fallen comrade, thanking him for taking the trouble to write to her about her son.“I thought it was really wonderful,” she said of the procession. “What really struck me was that absolutely everybody had their own story,” she said.Leigh Todd, from Scarborough, wanted to mark the life of her great-aunt, Nancy Allen, whose fiance was killed. She never married or had children. “She never stopped wearing black, and she kept the letters he wrote to her in a chocolate tin,” she said. She was one of countless women robbed of the future they had hoped for.At the Cenotaph, the 10,000 walked slowly passed, just as 1 million had done so before them when it was first hastily erected from wood and plaster to commemorate the “Great Deliverance” from the unimaginable agony of what was supposed to be the war to end all wars. The memorial designed by Edwin Lutyens in Portland stone, which replaced that first cenotaph in 1920, has had a busy history since it first became the focal point for commemorations.The last veterans from the first world war are gone. Those from the second world war are fading. Perhaps, many of those gathered hoped, a people’s procession could become part of the nation’s annual commemoration.Clutching a frame, inside of which he had mounted his father’s war medals and a photograph of his father, Derek Gregory hoped it would not be the last. “I think they should do it every year,” said the 88-year-old from Sidmouth, Devon. “It would be unforgivable if it all just faded away.”His father, Albert James Gregory, of the South Wales Borderers, had been gassed, but survived. His medals almost didn’t. Albert, who suffered health problems as a result of of his experiences in the war, threw them in the coal hole in disgust at the lack of welfare assistance offered to veterans after the first world war. His wife later managed to retrieve two, both of which were carried past the Cenotaph by his son in this unique commemoration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42c032c546e79d3c729dfc6f09861f406c5a36dc/0_179_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c28b088ac358406ed47dea6ca57583","title":"poland far right independence centenary","story":"Nationalists burning flares and carrying fascist flags marched at same time as politiciansMore than 200,000 people are estimated to have taken part in a controversial independence-day march through central Warsaw on Sunday, after a last-minute agreement was struck between senior politicians and the event’s far-right organisers.The March of Independence, organised by nationalist and far-right groups and held annually in the Polish capital on 11 November to commemorate the anniversary of the re-establishment of the country’s independence in 1918, has grown dramatically in scale over the past decade, attracting activists from across Europe.Last year’s event, which attracted an estimated 60,000 people, received international condemnation for the presence of racist and xenophobic banners and slogans and violence directed at counterprotesters.There was widespread concern in Poland that the march would overshadow official commemorations of the centenary of the country’s rebirth as an independent state at the end of the first world war. Preparations were thrown into chaos on Wednesday after Warsaw’s outgoing mayor, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, announced she was banning the march due to concerns surrounding security and “aggressive nationalism”.Hours after Gronkiewicz-Waltz’s announcement Andrzej Duda, Poland’s rightwing president, announced the Polish state would be organising its own march at the same time and along the same route as the nationalist march. But it was unclear what would happen if a court overturned the mayor’s ban, which it did on Thursday evening.That led to frantic negotiations between the Polish authorities and nationalist organisations, resulting in an agreement in which participants in the state-sanctioned section of the event would march first, followed closely behind by participants in the nationalist march, separated by a cordon of military police.Lining up in parallel columns, Polish soldiers stood side-by-side with members of the National-Radical Camp (ONR), the successor to a pre-war Polish fascist movement, and representatives of Forza Nuova, an Italian neo-fascist movement, as they were addressed by Duda at the march’s inauguration.“I want us to walk under our white-and-red banners together and in an air of joy. To give honour to those who fought for Poland, and to be glad that it is free, sovereign and independent,” Duda said, before leading the crowd in chants of “glory and praise to the heroes” and a rendition of the national anthem.Dwarfing previous iterations of the march in terms of size, this year’s event appeared to feature far fewer overtly racist banners and symbols than last year, although white supremacist symbols such as the Celtic cross were present, and some media outlets reported instances of racist chanting.The far-right All-Polish Youth, a co-organiser of the march, posted a video of an EU flag being set on fire on the march, as some people chanted “down with the European Union.”Poland’s political isions were also on display, as police in riot gear separated marchers from counter-demonstrators gathered under a large banner reading “Constitution”. Some marchers threw objects and fireworks, making obscene gestures and labelling their opponents prostitutes and communists.Many of those marching sought to distance themselves from any controversy, saying they simply wished to celebrate their country’s independence.“I just want to celebrate the 100th anniversary. To see all these Polish flags, it’s a beautiful view. I am not involved in politics, I am not involved in the war between politicians,” said Piotr, a biotechnologist from Kraków who was attending the march for the first time. “The atmosphere is very good – except for a couple of groups whose slogans are not OK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74d420d37e4e97150c880c51bafdd57057d95df7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06fc62862089eeec38b282615d9d9dd8","title":"can they really pull it off the apec summit comes to papua new guinea","story":"Poorest country in bloc to host meeting of world leaders for first time – but some can’t even bring themselves to stay overnightIt is likely to end, as all Apec leaders summits do, with world leaders, including Xi Jinping, Mike Pence, Shinzo Abe, Justin Trudeau and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, donning matching shirts and posing awkwardly for a photo op.But this week world leaders will arrive in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, for an Apec unlike any other.This is the first time Papua New Guinea, the poorest country among the 21 countries of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) bloc, has hosted the summit.PNG ranks around 130th worldwide for GDP and 135th in the corruption perception index, and Port Moresby is consistently ranked one of the most dangerous cities in the world, which could be the reason that at least one leader – Mike Pence – will not be staying in the host country, but will be flying in and out from the Australian city of Cairns.The PNG government hopes that the nation will emerge with trade agreements and a new standing on the world stage, but the the arrival of thousands of people will test the country. The road to Apec has been a rocky and unconventional one, involving three cruise ships, 40 Maseratis and Hillary Clinton.Clinton, in fact, is where it all started, says Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands program for the Lowy Institute, a Sydney thinktank.One story commonly told in Australian diplomatic circles is that the idea was first floated by the former US secretary for state in 2012 when she attended the Pacific Island Leaders Forum.A senior diplomatic figure familiar with the negotiations said while Clinton might have been keen, her government and the Australian government were not. “There were a lot of reservations and a lot of concerns about logistical capacity ... I recall a lot of dialogue between Washington and Canberra about it: can they really pull this off?”What is not in question is that the Papua New Guinean government wanted to host Apec.It was announced that PNG would host the summit in 2013, at a time the outlook for the country was bright, owing to a construction boom as a huge LNG project in the highlands of the country was being built.“GDP growth for that year in PNG was among the highest anywhere in the world, it was booming,” said Pryke.If PNG’s economy had followed the trajectory it seemed to be set on, then hosting Apec in 2018 could have been exactly what the country needed: a moment to announce itself on the world stage and an opportunity to promote private sector investment.However, just as the LNG facility was supposed to come online, the oil price plummeted. Since then a litany of problems have played out in the country, including an outbreak of polio, as well as sharp rises in the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis – and a struggling economy.Spending on Apec has been met with widespread anger across the country, culminating in Maserati-gate in October, after it was revealed the government had purchased 40 Maseratis and three luxury Bentleys for the summit. Diplomatic sources told Reuters that nearly all leaders attending the event would travel in special armoured vehicles, making it unclear what the sports cars will be used for.“There are a lot of people, not just in Port Moresby but around PNG who are outraged by the spending on Apec which seems to be extravagant,” said Martyn Namorong, a writer and activist in Port Moresby. “Many people feel it’s not been clearly articulated to them what the benefits of Apec will be.”The challenges of hosting Apec are significant. Alan Bollard, executive director of the Apec Secretariat estimates 5,000-7,000 people are expected to arrive in Port Moresby this week. Because of a lack of hotel rooms, the city has had to contract three cruise ships to be used as floating accommodation for media and other attendees.The US will be represented at the summit by Mike Pence who will not be staying in PNG, but will fly in from Cairns in Australia. He is the only leader confirmed not to be staying in PNG, but there are rumours other leaders may do the same.“It’s not a great look,” said Pryke of the US vice-president’s decision not to stay in the host country.While Pence’s short visit may offend, the fact that he, and not Donald Trump, is going to Apec is unlikely to ruffle feathers. “People are being fairly philosophical about it,” said Kemish. “It’s not the first time a US president hasn’t been to Apec. Pence actually has a bit of status around here, apparently he played a role in getting the old King James Bible into the country as a gift to the national parliament.”But the real love-fest of the summit is likely to be between PNG and China.“It’s already going to be the China show,” said Pryke. “Xi’s going for a long time … and he’s hosting a meeting with the Pacific Island leaders on the sideline of the leaders meeting and I imagine there will be a lot of big announcements – more investment, more aid.”China has already indicated its intentions to partner closely with the country, pledging to give the nation $3.94bn in aid and loan projects last year. This has concerned Australia, traditionally PNG’s closest partner. In the week before Apec, the Australian government announced AU$3bn in additional funding to the Pacific, which was widely seen as a move to counter China’s growing influence in the region.China provided significant infrastructure support to PNG ahead of Apec and Australia has contributed at least AU$130m, largely in the area of security. Diplomatic sources say this was something Australia was keen to do, particularly in order to keep the Chinese military out of PNG, which at its closest point is just 4km from Australia.Commentators are unanimous that for Apec to be a success requires more than just an incident-free summit.“PNG has an opportunity to drive forward a range of significant economic projects and send a message to the international investor community that it is competitive and truly part of the global community,” said Kemish.“There’s no turning back now, the toothpaste is out of the tube,” said Pryke. “It’s in everyone’s interests for this to be a success, however you want to define it, and also for it just to be done.

For one thing, British trees are rather complicated in their leaf-shedding habits and really vary according to location – autumn takes a while to arrive across the whole country.In the Scottish Highlands, for instance, the woods of the glens are already steeped in golden yellow as early as mid-September. Their canopies are also susceptible to immediate demolition should an early Atlantic storm pass through.In Derbyshire, many woods can often be cleared of vegetation by late October – yet, at the same date in Norfolk, which is more than 300 metres lower in altitude, there are oakwoods looking as emerald green as they did in midsummer. Come November, many trees seem to have barely cast a leaf.Another interesting thing about that leisurely autumn stroll is the environmental intensity that underpins it. Poet John Keats may have famously called it the “season of mists and mellow fruitfulness”, but it is anything but. What really drives those glorious colours in the trees is the stress of hard work.The element of almost all plants responsible for making summer so green is chlorophyll. But as well as being the miracle worker that turns sunlight to sugar during photosynthesis, chlorophyll is also a precious protein. Before they shed their leaves at the end of season, deciduous trees devote themselves to breaking it down and storing it away for another year.Sugar also plays a part in one of autumn’s most dramatic changes. It reacts with proteins in leaf cells to produce an antioxidant called anthocyanin. It is this red-pigmented agent that supplies the slow-burning glow of British woods. Ironically, the more stressed the trees are, the richer those reds seem to be. Autumn foliage is often more intense, for example, after sharp frosts.Of course, there’s more to the season’s full palate of colour. When you think of the lemon and burnt-biscuit fingers, say, of horse chestnuts, or the dull copper carpet that covers the floor of a December oakwood, those browns and yellows are what happens when a tree’s foliage loses all its chlorophyll.But what really makes autumn such a spectacle is that all these extraordinary colours occur together: so you might get the crimson of London planes colliding with the emerald of holly and ivy, or the scarlet berries of hawthorn and dog rose at the same time as the infinite earth tones of toadstools.Mushrooms may be the most modest player in this infinity of colour, but they supply the other great engine of autumnal change. It is the season when we get to see the extraordinary fruiting bodies, the so-called “toadstools” of fungi. It seems more than coincidence that these bizarre organisms are substantially made from the same stuff as insects – chitin – because, like insects, they have a gift for unexpected appearance. Suddenly they bulb up among tree roots, or emerge out of the heartwood like some chest-bursting creature from Ridley Scott’s Alien.These are the parts that digest the organism’s vegetable diet and then traffic it through the woodland floor. They also play a part in the development and maintenance of the canopy, because fungi in woods forge essential partnerships, whereby the roots of the trees interconnect with what are called mycorrhizal fungi. This link between trees and fungi enables them to share vital nutrients.In a single kilo of woodland soil there can be six miles of hyphae. Beneath an inidual wood, there will be many millions of miles of these fungal networks, and they are at the heart of the extraordinary demolition procedure that is at autumn.Without fungi, the world would be buried in this vegetable junk and life would stagnate for the lack of carbon dioxide.So next time you stroll along a woodland path in autumn with trees changing colour, remember that it’s these incredible underlying, unseen essentials that make everything around us possible."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684184.1541167032!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no more buck passing or dithering dublin needs a new boss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIllustration: Fuchsia MacAreeThere’s a classic trope in horror films where the protagonist sets aside the norms of rational behaviour and goes down into an unlit cellar, or gets into a car with an obviously unhinged stranger, while the audience can see the terrible event about to unfold and are willing the victim to retreat.It’s a feeling that will be familiar to any long-time observer of Dublin local authority proceedings. Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3694163.1541956162!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"%C3%A9amon de valera letter about end of ww1 made public","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDe Valera  wrote: “For the sake of the women of the world at any rate I am glad it is over. They it is who have suffered most. Their imaginings have been far worse than the worst horrors the men have had to endure.” Photograph: General Photographic AgencyGetty ImagesA letter written by Éamon de Valera from prison to his wife on Armistice Day has been made public for the first time. The letter is sent from Lincoln Jail where de Valera, who later became taoiseach and president, was incarcerated after the German Plot of May 1918 with many of the Sinn Féin leadership. They were arrested by the British authorities following a spurious rumour that they were conspiring with Germany. In the letter, de Valera says he can hear the “sirens and bells which announce that the armistice with Germany has been signed”. It led him to reflect on all the families who lost somebody in war and how the armistice would only deepen and accentuate the grief of those who had been bereaved. “How many homes will (sic) the joybells cease ringing will be plunged into a grief which at the moment is not felt but which will be crushing when those who remain return home and it is realised that those who have fallen will never return?” De Valera wrote. “The thoughts that occur to me here today would fill volumes—we have leisure for thought calm sober thought—thoughts on the vanities of men and of Empires—vanities which the lessons of this war will not dispel.”De Valera added: “For the sake of the women of the world at any rate I am glad it is over. They it is who have suffered most. Their imaginings have been far worse than the worst horrors the men have had to endure.”The letter was thought lost during a burglary at the gatelodge of the de Valera family home in Blackrock, Dublin in the late 1970s. It was the original home of Éamon and Sinead de Valera and at the time their eldest son, Vivion, was living there. Some time later it was sent anonymously to Vivion who was then the managing director of The Irish Press Group. It is now in the UCD Archives and appears as part of their online exhibition to mark Armistice Day. De Valera’s biographer, RTÉ journalist David McCullagh said the sentiments in the letter were similar to the ones De Valera expressed before he participated in the Easter Rising. At that time De Valera wrote: “We’ll be alright, it’s the women who will suffer. The worst they can do to us is kill us, but the women will have to remain behind to rear the children.” McCullagh, who has just produced the second volume of his biography entitled De Valera: Rule 1932-1975, said the letter also demonstrated as early as Armistice Day that de Valera feared the first World War would not be the “war to end all wars”. De Valera had been consistently against the Irish serving in the war and retained a neutral stance in the second World War. “Given his relative lack of political experience at this stage of his career, his remarks are quite perceptive,” McCullagh said. “It’s really interesting that even in 1918, even though he was in prison, he had this view of the potential pitfalls of a harsh peace.”I got your recent letters. I hope the children are now all well and that, as so often happens, when the strain was relaxed you did not yourself get the disease.I have just heard the sirens and bells which announce that the armistice with Germany has been signed.

Speaking in Paris where he attended Armistice commemorations, Leo Varadkar spoke of a contemporary challenge facing Europe and listed “the fact that for the first time a member state of the European Union is leaving” as one of the greatest threats to the continent and to Ireland. Asked if there was a danger that Arlene Foster’s Democratic Unionist Party would sabotage an agreement on an orderly Brexit, Mr Varadkar said, “There isn’t, nor should there be, any one political party anywhere in the UK or Europe that should have a veto on this.”The DUP “have influence”, Mr Varadkar acknowledged. But, he added, “Ultimately this will be a decision for the UK government and after that Westminster and the European Council.”He cast doubt on how representative the DUP is of wider opinion in Northern Ireland. “There are other political parties too,” he said. “I’m going to meet some of them next week. I think we should listen to the voices of business, of farmers, of trade unions, of citizens and NGOs.When you listen to Northern Ireland in the round, they see some sense and perhaps even some benefits for Northern Ireland” in a backstop that would keep the North in the single market.The DUP rejects the idea of a maritime border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, but it also rejects the idea of keeping the North in the single market. Were those demands incompatible with a Brexit agreement?That wasn’t Ireland’s problem, the Taoiseach replied.“It’s always important to go back to first principles and to bear in mind that the position of Ireland, and the Irish Government, has been that we don’t want any new borders,” he said.“We don’t want to put up any borders that ide us, North and South, east and west or across the European Union. It is Brexit, it is the decision of the UK to leave the EU, which we regret but respect, that has raised all these challenges.”Presidents Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump made European defence an issue this week, when Mr Macron called for the creation of a European army that could stand up to China, Russia and the US. Mr Trump called the statement “insulting”.“It is right that Europe should be more self-reliant for its own defence,” Mr Varadkar said. But Ireland was a neutral country. “We are not aligned. We are not going to join Nato. We are not going to join a European army.”Ireland would nonetheless contribute to Pesco, the EU’s Permanent Structured Co-operation defence framework, for example by combating cyber terrorism and international crime, Mr Varadkar said. The Taoiseach rejected the idea that participation in Pesco would raise Ireland’s defence budget to 2 per cent of gross domestic product.“That really is far off the mark,” he said. “We will be increasing our spending because we want to bring our defence forces up to full strength. We’ve a deal in place to increase pay for defence forces. We are also buying new equipment and I think that’s spending I can stand over.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph:  Government poolMaxwellsAt his inauguration for a second term on Sunday evening, President Michael D Higgins said “ideas matter” and “history tells us that anti-intellectualism” is “the weapon of authoritarian and anti-democratic forces in so many parts of our shared, vulnerable planet”.“Our choice must be to actively extend and deepen democracy, to express it in wider forms and in new ways,” he said.He said that not alone was “the very existence of our planet in its bioersity threatened, but we have not yet slowed the pace of that destruction.“We live with ongoing violence against women which must be ended.“We must confront and challenge any excuses offered for the denial of the irreducible rights of women, who make up, let us not forget, a majority of humanity on this planet. It is important that we recognise the rights and culture of indigenous peoples. It is also important that each person is free to express their sexuality, gender or relationship.”He was presented with his seal of office by Chief Justice Frank Clarke after taking the declaration of office at Dublin Castle.At the ceremony, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke of Mr Higgins’s overwhelming mandate and said we are fortunate to have somebody with the “values” and “sensitivity” of Mr Higgins, who “speaks for all parts of society”. He acknowledged the contribution of the President’s wife Sabina. Mr Varadkar also made reference to Mr Higgins’s dogs Brod and Sioda.Also in the audience for the ceremony at St Patrick’s Hall were presidential candidates Peter Casey, Joan Freeman, Liadh Ní Riada and Seán Gallagher Ministers Simon Coveney, Katherine Zappone, Simon Harris, Simon Coveney and Paschal Donohoe former presidents Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese, and former taoiseach Bertie Ahern.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris and dignitaries from more than 25 countries were also in attendance.The event started with an inter-faith service of prayer from Christian, Jewish and Islamic representatives, including Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin. This was followed by a reflection on behalf of the Humanist Association of Ireland.In 2011, Mr Higgins had become the first President of Ireland to include humanists in the official inauguration ceremony. The association has described the gesture of inclusion towards those of no religion as “very significant”.Among the musicians who performed at the event was Celine Byrne, who sang a song written by Seán Ó Riada, the father of Sinn Féin presidential candidate Liadh Ní Riada.Traditional Irish music was provided by Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh and the combined bands of the Defence Forces School of Music.The event was delayed by six hours so that Government Ministers could attend events in France commemorating the centenary of the first World War ending.The President’s guests at the inauguration ceremony were described as “children and adults from all walks of life”.As Mr Higgins left the hall for Dublin Castle’s Upper Yard he was greeted by about 70 children from schools across Ireland. He also inspected a guard of honour. The couple then held a reception in the State Apartments in Dublin Castle for a number of invited guests.Mr Higgins’s seven-year term had ended on Saturday, and he ceased to be head of State from midnight on November 10th. The Presidential Commission – made up of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad – stood in during the interregnum period.Mr Higgins wore a suit by Dublin-based tailor Declan Abrahams for the ceremony, while Sabina Higgins wore a dress and coat by Tipperary-born designer Louise Kennedy. She also wore a Kennedy coat and dress for the 2011 inauguration. At the State Apartments reception she was to wear a pink dress designed by Irish designer Heidi Higgins, a graduate of NCAD.It was originally planned that Mr Higgins would be inaugurated for his second term at midday on November 11th, but he asked that the ceremony be moved to facilitate those who wished to attend Armistice Day commemorations that morning.Earlier on Sunday he attended the Armistice Day centenary commemorations at Dublin’s Glasnevin Cemetery.Mr Higgins won the presidential election against five other candidates on October 26th with 56 per cent of first preference votes.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Dedicating himself to the building of “a real and beautiful Republic of inclusivity, creativity, imagination, love and indeed joy”, Michael D Higgins was inaugurated as President of Ireland for his second term at Dublin Castle on Sunday night.Referencing his campaign theme of “a real republic”, President Higgins said the people of Ireland had given “a huge mandate” to his vision in a speech that dwelled on international as much as national subjects.Although Mr Higgins’s speech concluded on an optimistic note, he also sent a message to the assembled political leaders, warning that “inequalities are deepening and many of our people do not have the necessary securities of adequate housing, shelter, health, education, such securities and supports which would allow them to realise their rights and participate with equality”.The President made and then signed the Declaration of Office at the invitation of the Chief Justice, Frank Clarke, in a ceremony in St Patrick’s Hall in Dublin Castle attended by members of the Government, the Oireachtas, the judiciary, the Council of State, senior civil servants, religious leaders, the diplomatic corps and invited guests.After the conclusion of the inauguration ceremony, the President was greeted by schoolchildren, and then inspected a Guard of Honour. He then left for Áras an Uachtaráin before returning in a ceremonial procession for a reception in the State Apartments at the Castle on Sunday night.Mr Higgins’s inauguration came three weeks after his overwhelming victory in the presidential election, which he won on the first count with 56 per cent of the vote. All the defeated candidates attended the Dublin Castle ceremony.In a speech that skirted broad political themes, Mr Higgins described a “real republic” as “a life lived together, one where there is a commitment to equality, to strong, sustainable communities, to the sharing of history and to shaping of the future together recognising our vulnerabilities, drawing on and enhancing our inidual and collective capacities.”He said achieving this goal required a “rigorous commitment to removing the many barriers to participation recognising, strengthening and supporting the momentum and demand for equality, positive transformation and sustainability.”Mr Higgins warned about climate change and global inequality, but said “the good news” was that “a rising generation” of Irish people was interesting in tackling them.He said there were “decencies lodged in the heart of our Irishness” but, after an election campaign which featured criticism of Travellers, Mr Higgins warned against “influences that may be dismissive of any responsibility towards the needs, opinions or experiences of others”.In perhaps the most proscriptive part of his speech, Mr Higgins said: “These are tendencies we must not allow to take root.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3694287.1541963790!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unity and disorder emanate from armistice commemoration in paris","story":"Some 70 world leaders gather at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris for a solemn ceremony to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of first World War. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS first lady Melania Trump and US president Donald Trump look on as  German chancellor Angela Merkel talks to French president Emmanuel Macron at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on November 11, 2018. Photograph:  François Mori This was the image that the world would remember, President Emmanuel Macron said: 84 heads of state and government and international organisations marching up the Champs-Élysée in the rain, some holding hands, to mark the centenary of the armistice that ended the first World War.“What remains uncertain is how this image will be interpreted in the future,” Macron said when he opened the Paris Peace Forum in the afternoon. “Will it be the bright symbol of a lasting peace between nations? Or, on the contrary, the photograph of a last moment of unity, before the world sank into a new disorder?”Three leaders refused to ride in the buses that ferried the world’s leaders from the Élysée Palace to within 50m of the Arc de Triomphe, ostensibly for security reasons: Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Binyamin Netanyahu. By arriving alone, they seemed to signal that they represented the new rogue states, who have no desire to sign up for Macron’s goody-goody peace team.The French are fascinated by everything about Trump, including the two “beasts”, one a decoy, which were flown from the US for his two-day visit to Paris. NBC television reported that the armoured black Cadillacs cost $1.5 million (€1.3 million) each, weigh nine tonnes and carry blood in the mini-bars, in case the US president needs a transfusion.On Saturday, the exhaust pipe of the “beast” filled the courtyard of the Élysée with choking white smoke when it came to fetch the Trumps from their lunch with the Macrons.On Sunday, Trump’s convoy headed up the Champs-Élysées before Macron and his guests. Three militants from the Femen organisation jumped over the railing and raced towards the vehicles. Two were arrested immediately. A third almost reached Trump’s Cadillac before she was wrestled away by gendarmes. The women wrote the words “Hypocrisy parade”, “Gangsta party” and “Fake peacemakers” on their bare breasts.Trump apparently waited in a side street until the other leaders were seated. In the meantime, the solemn, symbolic moment of the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, when the armistice entered into force, was missed. While church bells pealed, the world leaders were still making their way up the avenue in a bus.Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin made an entrance by being the last to arrive at the ceremony. Macron greeted the US president and first lady more coldly than in the past. Despite tension over Trump’s renunciation of a key arms control treaty, the American and Russian leaders shook hands warmly and appeared to agree to a later meeting with a thumbs-up.Trump showed no expression as he listened to a translation of Macron’s speech through an ear-piece. The US leader sat in the front row with his legs spread wide apart, wearing his sempiternal red tie and hunched over, elbows on his knees.Much of Macron’s speech was clearly aimed at Trump. In its most patriotic hours, Macron said, France believed in universal values “exactly the opposite of a people who consider only their own interests. For patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is the betrayal of patriotism. When one says, ‘Our interests first and the others don’t matter!’ one erases what is most precious in a nation . . . its moral values.”The moving ceremony balanced French pride, including two renditions of the Marseillaise and the regalia of the Republican Guards and the Saint-Cyr military academy, with a display of multiculturalism that also felt like a rebuke to Trump.Yo Yo Ma, the American cellist born in Paris of Chinese parents, sat beside the flame to the Unknown Soldier as he played Bach’s Sarabande from Cello Suite no. 5.Angélique Kidjo, a singer from Bénin, West Africa, wore a sumptuous blue and gold African gown and turban as she sang a song of gratitude titled Blewu in the Mina language. One wondered if the impassive Trump recalled his description of African nations as “shithole countries”.In another example of openness and tolerance, students from the suburb of Seine Saint Denis read texts written by American, Chinese, English, French and German people who were affected by the war, in the language in which they were written.After lunch at the Élysée Palace, most of Macron’s guests travelled to La Villette, in northern Paris, for the opening session of his first annual Peace Forum.Trump skipped the peace forum to travel to the US cemetery in Suresnes, west of Paris, where more than 1,500 American “Doughboys” from the first World War are buried. On Saturday, Trump had cancelled a trip to the cemetery at Belleau Wood, where marines fought a famous battle in 1918, because it was raining. A grandson of Winston Churchill said Trump was “pathetic” and unfit to represent the US."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3694191.1541958030!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cross party mps vow to block may proposals on brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom: “It must be capable for the United Kingdom to decide to leave that customs arrangement and it cannot be something the European Union can hold us to.” Photograph: Stefan RousseauPATheresa May’s hopes of winning parliamentary support for a Brexit deal dimmed further on Sunday with MPs from all sides threatening to vote against her proposals. European Union negotiators have told Britain there must be a breakthrough early this week on the issue of a backstop to guarantee no return to a hard border if a deal is to be agreed by the end of this month.Conservative Brexiteers and pro-Europeans are united in their opposition to Mrs May’s plan to keep the whole of the United Kingdom in a customs arrangement with the EU until a permanent solution to the Border is found. The DUP’s Sammy Wilson said on Sunday that his party will vote against a deal based on the current proposals and Labour ruled out supporting the prime minister’s plan.In a joint article in the Sunday  with leading Conservative Brexiteer Steve Baker, Mr Wilson said the current backstop proposal should be abandoned in favour of a standalone treaty on trade facilitation with Ireland.“The EU would have a mechanism within their existing law for ensuring the integrity of the single market under WTO rules or an FTA. The whole UK would leave together, into a situation of self-government.”Jo Johnson’s resignation as transport minister last Friday, when he described the Brexit negotiations as the worst example of British statecraft since the 1956 Suez crisis, has galvanised other Conservatives who want a second referendum. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared to rule out a second vote on Brexit in an interview with Der Spiegel on Saturday but shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told the BBC’s Andrew Marr on Sunday that the party could yet support another referendum.“If we don’t have a general election, which we think we should have, then yes of course all the options remain on the table and we would campaign for there to be a people’s vote but, you know, there are several stages before we get there,” she said.Among the issues that remain to be negotiated is the nature of a review mechanism that would determine when a backstop would end. The EU has rejected British proposals for a unilateral review mechanism and for independent arbitration but commons leader Andrea Leadsom said Britain must be able to leave when it chose.“It cannot be a decision that can be overturned by the EU, it must be capable for the United Kingdom to decide to leave that customs arrangement and it cannot be something the European Union can hold us to,” she told the BBC.“Frankly, it’s because that would be to then fail to fulfil on the will of the people expressed at the referendum and I very much doubt we’d get it through parliament.”Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested on Sunday that Britain could leave the EU without a deal but pay £20 billion to Brussels in return for a standstill transition period up to December 2020.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Nelson is clearly trying to commit fraud to win this election, that’s all this is. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority leader, said: They don’t want the votes counted. We Democrats, we want every single vote counted. That’s every American\u0027s right no matter who they vote for.We’re willing to abide by the outcome if every vote is counted and nothing is interfered with. We believe that Bill Nelson will be reelected senator if every vote is counted, and that’s what Trump and Scott are so scared of, he added in televised remarks.The development came as top Democrats called on U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to step aside from overseeing a special counsel probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.In a letter to the Justice Department\u0027s chief ethics officer, Mr Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, asked whether any attorneys at the Justice Department have advised Mr Whitaker to recuse himself and demanded details on any ethics guidance he had received.President Donald Trump ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign and replaced him with Mr Whitaker, Sessions\u0027 chief of staff, last week.Pneumonia could kill 11 million children by 2030, experts warn  Jeremy Hunt to confront Mohammed bin Salman over the death of Jamal Khashoggi Millennials will not stop to help people with medical

Last week, the Supreme Court acquitted her, and she secretly left her prison, causing violent protests from Islamists, who said she should be hanged for blasphemy. The Foreign Office has said that she is still in the country, meaning her life is at tremendous risk. Even the judges who allowed her release are in danger now, after an Islamist leader said all three “deserved to be killed”.Many of us will rightfully feel far...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

The party won power in 2015 and Poland has since become increasingly isolated in Europe amid accusations of a tilt towards authoritarian rule.Some marchers in Warsaw chanted: Away with the EU but there was no sign of white supremacist banners visible at last year\u0027s march.Government officials walked at a distance from the main marchers away from any overt displays of nationalism and they were kept separate by security forces.Thank you for coming here, for Poland, and for bringing the white and red (Polish) flag which saw our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers spill their blood, President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, said at the start of the march.The march marked the 100th anniversary of the reinstatement of Polish independence in 1918There is space for everyone under our flags, he said.Several hundred metres behind the government column, participants held banners saying God, Honour, Homeland and launched red flares.Some chanted: Pride, pride, national pride and Poland should be national not red or rainbow-coloured, in a reference to the red flag of the Soviet Union and the symbol of gay pride.Warsaw\u0027s city mayor sought to ban a far-right march held on Nov. 11 annually for almost a decade but a court overruled her.Poland\u0026#39s President Andrzej Duda speaks at the start of a massive march marking 100 years since Poland regained independence in WarsawThe government then agreed with organisers after last-minute talks to hold a joint event to mark a 100 years since Poland\u0027s 1918 declaration of independence after an 18th century partition by Russia, Austria and Germany.Last year, the annual far-right march was dotted with racist banners such as pure blood, clear mind and Europe will be white or uninhabited.Those slogans fuelled concern about the rise of xenophobia in Poland at a time when other European countries are also grappling with a resurgence of the far right.PiS says it rejects anti-Semitism and racism but critics accuse it of quietly siding with the far-right.Since its election in 2015, the party has seen Poland increasingly isolated in Europe amid accusations of a tilt towards authoritarian rule. It promises more Catholic values and patriotism in public life and more state say in the economy.The party taps into frustration with liberal values and anti-establishment sentiment that has galvanized far-right voters in other parts of Europe.Thousands of people walked in the annual March of Independence organized by far right activists Remember the shameful slogans of last year\u0027s Nov. 11 march?, centrist lawmaker Marcin Kierwinski said on Twitter on Saturday. A year later, their authors are meeting with the president and prime minister instead of a prosecutor.The United States embassy in Warsaw issued a security alert ahead of the march.Before the late-night agreement with the government on Friday to hold a joint event, organisers had said they expected the march to be the biggest far-right event in Europe in years.The organizers of the Independence March ... are great patriots. In our times, the youth wasn\u0027t this patriotic, said Teresa Radzikowska, a 70-year-old retiree from central Poland who attended the march.On Nov. 11 Poles commemorate the establishment of the second Polish republic in 1918 from territory seized by its eastern and Western neighbours in the 18th century, made possible by the defeat of Russia, Germany and Austria in World War One.Also on Sunday, world leaders gather in Paris to mark the end of the war.Pneumonia could kill 11 million children by 2030, experts warn  Jeremy Hunt to confront Mohammed bin Salman over the death of Jamal Khashoggi Millennials will not stop to help people with medical problems, survey by Parkinson\u0026#39s UK findsIsraeli forces \u0026#39kill Hamas commander during operation in Gaza\u0026#39New dementia test which could spot signs of disease 10 years before symptoms develop, created by UCLThe Little Drummer Girl, episode 3 recap: Semtex, stakeouts and staged murdersSteve McQueen’s Tate Britain project is based on another artist\u0026#39s idea, ex-British Council director claimsStrictly Come Dancing 2018, week 8 results: Danny John-Jules eliminated in wake of bullying allegationsEscape to the Chateau, episode 1 review: who else would take on such an impossible, exhausting task?Dynasties, episode 1 review: David Attenborough\u0026#39s new series is an extraordinary tale of nature’s power politicsFraudster fled UK after asking flying instructor to drop him off in France during lessonTheresa May\u0026#39s Brexit plans will leave Britain in \u0026#39captivity\u0026#39, Boris Johnson warns as he calls for a Cabinet mutinyComment: My brother is right – Mrs May\u0026#39s deal is the biggest statecraft failure since SuezRemembrance Sunday: Britain united as young and old stand in quiet contemplation to honour the fallenQueen and senior royals lead nation\u0026#39s tributes to war dead as Britain falls silent to mark Armistice Day centenary ​Florida begins vote recount as Democrats and Republicans exchange allegations of fraudJeremy Corbyn criticised for wearing \u0026#39scruffy\u0026#39 anorak to Armistice Day serviceLabour faces split over second referendum as Emily Thornberry undermines Jeremy CorbynWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prince charles lay remembrance sunday wreath ww1 cenotaph nation","story":"Armistice Day: the final day of the First World War, as it happened on November 11, 1918 Daniel Hannan: Though the way we remember World War One constantly changes, we mourn all the sameEleven soldiers who lost their lives on Armistice DayHow the Great War changed our nation foreverCharles Moore: Why Remembrance matters so muchLast Post plays at Ypres as veterans mark 100 years since the end of the First World War The Prince of Wales has led the nation in remembering those who gave their lives in the First World War as he laid the wreath at the Cenotaph.For the first time ever he was joined the German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, marking a historic act of reconciliation between the two nations.The Queen watched from the balcony of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office along with the Duchess of Cambridge and Duchess of Cornwall.Remembrance services have been taking place all over Britain and Europe, which is an hour ahead, to mark the Armistice that ended the hostilities 100 years ago.It is estimated that nine million military personnel were killed between July 28 1914 and November 11 1918.The Prince of Wales laying the wreath at the Cenotaph this morningThe armistice, which was signed by German and Allied generals at 5am GMT, came into effect six hours later at 11am.

Church bells across the UK remained restricted throughout the course of the war and only rang freely once Armistice was declared on November 11, 1918.  Experienced bell ringer Louise Booth shows the ropes to new recruit Leanne Masterdon, whose grandfather served in WW1At that moment, bells erupted spontaneously across the country, as an outpouring of relief that four years of war had come to an end.Battle\u0027s Over, a series of hundreds of local events to mark the centenary of the Armistice, will also take place on Sunday.Pipers will play, beacons will be lit and church bells will ring in all corners of the UK and around the world as communities pay tribute to the First World War fallen.Described as a nation\u0027s tribute, Battle\u0027s Over has been in the planning for four years and will see hundreds of locally-organised events mark the centenary.Director Danny Boyle is asking people to gather on beaches across the UK on November 11 and etch silhouettes in the sand remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict.Events will take place at low tide at a number of beaches, including Perranporth in Cornwall, Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, and St Ninian\u0027s beach in Shetland.The French President, Emmanuel Macron, led the ceremony in Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day.Around 70 world leaders were in attendance, including Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Angela Merkel, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Jean-Claude Juncker, for a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe.Trump and his wife Melania arrived in the French capital yesterday, and were greeted at the Elysee Palace in Paris by the French President and his wife Brigitte.The two leaders and their wives greet one another at the Elysee Palace on SaturdayMerkel will later give a speech at the Paris Peace Forum, which focuses on \u0027concrete initiatives to strengthen multilateral cooperation\u0027.Macron has spent the week visiting towns, cities and battlefield cites around northeast France to commemorate the anniversary. Earlier this week he hosted Theresa May in Thiepval the site bears the names of more than 72,000 members of the Armed Forces who died in battle.In her second wreath-laying ceremony of the day, she and Mr Macron placed a garland combining poppies and cornflower le bleuet, the two national emblems of remembrance for Britain and France.On it she left a card with an extract from poem A Soldier\u0027s Cemetery by Sergeant John William Streets which read: There lie the flower of youth, the men who scorn\u0027d to live (so died) when languished liberty.The Queen and President of Germany heard prayers for a time of harmony during a service at Westminster Abbey marking the centenary of the Armistice.President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the Queen were joined by the Prime Minister, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for the remembrance service.Dean of Westminster, Dr John Hall, prayed for a time when conflict was transformed into friendship and collaboration.The Queen, dressed in purple, and Mr Steinmeier watched as flowers were laid at the grave of The Unknown Warrior, later shaking hands at the end of the service.The Queen and President Steinmeier at the Westminster Abbey serviceIn his bidding, the dean said: Above all, in our remembrance and reflection, we hope for a time when aggression between peoples and nations is transformed into friendship and collaboration, when all may live side by side in mutual encouragement and harmony and the weapons of war are transformed into the instruments of peace.In an address, the Archbishop of Canterbury said: We look back at the ruins and find that they have been rebuilt.We look forward, in a very different world and society, however great the challenges, and see that through the faithfulness of God and our loving obedience, conflict has been transformed, and enemies reconciled, and that is hope for the world.The choir of Westminster Abbey sang throughout the service, and readings were delivered by Prince Charles, Theresa May, Sophie Okonedo and John Simm.Mr Steinmeier delivered his reading in German near to the end of the service.For almost 90 years, there were no bells ringing from St George’s Memorial Church in Ypres, reports James Crisp from Belgium.On the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War, they rang four times in memory of the fallen, with the help of  readers.The faces of men and women who served in the First World War were etched into the sands of beaches across the nation.The tribute was organised by film director Danny Boyle and saw volunteers working through the night to create the beautiful and haunting images.Here\u0027s our correspondent Guy Kelly\u0027s dispatch from Folkestone in Kent, where the face of war poet Wilfred Owen gradually disappeared with the the Sunny Sands tide, in which you can read about all the other servicemen and women commemorated in the project.Pages of the Sea puffA newly discovered ‘thankful  village’ today remembered its 15 First World War heroes and paid thanks to the fact that each one survived and returned home 100 years ago.The tiny close-knit village of Butterton, nestled in the Staffordshire Moorlands, is one of the few British communities which can commemorate the welcoming back of all its brave warriors, Tracey Kandohla writes.Locals packed picturesque St Bartholomew\u0027s Church for a special Remembrance Sunday service - where an aptly named Thankful Bell rung out in honour of villagers who served their country.The Butterton survivors of the First World WarNo war memorial has ever been erected so the focal point on the centenary of the Armistice was the church full to brimming with a 150-strong congregation.The village, with 250 inhabitants, is one of just 54 \u0027thankful villages\u0027 in England and Wales where no one who fought in the war passed away.It is also part of an even rarer group of 18 \u0027doubly thankful\u0027 villages which suffered no loses in both the First and Second World War. A further thirteen soldiers served against Hitler\u0027s forces and all of them came back.One single survivor from the second conflict Eddie Mollatt, who served with the Royal Naval Coastal Forces, is still alive today, aged 94, and living locally.There is no war memorial in Butterton, but this ceramic poppy was put up in 2006 as a focal point to remember the wars.He was unfortunately not well enough to attend the service but his nephew garage owner Tim Mollatt, 52,  was among the proud congregation and said: ‘He’d be really honoured to know we were thinking about him and all the survivors from the village of both wars.’Here\u0027s some moving quotes from some of those who survived the four year conflictThe end of the First World War | In the words of the survivorsResearch by Ancestry found that Durham was the hardest hit town in the First World War in terms of the proportion of the population who died.After cross-referencing war dead records with Census data the research found that 6,353 men from Durham died in the war - 7.7 per cent of the population.British troops in a captured German trench during the battle of the Somme 1916Derby, Dumfries, Lanark and Perth also made the top five in terms of hardest hit towns.At the opposite end of the scale there were some villages that lost nobody during the First World War.These so-called Thankful villages include Llanfihangel y Creuddyn near Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, and Herbrandston in Pembrokeshire, both of which lost nobody in either the first or second world wars.Services have been taking place across the country to commemorate those who never returned from the battlefields of France and elsewhere.Among them was a service at Christchurch Cathedral, Oxford, to honour the 239 Christchurch soldiers who fought in the First World War, writes Coran Elliott.The proceedings were accompanied by Christchurch Cathedral Choir and led by The Reverend Canon Andrew Studdert- Kennedy.Oxford resident Denise Walker, 80, was chose to lay a wreath of remembrance at the memorial of Christchurch Cathedral today.Congregants at the service at Christ Church cathedral in Oxford Mrs Walker whose grandfather lost and eye and an arm in the war describes the task as an ‘honour’.She said: “This is such a tremendous honour, I feel grateful to those thousands of men who gave their lives.“My grandfather lost an arm and an eye just weeks before the end of the war and he suffered with many problems after the war ended.“So, I want to pray for the people who have suffered through war and for those whose suffering may be on going.’’At midday today the air filled with the sound of tens of thousands of ringing of church bells across the country.The mass harmonious strains were the culmination of a year-long campaign, Ringing Remembers, that intended to commemorate the 1,400 bell ringers who died in First World War by recruiting the same number of new ringers. Led by community engagement organisation Big Ideas in partnership with the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, the British government and the German government, the campaign’s ambition was grand – especially with only 12 months to achieve it – but as the  can exclusively reveal today, the response has far surpassed expectations. This week, there were more than 2,400 new campanologists learning to ring bells, and over 3,000 total signups.The traditional march past the Cenotaph will be followed by the 10,000 strong ‘People’s Procession’ honouring those who served in the First World War. Many of those marching have descendants who fought in the war.Friends Lesley Swan and Alison Thornton have travelled from Aberdeen to honour their relatives. Swan, a 53-year-old former nursery teacher, has two great uncles who were both awarded the Victoria Cross (the highest award for gallantry). During the Battle of the Somme in 1916 her great uncle Albert Hill and his company officer found themselves surrounded by 20 German soldiers in a woods. Albert killed 18 with two grenades, captured two, and went on to rescue two men from no man’s land. Tragically on the same day of his heroic actions elsewhere on the Somme his brother Joseph was killed. In June 1918 Hill’ls other brother, Enoch, was also killed. The other family VC was awarded to Swan’s great uncle John Beeley in the Second World War.“It makes me so proud and honoured,” she says. “It is so moving to be here.”Alison Thornton, 58, is marching with her grandfather’s campaign medals pinned to her chest. A lieutenant with the 18thBattalion Durham Light Infantry, Hedworth Williamson Tait was just 19 when he lost his leg on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. He was rescued three days later lying in a shell hole in No Man’s Land with a belt wrapped around his thigh as a tourniquet.Despite his injury he transferred to the Balloon Corps for the duration of the war and was awarded the French Croix  de Guerre and Distinguished Flying Cross. “He died when I was 12 and I don’t remember him ever speaking about it,” Thornton recalls. “If he was here today, I would firstly like to say a very emotional thank you. And then to ask, how did it feel the night before they went over the top?” Big Ben\u0027s bell rung for the first time in almost a year to mark the start of the minute\u0027s silence at 11am.The monument\u0027s 15 ton-bell has remained silent since the scaffolding went up as part of its renovation works.Big Ben\u0026#39s bells rung today as it remains encased in scaffoldingBig Ben\u0027s bongs today also heralded the start of church bells ringing out across the nation to mark the end of the First World War 100 years ago today.A 94-year-old veteran attending the service at the Guildhall Square in Portsmouth today said it is \u0027essential\u0027 younger generations continue to remember the millions who died fighting in the two World Wars.Former sailor Frank Cole, served during World War Two and was part of the D-Day landings.Mr Cole, from East Molesey, Surrey, served on aircraft carrier HMS Audacity and has recently received a prestigious award from the French Embassy for his contribution in Normandy.He said: I was in command operations in the Royal Navy between 1941 and 1945.I served on the HMS Audacity in 1941, was part of the D-Day landings in 1944, and spent a year battling in Japan.My father was seriously injured during World War One and was put in a tent with some other soldiers who weren\u0027t expected to survive.One of the doctors checking on everyone told him he was going to survive - against the odds.“Then in World War Two I was on one of the landing craft in Normandy, I recently was awarded the Legion d\u0027Honneur by the French Embassy for my bravery on D-Day.I think it\u0027s really important that we continue to remember. It\u0027s been 100 years since my father served and 70 years since I served.But that doesn\u0027t mean we should stop remembering and thinking about the millions who sacrificed themselves fighting for us.It\u0027s essential that the younger generations are taught about the wars so it never happens again, and so they can remember their family members.I am honoured to be a part of the service today - it is always special when so many veterans are together in one place to remember our friends and family.Our correspondent James Crisp at the Menin Gate at Ypres, Belgium, captured the moment thousands of poppy petals were released as part of a poignant tribute at the site of one of the worst slaughters of the conflict.The President of Germany has made history today appearing at the Cenotaph.Following the Prince of Wales who laid a wreath on behalf of the Queen, Frank Walter-Steinmeier laid a wreath at the foot of the Cenotaph and stood with his head bowed.President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier lays a wreath during the remembrance service at the Cenotaph memorialHe is the first German dignitary invited to the Cenotaph and was watched by his wife Elke Budenbender who accompanied the Duchess of Sussex on the Foreign Office balcony.The Queen was accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge although the Duke of Edinburgh was absent having retired from official duties last year.The Duchess of Sussex watching the service at the Cenotaph from the balcony of the Foreign and Commonwealth OfficeJoe Shute, our correspondent at the Cenotaph, says: Having laid their wreaths the Royal Family has now departed and the march past the Cenotaph is about to commence.Among the charities involved in the march are the Children and Families of Far East Prisoners of War. Veterans attending the service of remembrance at the CenotaphPam Gillespie, of Harlow in Essex, is marching with her two daughters and nine-year-old grandson, Thomas, (among the youngest taking part) in memory of her father George Money, who was captured in Java in 1942 and spent three-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war, and her great uncle Thomas Smith, a Lance Corporal in the Lancashire Fusiliers who was killed at Gallipoli in April 1915.“He was 25 when he died,” she says. “I’ve got a photograph of him and looking at it you just think of the waste of life.  It must have been horrendous for him. The enemy just picked them off as they landed.”The Labour leader has drawn some criticism online for his sartorial choices at the ceremony today.Mr Corbyn was wearing a casual jacket and red tie for the service, which was picked up on by some people on Twitter.Jeremy Corbyn at the Cenotaph todaySome considered the choice was \u0027disrespectful\u0027 and suggested a black tie would have been more appropriate for the somber occasion.The Prince of Wales has laid his wreath at the Cenotaph as the Queen watched with the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall from the balcony of the Foreign and Commonwealth office.The Prince of Wales laying his wreath at the Cenotaph this morningFor the first time ever the Prince was accompanied by the German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, marking a historic act of reconciliation between the two nations, who also laid a wreath.Following the Prince wreath the nation\u0027s political leaders also laid wreaths at the Cenotaph, led by Prime Minster Theresa May, and then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and leader of the Liberal Democrats Vince Cable.Theresa May paying her respects at the CenotaphThe nation came to a standstill to remember the millions who fell and died on the First World War, which can to an end 100 years ago today.At the Cenotaph the firing of the guns by the King\u0027s Troop marked the end of the two minute\u0027s silence before the Last Post was played.A military band passes The Cenotaph during the annual Remembrance Sunday memorial on November 11, 2018 in London, England.It is estimated that nine million military personnel were killed between July 28 1914 and November 11 1918.This has just come in from our correspondent, Joe Shute, who is at the Cenotaph this morning: It is not just lost soldiers but lost regiments being remembered at the Cenotaph. The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers raised 52 battalions during the First World War but in 1968 the regiment was amalgamated into the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. A 40-strong contingent from the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (All Ranks) Club is among those taking part in the march. Captain Christopher Christopher Dorman-O’Gowan, 72, is marching in honour of his father Major General Eric Edward Dorman-Smith, who served with the 1stBattalion, Northumberland Fusiliers during the Great War and in June 1915 was awarded the Military Cross.Veteran soldiers march across Horse Guards Parade before attending a National Service of Remembrance at The Centoph in Westminster, LondonDorman-O’Gowan grew up with his father’s stories and hoped to follow him into the Northumberland Fusiliers but as a result of the amalgamation served with the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers instead.“He never had any criticism of the war,” he recalls. “He just said it was the moment in time they were in: infantry coming up against machine guns. “Today I think of him, my regiment, the men of Northumberland who served with him, and of a whole generation who bled so we would not be dominated by Germany. I think of those who gave their lives for this nation and served.”The service has begun at the Cenotaph with Elgar\u0027s Nimrod being played at the national memorial. The Prince of Wales is due to lead the nation\u0027s tributes to all those who have lost their lives in conflict on the centenary of the Armistice today.He will lay a wreath at the Cenotaph on behalf of his mother for the second year in a row while an equerry will lay a wreath on behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh.The Queen will watch the Whitehall service from the balcony of the nearby Foreign and Commonwealth Office.For the first time, a German leader will lay a wreath at the Cenotaph, with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier performing the duty on behalf of his nation in an historic act of reconciliation between the two countries.At 11, all the bells in Ypres rang out.

The former Royal Artillery Sergeant spent four years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp during the Second World War and suffered such severe malnutrition he was left blinded for life.Born in Teignmouth, Devon, he was three-years-old when his father William was killed at the Somme on September 4, 1918 and travels out every year to the Dernancourt Communal Cemetery in France to lay a poppy wreath at his grave.Mr Freer, 103, is set to march at the Cenotaph in London this Remembrance SundayFreer’s son, David, who is pushing his father’s wheelchair in the march, said: “When we go over to his grave in France we always leave him for a few moments to reflect and the tears come into his eyes. It is very emotional.”Freer, who is marching with the charity Blind Veterans UK, described being the oldest veteran to attend as a “huge honour”.The Armistice on 11 November 1918 caused the number of Great War deaths to plummet considerably, but as Britain marks the Armistice centenary it\u0027s important to remember that casualties still continued after this date.American troops cheer after hearing the news that the Armistice had been signed, meanwhile hundreds of solider continued to die on that dayDid you know that 861 people are recorded as having died on Armistice Day itself? The youngest of these was Private William Leet of the Royal Air Force who died aged 17 and whose memorial can be found in Sidcup, Kent. The last soldier killed before the Armistice took effect was Henry Gunther, an American who died at 10:59am on 11 November 1918.Crowds have been gathering around Whitehall since daybreak with a long queue stretching around Victoria Embankment to attend the commemorative service at the Cenotaph.Sean Wareing of Preston is one of those to bag an early spot on Whitehall by the statue of Field Marshal Earl Haigh,  commander-in-chief of the British Armies in France during the First World War.Wareing\u0027s grandfather, Thomas, served with the Royal North Lancashire Regiment and was awarded the Military Medal for actions at Passchendaele, helping to arrest 18 Germans. He was wounded in the battle and spent a year recovering. To mark the First World War centenary occasion, and to commemorate the dead, the  has been granted access to the Commonwealth War Grave Commission\u0027s database of graves.Here, you can search for a surname using our tool and find out information about the number of Commonwealth casualties who shared that name -  where they died, at what stage of the war and who their family were. The database itself is an incredible monument to the war dead and can offer fascinating (and sobering) insight into the identities of those who fought.More than 70 world leaders have started arriving at the Elysee Palace before going on to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe, at the top of the grand avenue of the Champs-Elysees. Shuttle buses will ferry them between the presidential palace and the Arc de Triomphe, except for Donald Trump who will be driven there in his limousine, “the Beast”, for security reasons.President Macron will make a speech, which his aides say will emphasise parallels between 1918 and 2018. The leaders,  including Mr Trump, Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin,  will then attend a luncheon at the Elysee Palace.German Chancellor Angela Merkel being greeted by French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron as she arrived at the Elysee Palace in Paris this morningIn the afternoon, many of them will attend an International Peace Forum, but Donald Trump, no fan of international organisations, will not attend.The meeting at the Musee d’Orsay art museum on the banks of the Seine is intended to stress multilateralism and the importance of international alliances in resolving conflicts. Instead, Mr Trump will visit an American military cemetery in Suresnes, in western Paris, and is to hold a press conference before flying home.However, rain is forecast, which may prompt the US president to cancel the cemetery visit. Yesterday he cancelled a visit to another American cemetery 50 miles from Paris because of the weather. About 10,000 soldiers and police will guard the ceremonies.Anti-Trump protesters are planning to demonstrate in the afternoon at Place de la République in central Paris, about three miles east of the Arc de Triomphe. Police will maintain tight security at the protest, which the authorities fear could be hijacked by violent groups.On a day that will see countless symbolic acts of public remembrance around the country, ‘Pages of the Sea’, a vast public art project curated by the Oscar-winning filmmaker Danny Boyle and commissioned by 14-18 Now, the UK art programme for the First World War centenary, sees 32 immense sand portraits depicting casualties from the conflict etched into the coastline of Britain and Ireland.Volunteers rake the sand as they draw depictions of those killed in WW1, part of Danny Boyle\u0026#39s Pages of The Sea celebrations, on Sunny Sands Beach in FolkestoneFrom St Ninian’s on Shetland to Porthcurno in Cornwall, the 30ft long images – each with a connection to the local area – are being drawn at low tide by teams of six to 10 artists delicately wielding garden rakes. Once completed around three hours later, crowds will have just moments to absorb the haunting faces of the fallen gazing back at them before they are reclaimed by the advancing tides.In Folkestone, Kent, where Boyle is in attendance to witness a larger, 60ft likeness of war poet Wilfred Owen carved into Sunny Sands, volunteers from the artistic collective Sand In Your Eye have been working under torchlight to lay out the portrait with LED markers. A small crowd of all ages has defied sea squalls and driving rain to witness the drawing, which is anticipated to be finished at 10.30am. At that point, they will be invited to create their own sand portraits using stencils. In advance of the tides turning, they will then have a fleeting moment to reflect on the Glorious Dead.Volunteers working on Pages of the Sea this morning Beaches are truly public spaces, where nobody rules other than the tide, Boyle said in advance of the day. They seem the perfect place to gather and say a final goodbye and thank you to those whose lives were taken or forever changed by the First World War.Please review our commenting policyPneumonia could kill 11 million children by 2030, experts warn  Jeremy Hunt to confront Mohammed bin Salman over the death of Jamal Khashoggi Millennials will not stop to help people with medical problems, survey by Parkinson\u0026#39s UK findsIsraeli forces \u0026#39kill Hamas commander during operation in Gaza\u0026#39New dementia test which could spot signs of disease 10 years before symptoms develop, created by UCLThe Little Drummer Girl, episode 3 recap: Semtex, stakeouts and staged murdersSteve McQueen’s Tate Britain project is based on another artist\u0026#39s idea, ex-British Council director claimsStrictly Come Dancing 2018, week 8 results: Danny John-Jules eliminated in wake of bullying allegationsEscape to the Chateau, episode 1 review: who else would take on such an impossible, exhausting task?Dynasties, episode 1 review: David Attenborough\u0026#39s new series is an extraordinary tale of nature’s power politicsFraudster fled UK after asking flying instructor to drop him off in France during lessonTheresa May\u0026#39s Brexit plans will leave Britain in \u0026#39captivity\u0026#39, Boris Johnson warns as he calls for a Cabinet mutinyComment: My brother is right – Mrs May\u0026#39s deal is the biggest statecraft failure since SuezRemembrance Sunday: Britain united as young and old stand in quiet contemplation to honour the fallenFlorida begins vote recount as Democrats and Republicans exchange allegations of fraudJeremy Corbyn criticised for wearing \u0026#39scruffy\u0026#39 anorak to Armistice Day serviceLabour faces split over second referendum as Emily Thornberry undermines Jeremy CorbynComment: Let\u0026#39s not forget the remarkable Great War stories that unfolded away from the battlefrontWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/11/TELEMMGLPICT000180643249_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"remembrance sunday britain united young old stand quiet contemplation","story":"Over 3,300 people wore coloured ponchos to create the shape of a poppy and leaf in Cirencester, GloucestershireBeneath rainwashed skies the nation gathered from early morning.

mcqueens tate britain project based another artists idea","story":"Steve McQueen wants to include photographs of every Year 3 pupil in London for a new project at Tate BritainSteve McQueen’s ambitious project to photograph every Year 3 pupil in London is based on the idea of another artist who started working in schools 14 years ago, a former British Council director has claimed.Andrea Rose has questioned the originality of the Academy Award winning film director\u0027s venture, in which he is hoping to create a single large-scale installation at Tate Britain using the faces of thousands of seven-year-old pupils.Ms Rose, who was the British Council\u0027s head of visual arts for 20 years before she stepped down in 2014, said that she thought that the idea was based on another project by Julian Germain. But the Tate dismissed Ms Rose\u0027s notion and insisted McQueen is making a very different piece of work.Mr Germain, who is based in Northumberland, said he started photographing schoolchildren in their classrooms as part of a project called “The Future Is Ours”, which he launched in 2004.McQueen announced the project in September Andrea Rose, the former director of visual arts at the British Council said: “When I read the Tate’s announcement it just seemed so obvious that it was very like Julian’s work in the area.“This is quite a specific project. I don’t want to take anything away from Steve, but I do think Julian was the first to come up with this idea.”Speaking to The , Mr Germain, 56 said that he finds the situation “uncomfortable”.“I first became aware of Steve’s project when I started getting emails saying “what the hell is this? And people getting angry on my behalf. “It’s not copyright infringement, it’s more that the conversations around it are pretty much identical. I don’t think Steve McQueen is familiar with my work, but a lot of people connected this project to my work.Andrea Rose said she thought another artist, Julian Germain, was the first to come up with the idea“I suppose my classroom project came first, so It is slightly uncomfortable for me. My project didn’t make it to London and didn’t really get noticed at a wider level, so now this McQueen project is being treated as a new concept when it’s not. Some of the essential ideas are the same.Speaking about his work, Mr Germain explained how his school portraits are very specific and shot using slow shutter speeds. “It’s not easy photographing them in the way that I do. It’s more like Victorian photography with a long shutter speed, than modern techniques.“Seaham was one of my first pieces. I was contacted by a creative agency for the project and I wanted it to be inclusive of every child and document the school environment at the same time.“It’s quite astonishing that these kids were five in 2004 and they will have left school by now. Indeed some of them may have children of their own.Steve McQueen (middle row, fifth left) said he wanted a portrait of all seven-year-old pupils like his own picture in 1977 at Little Ealing Primary School“In a book published in 2012, there were 65 of my school portraits in there, I also talked about all of the different possibilities that are in front of these people. In my archive I have 500 school portraits from 120 schools I visited. Some of them will turn out to be criminals, leaders, millionaires, happy people, sad people, there will be a whole spread in there.”In September, it was announced McQueen would co-ordinate a landmark project to photograph every seven-year-old in London for a Tate Britain installation, the gallery hoped it would help a whole new generation feel part of the art world.The project could include up to 115,000 children across London’s 2,410 primary schools.At the launch, McQueen said: “There’s an urgency to reflect on who we are and our future.”A joint statement from Artangel and Tate said: “Julian Germain made a very intriguing project. Steve McQueen is making a very different one now. Both projects involve portraits of children or students in classrooms, but that’s as far as the comparison goes. “The children in McQueen’s project are all at primary schools in a particular city, London they are all a particular age and in a particular class, year 3 and they are all being photographed in a particular way.”Steve McQueen could not be reached for comment.Pneumonia could kill 11 million children by 2030, experts warn  Jeremy Hunt to confront Mohammed bin Salman over the death of Jamal Khashoggi Millennials will not stop to help people with medical problems, survey by Parkinson\u0026#39s UK findsIsraeli forces \u0026#39kill Hamas commander during operation in Gaza\u0026#39New dementia test which could spot signs of disease 10 years before symptoms develop, created by UCLThe Little Drummer Girl, episode 3 recap: Semtex, stakeouts and staged murdersStrictly Come Dancing 2018, week 8 results: Danny John-Jules eliminated in wake of bullying allegationsEscape to the Chateau, episode 1 review: who else would take on such an impossible, exhausting task?Dynasties, episode 1 review: David Attenborough\u0026#39s new series is an extraordinary tale of nature’s power politicsFraudster fled UK after asking flying instructor to drop him off in France during lessonTheresa May\u0026#39s Brexit plans will leave Britain in \u0026#39captivity\u0026#39, Boris Johnson warns as he calls for a Cabinet mutinyComment: My brother is right – Mrs May\u0026#39s deal is the biggest statecraft failure since SuezRemembrance Sunday: Britain united as young and old stand in quiet contemplation to honour the fallenQueen and senior royals lead nation\u0026#39s tributes to war dead as Britain falls silent to mark Armistice Day centenary ​Florida begins vote recount as Democrats and Republicans exchange allegations of fraudJeremy Corbyn criticised for wearing \u0026#39scruffy\u0026#39 anorak to Armistice Day serviceLabour faces split over second referendum as Emily Thornberry undermines Jeremy CorbynComment: Let\u0026#39s not forget the remarkable Great War stories that unfolded away from the battlefrontWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/14/13/saver.jpg","title":"bank branch closures investigation treasury committee elderly vulnerable atms fca","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsProbe to\u0026nbspexamine whether vulnerable consumers pay more for financial services productsClick to followThe IndependentMPs will also evaluate the impact of reducing the number of free-to-use ATMs on vulnerable consumersAn inquiry into consumers\u0027 access to financial services has been launched by MPs amid concerns some vulnerable customers are finding it increasingly difficult.The Treasury Committee will scrutinise whether certain groups of people are excluded from obtaining a basic level of service from providers.It will also examine whether vulnerable consumers pay more for financial services products.\u0027Almost everything has changed in banking since the financial crisis\u0027Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Committee, said: “Vulnerability, as defined by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), is where someone who, due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to detriment, particularly when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care.“With customers expected to take more responsibility for their financial planning and resilience, bank branches closing and the number of free-to-use ATMs falling, it\u0027s becoming increasingly difficult for vulnerable customers to access certain financial services.“The committee will examine the practicality of the FCA\u0027s definition, the effectiveness of attempts by financial services providers to prevent increased financial exclusion and whether a premium is placed on products such as travel insurance for vulnerable consumers.“As part of this inquiry, we\u0027ll be holding sessions outside of Parliament to hear from vulnerable consumers who have interacted with financial services providers.”Bank branch closures reach ‘alarming’ rate of 60 per month Bank pairs bank branches with customer service. It worksEx-Barclays boss Antony Jenkins says bank branches will be blitzedQuestions the committee will consider include how financial services firms define vulnerability.It will look at the training in place at financial services firms in relation to vulnerable consumers and consider the merits of having a “duty of care” for financial services providers and examine whether this would increase protection for vulnerable customers.The committee will also examine which customers are most disadvantaged when bank branches close and consider whether there is evidence to suggest that bank branch closure leads to increased financial exclusion.It will also evaluate the impact of reducing the number of free-to-use ATMs on vulnerable consumers.Other aspects of financial services the inquiry will look at include how firms ensure their information is accessible to people with low literacy levels the use of the Post Office\u0027s services in areas where bank branches have closed the systems in place for power of attorney at financial services providers, and whether certain barriers which lead to people not having a bank account.The inquiry will also examine whether vulnerable consumers pay prohibitively more for certain financial services products, including travel and home insurance.The committee also wants to know how technological innovation could help those who cannot easily access physical financial services branches.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said. Whether bitcoin is the one, whether bitcoin has solved its speed problem, or it\u0027s another cryptocurrency, only time will tell.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

He later rescinded the claimOn 1 August, 2017, an unresolvable dispute within the bitcoin community saw the network split. The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet. On Tuesday, the company announced it would give away $125m-worth (£96m) of the Stellar cryptocurrency as part of a major initiative to encourage its use as a mainstream form of payment.Stellar is currently not even in the top five cryptocurrencies in terms of its total value, according to CoinMarketCap, but while it may be lesser-known, its backers say it is more technologically advanced and better suited to large-scale usage.\u0026nbspethereum cryptocurrency has a market cap of around $22\u0026nbspbillion (Getty Images)Another cryptocurrency that could see massive gains in the coming months, some experts say, is bitcoin\u0027s closest rival ethereum.

The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The European Commission – the heart of the Brussels empire, the “EUSSR”, – was always going to project a weak economic future for the UK post-Brexit, wasn’t it?A\u0026nbspgroup led by the malevolent Jean-Claude Juncker was\u0026nbspalways going to show the remaining 27 nations of the EU prospering while Britain, out of the club, stumbles helplessly.Such is the conspiratorial temper of our times that such reactions to the latest forecasts from the commission, showing precisely that, are sadly inevitable.UK set for weakest growth in Europe, European Commission warnsBut it’s still a silly conspiracy. For the commission’s forecasts for the UK are not, in fact, wildly different from those of others.The commission sees UK growth in 2019 of a paltry 1.2 per cent. The most recent average forecast from a range of UK forecasters – UK banks and economic consultancies – is growth of 1.4 per cent.That would leave us with faster projected growth than Italy – but still below every other EU economy.It’s true that the Office for Budget Responsibility in last week’s Budget projected growth of 1.6 per cent next year. But this was mainly due to the boost to demand from the chancellor’s extra spending on the health services and his income tax cuts. The OBR expects growth to fall back in 2020 to 1.4 per cent.The idea that the commission has produced some ridiculously pessimistic outlier forecasts for the UK doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.The commission thinks growth in the eurozone and the EU will slow down too in 2019, but not to the extent that it will in the UK.There’s another vital piece of context. The commission’s forecasts – like those of the OBR – are based on the presumption of a smooth Brexit next year, where we secure a withdrawal agreement and remain in the single market and customs union until the end of 2020.The weakness in almost all forecasts essentially reflects assumptions that the UK economy is slowing due to weakening household demand, feeble business investment and lacklustre exports.That may, or may not, be borne out.But in a sense it’s a red herring when thinking about the economics of Brexit.The really important forecasts to bear in mind are those of a severe economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit and long-term damage to our potential growth rate as a result of a Brexit in which we leave the single market and customs union.On this credible economists and forecasters are united.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Shoppers are increasingly staying home and ordering online“Help,” cried the retail industry.No wonder. Ten years ago this month Woolworths went pop. Dark clouds seem to have been bubbling and spitting over the high street ever since. That was underlined by a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the professional services firm, showing that a net 1,123 stores vanished from Britain’s top 500 high streets in the first six months of this year.\u0026nbspThe numbers probably won’t surprise anyone given the high-pocalypse we’ve witnessed among some of retail’s biggest names this year, including the likes of Toys ‘R’Us, Maplin, Poundworld and House of Fraser.\u0026nbspBritish high street is losing 14 shops a day, new research showsTowns with ‘unhealthy’ high streets have lower life expectancyWhy the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenHowever, closures have actually been outstripping new openings since 2010, and the gap is widening.Of course, the British Retail Consortium steamed in with a call for the government to take urgent action on business rates, beyond the tinkering contained in the chancellor’s recent budget.\u0026nbspThe levy is linked to property values and so hits bricks and mortar operators a lot harder than online outfits, which run their operations from out of town in places where you can buy land for a handful of coppers and a Mars bar.\u0026nbspIt has become the industry’s bête noire, and the trade body wouldn’t be doing its job if it didn’t make a fuss about it. But even if you completely eliminated it, the trend would likely continue, albeit perhaps at a slower rate.Britain\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspembraced internet shopping like almost no other nation, and that isn’t changing.\u0026nbspIt’s so much more convenient to have the retailer come to you\u0026nbspwhen the alternative is\u0026nbspslogging around the high street trailing children who’d rather be somewhere else and hoping you get finished\u0026nbspbefore the traffic wardens notice\u0026nbspyour car is illegally parked. Doubly so\u0026nbspif\u0026nbspyou’re time poor. Most Britons are. We\u0026nbspwork some of the longest hours in Europe.\u0026nbspPwC’s head of retail, Lisa Hooker, pointed out to me that 20 per cent of non food items are now bought online. The number is set to increase to 30 per cent by 2021. That says it all.So does this mean the high street is in terminal decline? Are the debates over its future worthless?\u0026nbspNot necessarily. Hooker made note of the fact that all the reliable surveys show that there is still a demand for bricks and mortar shops.\u0026nbspConsumers\u0026nbspjust use them less than they used to, and they want them to operate differently, alongside and as a complement\u0026nbspto their online excursions.\u0026nbspThat means the future will have to be made up of smaller premises that operate as mini showrooms, alongside “experience”\u0026nbspretailers such as vape shops and ice cream parlours, which have been doing well. As have\u0026nbsp(hooray!) book and record shops, which have been\u0026nbspmaking a come back.Encouraging short term “pop up”\u0026nbspstores to open temporarily\u0026nbspalongside them them could help\u0026nbspdraw people in.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471. Analysts put the dip partly down to the US federal reserve’s indication that it will hike rates in December, which strengthened the dollar. UK economy flatlines in September, official figures showEU heaps pressure on Theresa May ahead of crunch talksThe midterms have only given the US economy a short-term boostThe IFS is right – Philip Hammond took a big gamble with his BudgetHowever, UK economic data also had an impact, with the Office for National Statistics reporting that the economy stagnated in September. While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There\u0027s a notch at the top, but it\u0027s pretty minimal, like a drop of water when it\u0027s just about to gain enough critical mass to drip from the bathroom tap, no bigger than that. It looks cute.This teardrop notch is one obvious change. The second comes when you flip the phone over.

Pick up the phone and the fingerprint icon lights up on the dark screen. Touch it, and it responds with a neat animation, like a fizzing electrical sphere, and unlocks to the home screen. It feels like the future.Huawei has a similar technology, though a less glitzy special effect, on the Huawei Mate 20. Huawei\u0027s feels just that bit quicker, but this is far from slow. It\u0027s not as fast as a conventional fingerprint sensor, but at least there\u0027s the cute animation to entertain you –\u0026nbspand it\u0027s still only a fraction of a second.Also, it sits in just the perfect place, right at the bottom of the display, in the middle, while the Mate 20 Pro sensor is quite a bit higher.That other Chinese brand, Xiaomi, also has an in-screen fingerprint sensor on its new Mi 8 Pro handset, though that requires a little more pressure.Top tip: when you\u0027re enrolling your fingerprint, think about what angle you\u0027ll actually be unlocking it from. My vertical thumb print wasn\u0027t very effective. I registered it again coming at it from the angle that it turns out I would actually pick the phone up by and it worked like a dream.OnePlus has beaten smartphone heavyweights Apple and Samsung to introduce an in-screen fingerprint sensor (OnePlus)Overall, the fingerprint unlock is pretty reliable, though it doesn\u0027t work as consistently as, say, Face ID on the iPhone XS. But it does the job more than nine times out of ten, so enough to keep you coming back to it rather than turning to the other ways to unlock the phone, such as facial recognition (consistent but not as much fun) or tapping in a PIN code.When it unlocks, you get to see the display in all its glory. It covers 86 per cent of the front of the phone. You can even obscure the notch if you want, or at least set it so the display colours itself black on either side of it, so it blends in. But with such a pretty notch, why would you hide it? Well, only because it gives the screen a little more symmetry, near-matching bezels at top and bottom, it suddenly looks like.The 6.41-inch display on this phone is bright and colourful, looking eye-searingly vivid in some wallpapers (which I love the look of, by the way). The wallpapers even bear the OnePlus slogan of Never Settle, a reminder of the plucky Chinese brand\u0027s positive attitude.It\u0027s a pin-sharp OLED screen, with 401 pixels per inch, that\u0027s the same as the iPhone 8 Plus and rather more than the iPhone XR. And it has OnePlus specialities like reading mode which turns the screen monochrome as though it were a Kindle.\u0026nbspIt completely dominates the front of the phone and you\u0027ll be glad to know it\u0027s robust –\u0026nbspit\u0027s made of Gorilla Glass 6.OnePlus mobile phones are seen on display during a press briefing in Mumbai, India, July 31, 2018 (REUTERSFrancis Mascarenhas)As far as the rear of the phone is concerned, there are two finishes to choose from, Midnight Black (it means matte black) and Mirror Black (it means, oh, you can work it out). Both are attractive.One of the most interesting things about the design is what\u0027s not there:\u0026nbspThe headphone jack. OnePlus is hardly alone in dropping this connection but nonetheless it\u0027s something that many fans have not been happy about, not least because the company championed the headphone jack one the OnePlus 6. Mind you, it means the phone has a bigger battery than last time, which on balance, is a decent trade-off.OnePlus hasn\u0027t introduced waterproofing here, either, something which is a real boon in technology generally. So, don\u0027t drop it in the bath. And, be warned, this phone can feel slippy in the hand.Something else that\u0027s absent is wireless charging. Now, scores of phones have had this capability and until recently it\u0027s gone largely unused. But the truth is that wireless charging pads are an unsung hero of the tech world, providing a genuine improvement in convenience that, once used, is hard to give up on.Wireless charging is especially good at disguising limited battery life because the simplicity of putting it on a pad feels much less of a commitment than digging out the right cable and plugging it in.So, although the company hasn\u0027t ruled wireless charging out for future phones, it\u0027s a shame it\u0027s not here now. Especially as the rear of the phone is glass, not metal.\u0026nbspStill, OnePlus prides itself on charging the battery fast, and that\u0027s definitely the case with the OnePlus 6T, which quickly goes from empty to enough to get through a day in around half an hour. That\u0027s part of the argument against wireless charging, of course, that it\u0027s not as fast.Battery life is strong with a full charge leaving you with a third of a battery by the end of the day, often more. As mentioned, this battery is bigger than on the OnePlus 6.Performance is good, too, thanks to the fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip and plenty of RAM to keep everything speeding along. It has the latest version of Android on board, Android Pie 9.0. OnePlus uses its own Oxygen OS set-up which is accessible and attractive.The camera is a crucial element on every smartphone now and I found the OnePlus 6T camera to be a moderate improvement on the last model. The hardware is the same, but algorithms and software have been enhanced to better photograph faces, text, food and night scenes, OnePlus says.The front camera is high-resolution, 16MP, and has similarly had a software uptick to make selfies sharper.The rear camera hardware is good - a pair of sensors with 16MP and 20MP resolution respectively - but sometimes I found the images were low on detail in places. Low light was less of a problem than on many phones but I didn\u0027t feel the camera quite on the level of the best in the market, such as the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and iPhone XS. Then again, those phones cost a lot more.Which is a part of the story for OnePlus. Although the latest phone is not as super-cheap as its handsets were when it first arrived on the scene, the price ticket here, £499, is impressive. Especially since the storage on board is 128GB, where many rivals have 64GB as standard, still.Camera apart, there\u0027s not much you miss out on with this phone (well, wireless charging and a headphone jack but they aren\u0027t dealbreakers) and there are some elements, such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor, which hardly any other phones can match. Add to that the strong performance, great battery life and fast recharge, and the OnePlus 6T is a deeply appealing choice.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471. Analysts put the dip partly down to the US federal reserve’s indication that it will hike rates in December, which strengthened the dollar. UK economy flatlines in September, official figures showEU heaps pressure on Theresa May ahead of crunch talksThe midterms have only given the US economy a short-term boostThe IFS is right – Philip Hammond took a big gamble with his BudgetHowever, UK economic data also had an impact, with the Office for National Statistics reporting that the economy stagnated in September. While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Eventually we could even use the technology to navigate ourselves, as we\u0027re on a path towards miniaturising\u0026nbspit\u0026nbspto the point it could fit in a smartphone.minitiarisation has already begun that could eventually see one fit in a smartphone (Imperial College London)The device represents the UK\u0027s first commercially viable\u0026nbspquantum accelerometer, which is a far more advanced version of the sorts of accelerometers that currently exist in today\u0027s mobile phones and laptops.The idea of using accelerometers for navigating is not a new one – as they\u0026nbspmeasure\u0026nbsphow quickly the speed of an object is changing in time –\u0026nbspthough until now accelerometers have not been accurate enough to match other technologies like\u0026nbspGPS.The quantum accelerometer relies on the precision and accuracy made possible by measuring properties of super-cool atoms, which means any loss in accuracy is immeasurably small.Dr Joseph Cotter, from the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial, said: “When the atoms are ultra-cold we have to use quantum mechanics to describe how they move, and this allows us to make what we call an atom interferometer.”CenterHandout via REUTERS)Real-world applications for the device could first be seen in the shipping industry, as it offers a solution to some of the issues presented by GPS\u0026nbspnavigation.We need new types of navigation because at the moment the world relies very heavily on the global network of satellites to tell everybody where they are, said Professor Ed Hinds, director of the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial College London.Scientists teleport particle into space in major breakthroughIt\u0027s actually rather easy for that system to be emulated and in fact it\u0027s been estimated that the UK alone stands to lose about a billion pounds a day if the satellite navigation system were denied.GPS\u0026nbspemulation – or signal spoofing – can also put cargo ships at risk to piracy,\u0026nbspDr Malcolm said, with\u0026nbsppirates\u0026nbspknown to\u0026nbspspoof signals in order to lure high-value cargos to dangerous areas.This is just the start of the journey for quantum navigation, he said. Scientists like Heisenberg and Einstein described these quantum ideas in their theories, but it\u0027s taken until now to actually physically make them a reality.\u0026nbspThe step forward this kind of technology offers\u0026nbspis unbelievable. First there was analogue, then digital – the next great leap is quantum.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Animals treated in this manner, such as the unusual scarab mummies, are thought to have been used as religious offerings.Created with Sketch.Tombs of the pyramid builders discovered in Giza, Egypt Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)A couple of days ago, when we discovered those coffins, they were sealed coffins with drawings of scarabs.

If you try to buy more than the limited number, your booking may be cancelled without notice, meaning no-one gets to go.5) Get your friends to try too, but stay in contact in case you all succeed and end up with a bunch of tickets you didn’t want.

It was her training, her choreography that got me here.I can only look as good as her dancing and you know, she is great, and I hope that her career goes up and onwards as she deserves.Dowden added: Do you know Danny told me day one that he has been a frustrated song and dance man.And I just think it\u0027s lovely that the nation has been able to see your talent and to see you back out there performing again, so thank you for delivering such amazing performances week in, week out.

We are not going to accept an outline deal at all costs and we are still working on it.”Ministers are also demanding to see full legal advice on the power to be conceded over ending the backstop, after Ms May indicated only a legal summary would be made available.The continued turmoil burst out into the open when Ms Leadsom told BBC Radio 5 Live: “The UK cannot be held against its will in a customs arrangement.”The prime minister has urged her cabinet to abandon hopes of a unilateral power to end the backstop and push for a joint review mechanism with Brussels instead.But pro-Brexit Tories fear the UK will locked indefinitely into the customs union – unable to sign its own trade deals – unless it can end the backstop unilaterally, at some point soon after 2020.Ms Leadsom said: “It must be capable for the United Kingdom to decide to leave that customs arrangement and it cannot be something that the European Union can then hold us to.”And she warned: “It’s because that would be to then fail to fulfil on the will of the people expressed in the referendum and I very much doubt that we would get it through parliament.”Second cabinet minister rejects key part of May\u0027s Brexit planThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumPreparations made for hospital food shortages if no-deal BrexitEU leaders say key Brexit issues still not resolvedThe warning came days after Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, also insisted the power must rest with “the sovereign British government”.Ms Leadsom also rejected the idea of an independent body to review if an alternative solution has been found to avoid checks at the Irish border – something dependent on untested technology.However, she insisted she was not on the verge of resigning, saying: “I’m sticking in the government to make sure that’s where we get to in the end.”Crucially, the EU is believed to have rejected Britain’s proposal of independent arbitration over ending the backstop, insisting the European Court of Justice must make the decision.If the prime minister also makes that concession – after repeatedly ruling out ECJ jurisdiction – she would risk even greater opposition on the Tory benches.Ms Thornberry sought to calm Labour tensions by saying the party could still back a Final Say Brexit referendum, just a day after her leader rubbished the idea.The shadow foreign secretary said “all options remain on the table” if Labour fails to force a general election by voting against the deal, if there is one.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn has angered Labour MPs and supporters by arguing Brexit cannot be stopped – and by going on to reject the growing calls for a fresh public vote.But Ms Thornberry said: “If we don’t have a general election then, yes, of course all the options remain on the table and we would campaign for there to be a people’s vote –\u0026nbspbut there are several stages before we get that.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is simply no excuse – either for Labour as a whole, or for inidual Labour MPs – not to oppose this agenda and give the people a final say.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

The issue now has to be how we bring people together, bring people together around the principles of our economy, our rights and that we don\u0027t turn this country into some kind of offshore tax haven on the lines that Donald Trump might want us to.”On Friday, he told the German newspaper Der Spiegel: “We can\u0027t stop it.

How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?\u0026nbspBen Chu\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followIndy PoliticsFrench lessons? France has a 35-hour working week, implemented in 2000Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, has been making encouraging noises about the idea of a four-day working week for some months now.\u0026nbspAnd this week things seemed to move on a bit further for the opposition party as it was reported that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has spoken to the cross-bench peer Lord Skidelsky about the possibility of an inquiry into the topic.\u0026nbspBut what’s the argument for such a reform? How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?Why would we want to move to a four-day week?Many advocates cite greater work-life balance. Working one fewer day a week would free workers up to look after children, elderly parents or simply to have more leisure time.But Mr McDonnell has talked about the move in terms of productivity – or a worker’s output per hour.He argues that British workers work the longest hours in Europe and yet are among the least productive.Give workers four-day week and more pay, unions sayThe four-day week could transform our lives and our economy Schools consider four-day week in cost cutting driveThat’s\u0026nbspborne out by the data we have.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u0026nbspestimates that UK workers put in an average of 1,681 hours a year in 2017. That compared\u0026nbspwith 1,514 in France and 1,356 in Germany.\u0026nbspYet the Office for National Statistics calculates that GDP per worker in the UK is lower than both those countries.Labour’s lesson seems to be that one way to boosting our weak national productivity is actually to give people less time in the workplace to encourage them to work more efficiently while they are there.\u0026nbspWhile this might sound fanciful it’s not totally outlandish. One recent study from New Zealand showed that when workers moved to a four-day week at one firm their per-hour productivity did indeed rise.The argument is that a better work-life balance makes people more motivated, perhaps by reducing productivity-sapping illness and stress.How could it be implemented?This is a key question. For whatever the theoretical merits of a four-day week for productivity, ordering the entire economy to shift immediately to such a radically different working time structure would clearly be massively disruptive.Angela Merkel’s economic success may be more about luck than strategyEmployers would have to reconfigure shift patterns dramatically, in some cases having to hire many more workers. Think in particular of public services like schools and the health services. Think of the retail and transport sectors.\u0026nbspAlso, around 15 per cent of the UK workforce is now self-employed. It’s hard to see how the state could practically compel those 5\u0026nbspmillion self-employed workers to limit their working week to four days.One policy possibility\u0026nbspa Labour inquiry might consider is whether\u0026nbspto offer tax breaks or other kinds of support to firms that offer four-day working to employees, hoping that this could\u0026nbspencourage the practice to spread.What would be the impact on the economy?That would depend to a large degree on those productivity effects.\u0026nbspThe size of the economy is the value of the output of goods and services produced over a certain period. Working fewer hours would, as a first order effect, seem likely to reduce the volume of those goods and services, thus contracting the economy.\u0026nbspBut if we could produce more of that output in a given period that negative impact would be mitigated, perhaps even wiped out altogether.And\u0026nbspeconomies are dynamic too.\u0026nbspIf we could increase our productivity\u0026nbspgrowth rate\u0026nbspthrough a shorter working week the economy could, theoretically, be larger over the long run.\u0026nbspCritics argue that the productivity impacts are unproven, and that France, with its 35-hour week, has higher unemployment and a more rigid labour market than the UK, something that seems to be particularly unfair on young people.Yet it’s also worth noting that in the late 1900s UK workers put in on average more than 2500 hours a year, almost 50 per cent more than today. But our economy is far larger than it was then due to productivity growth.\u0026nbspThe big-picture historical lesson is that it’s certainly not impossible for average living standards to rise even as average hours worked falls.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It uses the Snapdragon 845 processor and runs on a customised version of Google\u0027s Android operating system.All are features found on rival high-end phones that can cost more than £700, but Xiaomi is to sell the Mi 8 Pro starting at £499, as part of a strategy it calls honest pricing.Xiaomi opens Mi Stores in UK and USWang Xiang, the firm\u0027s senior vice president, said: Today we witness a new chapter in Xiaomi\u0027s global expansion journey, underpinned by our global ambitions.We are thrilled to make great strides by announcing our arrival in the UK.By bringing a range of our amazing products at honest pricing we want to offer more choices and let everyone in the UK enjoy a connected simple life through our innovative technology.The company will face stiff competition to establish itself in a crowded market, with three new iPhones, two Google Pixel 3 handsets and devices from Samsung, Sony and fellow Chinese firms Huawei and OnePlus being released in recent months.As well as the Pro, Xiaomi will also launch its budget Redmi 6A device for £99, which it claims has a battery that can last for up to 19 days.The Chinese firm is also bringing a range of its other gadgets to the UK, including its Band 3 wearable fitness tracker and an electric scooter.These products will go on sale in a physical Xiaomi Mi store, which will open at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd\u0027s Bush, London, on November 18.Mobiles expert Ru Bhikha said the firm\u0027s arrival in the UK should be taken seriously.Since releasing its first smartphone in August 2011, Xiaomi has rapidly gained a strong foothold in the market - so much so that it\u0027s already the fourth largest handset manufacturer in the world, he said.Xiaomi\u0027s highly anticipated arrival in the UK therefore threatens to put a big cat amongst the pigeons - by combining top tier design and performance with relatively modest pricing, it poses a real threat to the market.Looking at Xiaomi\u0027s success so far, it\u0027s hard to see how its winning combination of high-end smartphones with lower-than-expected prices won\u0027t drive similar results over here.Thursday\u0027s launch marks the arrival of a significant new kid on the block, and there is no doubt that in finally coming to the UK, Xiaomi means business.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It travelled without lights and with the windows shuttered, its passengers a handful of German senior military officers and politicians led by Matthias Erzberger, a moderate who had become a vocal advocate for peace. Their mission: to negotiate an end to the bloodiest conflict in the history of the world.                The Cenotaph is a place of hope for global peace, says LORD ASHCROFT                Our debt to the heroes who fought for freedom - EXPRESS COMMENTWaiting for them in a hidden siding at Rethondes in the forest of Compi\u0026egravegne, was a delegation of Allied dignitaries including the British First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Rosslyn Wemyss and headed by the commander-in-chief of the Allied armies, Marshal Ferdinand Foch.As the two carriages pulled up alongside each other, no time was wasted. Erzberger and the Germans, exhausted after their long journey, disembarked and made their way to Foch\u0027s wagon, ready to hammer out a deal.Ask these gentlemen what they want, said Foch to his interpreter. When Erzberger replied that he had come to hear Armistice proposals, Foch\u0027s answer was devastating: I have no proposals to make.The Germans tried again. Count Alfred von Oberndorff from the German foreign ministry pitched in. His delegation, he said, were seeking the conditions for the Armistice.Foch\u0027s answer: I have no conditions to offer.The German Fleet scuttled at Scapa Flow (Image: PopperfotoGetty Images)Admiral Ludwig von Reuter gave the order to scuttle the entire German fleet (Image: ullstein bild via Getty Images)The negotiations were not to be negotiations at all. Erzberger and his delegation had not been summoned to the forest of Compi\u0026egravegne to hammer out a deal - they were there to take whatever terms the Allies imposed upon them. And after four years and three months of a war that had brought Germany to its knees, they had no choice but to accept.By November 1918 the army was close to collapse, civilians were starving and Berlin was on the brink of revolution.The following day, the Kaiser abdicated and on November 10 Erzberger received orders from the commander of the German military, Paul von Hindenburg, to sign whatever was put in front of him.At 5.12am on November 11 in Marshall Foch\u0027s railway carriage, the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits No 2419, he did just that, with both sides agreeing that for the sake of tidiness, the ceasefire would not actually come into effect until 11am the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.Foch refused to even shake hands with his German counterparts afterwards. Eh bien, m\u0026eacutessieurs, c\u0027est fini. Allez, he said. Well, gentlemen, it\u0027s finished. Go.Whether it really was finished, however, is debatable. In the five hours and 48 minutes between the signing of the Armistice and the silencing of the guns, some 2,738 men on both sides were killed in the name of tidiness.                Incredible WW1 recording reveals moment guns fell silent in 1918                Tiny Kent village knits 8,000 poppies for POIGNANT WW1 displayEconomic collapse made many Germans bitter and resentful (Image: UIG via Getty Images)And if the Armistice of November 11, 1918, formally ended fighting on land, sea and air, bringing to a close a slaughter that had lasted four years and claimed some 19 million lives, it also set in motion a chain of events and consequences that would arguably have even worse repercussions for mankind.The Germans may have had no choice but to agree to whatever the Allies demanded of them, but the 34 clauses of the Armistice contained some stipulations that served to foster intense resentment across all German society.The nation was to be completely demilitarised, with all aircraft, artillery and even machine guns handed over to the Allies. Their submarines were to be surrendered within 14 days and the rest of the navy interned within the week. All captured territory was to be vacated and the Rhineland occupied by American, Belgian, British and French forces.BUT THE real bitterness came with the official signing of the full peace agreement in Paris the following June. The Treaty of Versailles, as well as maintaining all the terms laid out in the Armistice agreement, also insisted that Germany was to accept the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage during the war, as well as requiring the nation to pay reparations to the Allies, to the tune of some 132 billion marks (around \u0026pound284billion today).In Britain and France the end of the war may have brought about wild celebrations, but in Germany, many felt betrayed. And just a week before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, in the sea off the Orkney Isles, that resentment was made clear in spectacular style.The Treaty of Versailles required Germany to pay \u0026pound284billion in reparations following the Armistice (Image: Culture ClubGetty Images)French general Ferdinand Foch (Image: FPGArchive PhotosGetty Images)Vice-Chancellor of Germany under the Weimar Republic, Matthias Erzberger (Image: Hulton ArchiveGetty Images)On November 12, the German navy was commanded to sail the entire High Seas Fleet to the waters of Scapa Flow in northern Scotland, where they would be left with a skeleton crew and interned under the command of the Royal Navy.Eleven battleships, five battlecruisers, eight cruisers and 50 destroyers were moored at Scapa Flow, guarded by just three British destroyers. As morale among the German sailors began to worsen in the following months, the Allies argued over what should happen to the fleet: both the French and the Italians each wanted a quarter of the German ships for themselves.For commander Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, seeing his navy ided up among his erstwhile enemies was a humiliation too far. On June 21, 1919, against the strict terms of the Armistice, he gave the order to scuttle the entire fleet.Seacocks and flood valves were opened, water pipes smashed, portholes loosened, valves, doors and covers left open and over seven hours and despite the efforts of the Royal Navy to save what ships they could, 52 German ships were sunk, including all the battlecruisers and all but one of the battleships.While the Allies were furious at the flagrant breaking of the Armistice, many Germans saw the scuttling of the High Seas Fleet as a reassertion of national pride. German Admiral Reinhard Scheer declared: I rejoice. The stain of surrender has been wiped from the escutcheon of the German Fleet.The sinking of these ships has proved that the spirit of the fleet is not dead. This last act is true to the best traditions of the German Navy.Stereoscopic slides documenting life on the Western front during WW1 have now come to light 100 years on.                    H.Aldridge\u0026ampSonsBNPS1 of 17A group of British Tommies looking down at the impression left in the grass made by the unfortunate airmenHe was not alone in considering the Armistice a stain and a surrender - and even some of the Allies feared the terms were too harsh. Among them was the economist John Maynard Keynes: in 1919 he published The Economic Consequences Of The Peace, in which he predicted the reparations and punitive terms imposed on Germany would lead to the financial collapse of the country, leaving it ripe for a new kind of dictator.The horrors of the later German war will fade into nothing, he predicted, and will destroy, whoever is victor, the civilisation and progress of our generation.On June 28, 1919, seven months after the secret meeting in the railway sidings at Rethondes, the Treaty of Versailles was signed. Even as the ink was drying, Marshall Foch, the man who had first dictated terms to his German counterparts, declared: This is not a peace. It is an armistice for 20 years.It was to be a telling prophecy. In the decades following the treaty, Adolf Hitler exploited both Germany\u0027s economic collapse and its bitterness at the harshness of the Allies\u0027 terms, to build his own power base.EXACTLY 20 years later the world was once again at war. And on June 22, 1940, another Armistice was signed, with France this time capitulating to the German army. The location of that signing ceremony? The Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits No 2419 in the forest of Compi\u0026egravegne: exactly the same railway carriage where Erzberger had signed the 1918 Armistice - and for Adolf Hitler, the ultimate revenge.Assassination to Armistice: The war in picturesThe assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on June 28, 1914 (Image: Photo12UIG via Getty Images)A crowd of young men queuing up at the Army Recruiting Office at Southwark Hall (Image: Topical Press AgencyGetty Images)A soldier saying goodbye to a loved one in the rain at Victoria station, London (Image: Topical Press AgencyGetty Images)An American soldier lies dead, tangled in the barbed wire, Northern Europe, WWI (Image: American StockGetty Images)Crowds celebrating the end of the First World War (Image: The Royal Photographic Society CollectionNational Science and Media MuseumSSPLGetty Images)A German cavalryman wearing a mask to protect against gas attacks (Image: Topical Press AgencyGetty Images)How we covered key events during the warOur sister paper the  - founded in 1900, 18 years before the Sunday Express, by Sir Arthur Pearson with the axiom \u0027Never forget the cabman\u0027s wife\u0027 - took a fiercely patriotic line on the war and carried a regular recruitment advert for the ForcesOur sister paper the  took a patriotic line on the war (Image: )The newspaper carried a regular recruitment advert for the Forces (Image: )The newspaper was founded in 1900 by Sir Arthur Pearson (Image: )Germany\u0027s surrender and the end of the war captured in great detail (Image: )Gains in the Somme battle, a Zeppelin downed, and the death of military legend Lord Roberts (Image: )The deaths of Archduke Ferdinand and his wife led to the Great War (Image: )The work of 14-18 NOW is made possible thanks to funding raised by National Lottery players            "},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/183x122/1043724_1.jpg","title":"Brexit news update UK EU customs union backstop Andrea Leadsom latest","story":"Speaking to BBC Radio 5\u0027s John Pienaar, the House of Commons leader claimed MPs would never support a scenario in which the UK could not decide to leave a post-Brexit customs union arrangement.

After the fighting we came back and had to break his legs to straighten him out.October 26: Find shelter in doctor\u0027s home. French woman takes one look at us and shouts Les soldats Anglais arrive, les soldats Anglais.After a few minutes she brought wine and biscuits and we went into the cellar where there was another girl, 19, very attractive, a little girl of 12 and two other women.We said we had Jerry on the run and the doctor produced a map and we showed them. They said we were the first English soldiers they\u0027d seen since the retreat from Mons. Giles started to play ragtime on the piano.NOVEMBER\u0026nbspBerlaimiont: Orders to take three men and est ourselves of all identifiers - shoulder straps, pay books, everything except neck bars. We could keep 20 rounds of live ammunition and a mills bomb in each pocket. Orders to get ourselves through village and into Mormal forest and report. Pincher saved us from German machine guns by going alone.November 11: Smoke from Berlaimiont where Germans set fire to railway sidings. We dug into a field, and knew we were in for a savage attack.At 2am we got the order Come on, out you go, quick march, we\u0027re going back. We had no idea there had been an Armistice. We bagged a small cottage and scrounged some coal. Nothing to do but clean our buttons.Pincher came and I never saw a man look so despondent. I ask What\u0027s the matter with you and he said: Well, the bloody war is over and don\u0027t you young buggers think you\u0027re going home tomorrow. Our spirits soared.A little later I realise Pincher had been fighting for four years and he\u0027d got used to the way of life. His whole world had changed. No celebration, No flowers or anyone saying thank you. Just orders to go back to Englefontaine.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------An illustration of how soldiers felt to be tended by Nurse Gertrude MorrisPRECIOUS OBJECT... Margaret Whitaker, left, with the scrapbook of Nurse Morris  (Image: Roger MoodyGuzelian)Little is known of Gertrude Charlotte Muriel Morris, the socialite daughter of a wealthy vicar and JP who volunteered to tend wounded soldiers in Rouen and Le Touquet, western France, at the height of the Great War.Like Agatha Christie and other women of privileged class, she joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment, despite having little nursing training.She was decorated for her service, but it is her decision while in France to buy a leather bound scrap book which has provided a lasting legacy of her time at the front.Every soldier she treated between 1915-17 was enticed to contribute an illustration, poem, or some remarks about their stay.The scrapbook is packed with illustrations depicting life during WWI (Image: Roger MoodyGuzelian)The illustrations were collected by Nurse Morris at the Red Cross Hospital (Image: Roger MoodyGuzelian)Some, such as Sgt C Barnes, of the Sherwood Foresters, wrote evocative poems of the Red, red road to Hooge, the village that featured heavily in two battles of Ypres.Lt JB Wood, of the Gordon Highlanders, teased about Nurse Morris\u0027s inability to make decent porridge with a poem based on Robert Burns\u0027 The Selkirk Grace.Most striking of all are the beautiful illustrations, such as the self -portrait by Capt FT Sanders of him being treated by three nurses.Another, by South African 2nd Lt WH Kirby shows the officer in bed smoking his pipe, while Nurse Morris reprimands Just look at this mess.The album was passed to another nurse after Ms Morris died, aged 93, in 1979.Margaret Whitaker, 90, from Ripon, North Yorkshire said: It\u0027s an outstanding autograph book, as Nurse Morris called it - a precious record of those years.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------How Kate\u0027s greatgrandmother lied to serve as nurseKate Middleton\u0027s great grandmother Olive, far right, in her Red Cross nursing uniform (Image: nc)Baroness Airedale wearing a crown at the 1911 coronation of King George V (Image: nc)The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s greatgrandmother, Olive Middleton, lied about her marital status so she could volunteer as a forces nurse in the First World War.Civilian women wanting to play their part in the Voluntary Aid Detachment needed to be unmarried or widowed.So in her application Olive ticked Miss as her marital status - despite having wed Richard Middleton the year before.In a photograph from the time Olive is seen sitting with colleagues at Yorkshire\u0027s Gledhow Hall, which belonged to her cousin, the Baroness Airedale. It was used to station VAD nurses.History teacher Michael Reed, from Melbourne, Australia, said: The Australian grandson of Baroness Airedale gave me a photo of Kate Middleton\u0027s greatgrandmother, Olive, in her Red Cross nursing uniform in 1915. She was from a wealthy family and wanted to help. Tragically, her three brothers died during the war.Olive\u0027s caring nature, he added, was very much like Lady Diana, Prince William\u0027s mother.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Army calls up more Muslim recruitsThe Army has launched a campaign to recruit more Muslims as the nation remembers the sacrifices of 74,000 Indian soldiers killed during the First World War, writes Marco Giannangeli.More than 1.3 million Indian soldiers - including 400,000 Muslims - fought in Africa between 1914-18 as part of the British Expeditionary Force.In 1914 Sepoy Khudadad Khan was the first South Asian to win the Victoria Cross after staying at his machine gun after every member of his unit had been killed.Today\u0027s 70,000-strong British Army contains just 370 Muslims, a much smaller proportion than Muslims in society.Major Naveed Muhammad of the Armed Forces Muslim Association, said: While most people are aware of the contribution made by Commonwealth troops from New Zealand and Australia only 22 per cent of people know about the contribution by 1.3 million Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus who fought as part of a then unified India during the First World War.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u0027Just everlasting peace\u0027... a hero\u0027s Armistice letterWe ceased fighting today and I have seen the last shot fired. A thing I never dreamt was possible in my wildest dreams.To have come through four years of this seething mass of horror and death is a truly wonderful thing and one for which no human thankfulness can be adequate.These poignant words were written from Belgium by Lieutenant Colonel William Murray to his father on November 11 1918, where he was commanding the 15th Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery.Lt Col William Murray\u0026rsquos poignant letters home to his father and sister were published after the war (Image: Sophie Goodfellow)The decorated war hero from Armathwaite, Cumbria, wrote moving letters to his sister Claudine and his father, which were published after the war as a collection, Thunder Of Guns.His last letter from the front said: No more danger no more wars and no more mud and misery. Just everlasting peace it is a great world.Historian David Hargreaves, who has written a weekly Great War essay for the past four years, said: It embraces relief and incredulity, and doesn\u0027t sidestep the aching sorrow. Mr Hargreaves\u0027s essays can be read at centuryjournal.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Time to honour hero glider pilotsA new roll of honour has been launched to commemorate the 560 glider pilots who died facing some of the fiercest opposition during the Second World War.Around 2,000 so-called Total Soldiers took part in key operations including the invasion of Sicily, Pegasus Bridge on D-Day and Arnhem where they flew gliders carrying troops, jeeps, artillery pieces and even tanks. After landing, pilots continued to fight alongside their comrades. Details of the new roll of honour can be found on the Glider Pilot Regiment Society website.

Mr Hinds wants to halve this by 2028.The Government has been working with experts including Save The Children to develop easy, everyday activities for all families, from playing with numbers to songs and poems.Mr Hinds said: As the majority of children\u0027s time is at home, we need to think about how we support parents with learning in the home.Working with businesses and organisations we are looking to support parents with practical help and advice. This includes the development of a set of easy, everyday activities for all families, from playing with numbers to songs and poems, to support children\u0027s development.

Should parents be worried  Absolutely, say the experts.The National Crime Agency estimates that about , people in the UK pose a threat of some kind to children online — and the number is rising all the time.It adds there has been a  per cent increase in the referrals it has received about people uploading images of child sexual abuse since .Just as alarming is the damaging effect that smartphones and social media have on children’s mental health.According to Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University, the number of US teens who took their own lives increased by  per cent between  and .And , like me, you have a teenage daughter there is even more reason to be worried.Compared to the early s, nearly twice as many American teenage girls now end their own lives. In the UK, a quarter of -year-old girls experienced signs of depression, according to a study of , young people.Overall, Professor Twenge found that the generation she calls “iGen” — those born after  — are much more likely  to suffer from mental health issues than their millennial predecessors.“What happened that so many more teens, in such a short period of time, would feel depressed, attempt ­suicide and commit suicide ” she asks. “The sudden rise of the smartphone.”If you’re not convinced by the advice of the experts, just look at the behaviour of the people who’ve made their fortunes from peddling this digital crack cocaine.Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, stopped his children from owning a phone until they were  and the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, would not let his kids play on iPads — even though he invented them.Apple recently introduced a new update that tells you how much time you are spending on your screen each day.That’s a step in the right direction, but don’t expect the company to do too much more. Last year, Apple sold nearly a quarter of a billion iPhones, helping to make it the world’s most valuable brand.The leaders of the tech giants are enriching themselves beyond their ­wildest dreams — not just at our expense but at the expense of our children.So it’s pretty clear they won’t be doing anything to help.

The EU reckons Britain’s economic prospects are worse than those of anyone in its club.And its Remainer stooges pop up like automated bots to carp about their own country being “the sick man of Europe”.That’s the same Europe which has youth unemployment at ,  and . per cent in Spain, Italy and France, compared with our ..

But it will be flawed –– and Mrs May should say so.I admit this sounds odd: Why would a Prime Minister admit that a deal they have negotiated isn’t great ButMrs May tries to say that this agreement is perfect, and that there is no risk of any part of the UK getting stuck in the backstop — which would leave it in an EU customs union but with no say over the trade deals the EU is doing — then she will easily be disproved.Mrs May should take a leaf out of the book of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who as a hugely successful trial lawyer knows a fair bit about persuading people of his case.He told Cabinet on Tuesday that when it came to quitting the backstop “a unilateral right would give the UK greater scope to establish its case, as the other side would have to prove the contrary”.But he went on to acknowledge that negotiating a unilateral right to get out of the backstop was highly unlikely in the time available and a mutual review mechanism could be made to work.Cox’s essential argument is about managing risk. Every option on Brexit now carries with it risk.The challenge is to work out how to best manage these risks. The risk with accepting a legally binding backstop in the withdrawal agreement is that the UK ends up being unable to get out of it cleanly.It would be direthe UK ended up leaving the EU in a way that tied it to the EU for ever.But set against this must be the risk of no deal, and the disruption that would cause. To make matters worse, the Government has done absurdly little to mitigate no deal.The reason that even Cabinet ministers who loathe where the negotiations are heading do not want to go for no deal is they know how unprepared the country is for it.At the same time, there is a risk thatthere is no deal, Parliament would either insist on a second referendum — that would harden isions and toxy our politics — or cancel the process altogether, creating a dangerous democratic deficit.Frankly, the argument that Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement is less bad than the alternatives will be pretty much the only thing going for it.It will be hard for her to make this argument as so many of the deal’s problems are self-inflicted.She triggered Article  without knowing what the UK wanted she has wasted much of the past  months in a negotiation with her own Cabinet the failure to plan properly for no deal has weakened the Government’s negotiating position.Even the Parliamentary arithmetic has been made worse by Mrs May. If she hadn’t called that election, there would be a Tory majority and she wouldn’t be so reliant on the DUP.But it is the argument that her deal is less bad than the alternatives that is keeping the Cabinet on board and it is her best — and, possibly, only — way of getting the House of Commons to vote for such a flawed agreement.THE bad news for Theresa May is that it doesn’t get any easier once she’s got a deal with Brussels.For she will still have to get this withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons.With the DUP unhappy and  Tory Brexit ultras expected to vote against the deal, as well as Jo Johnson and other Tories who want another referendum, it will be extremely tough to get it over the line.“I can’t quite see where the majority comes from,” admits one Cabinet minister.But there is growing talk that the way to get the deal through might be to bring it back a second time, with the markets – which expect a deal – freaking out.As this Secretary of State says: “Do you get it through the first time  Maybe not.He did little to hide his irritation at being moved from his job as universities minister because of his opposition to Mrs May’s plan to tinker with tuition fees.But his resignation is a blow to the PM – and not just because of his attack on her for “a failure of British statecraft not seen since the Suez crisis”.His departure will put more pressure on those ministerial colleagues who privately share his view that a second referendum is needed, to go.With both Johnsons voting against the withdrawal agreement, it will become even harder to get it through the Commons.SO will any of the Cabinet resign over Theresa May’s Brexit plan  At the moment, ministers believe not.One of those who spoke against the May approach at Cabinet tells me the mood of the meeting was “resigned rather than resigning”.Another predicts critics of what Mrs May is doing “will make their point, then retreat”.This is not to say people are happy. Penny Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary, warned that voters wanted a “definitive end point to Brexit” andthey didn’t get it, that risked “feeding a narrative of betrayal, fuelling Ukip”.In private, ministers rail against Mrs May and the way she is handling the negotiations. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been heard to complain that the UK is making it far too obvious it is in a desperate hurry to get a deal.It is certainly true that by advertising its need for a quick agreement, the UK is almost inviting the EU to ask for more.Tellingly, there is renewed – and increasing – talk among ministers of having a new leader in place to do the next set of negotiations.There is little love for the backstop. And interestingly, Chancellor Philip Hammond argued in Cabinet this week it would be better to extend the transition than trigger the backstop.He argued that the backstop could do damage to supply chains and said “it could be better to extend the implementation period than have a bad backstop”.A problem with extending the implementation period is that it would mean free movement would continue – and the UK would still be sending huge amounts of money to Brussels every year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them. But, given that Kirk Douglas is , maybe it’s just a reminder that things come full circle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Town hall chiefs warn they are struggling to cope with the welfare overhaul, which sees housing benefit paid to tenants rather than directly to landlords as under the old regime. Council tenants on UC owe on average pound in rent - around two and a half times the amount owed by those still on housing benefit - pound, according to BBC Panorama. In Flintshire, North Wales, the amount of rent owed to the council by people on the Governments flagship welfare shake-up owe an average pound, - six times the amount owed by those on housing benefit. The councils housing chief Neal Cockerton said: “Flintshire has been a pilot for UC.  “Our other local authority colleagues are just coming into the full roll-out of UC, and some of the anecdotal conversations that we’re having is that, Oh dear, we’re going to be in a bit of a mess.” The Government was warned problems could be unleashed over the housing benefit shake-up. In , Professor Paul Hickman, of Sheffield Hallam University, was asked by the Department of Work and Pensions to investigate effects of paying the money to claimants to pass on to landlords. Identying a growth in rent arrears, his research showed only % of tenants managed to pay their rent in full. Prof Hickman told Panorama: “Were we ignored  “Some of what we said was listened to but I think they were so committed to the course of rolling-out universal credit. “Whatever we found they were going to continue to plough ahead.” The Department of Work and Pensions said more than % of claimants are paid on time, and insists there should be no issue with landlords receiving rent payments.  Meanwhile, a Resolution Foundation report reveals UC is set to be more expensive than the system it replaces thanks to changes unveiled in last months Budget. Measures announced by the Chancellor mean , more families will be better off due to the welfare reform, the think tank believes. Moves revealed by Philip Hammond will cut the number of working families losing out because of the changes from . million to three million. Those gaining increases from . million to . million, according to the Foundation. Working families with children are now just as likely to be better off under UC as worse off. Net losses are concentrated among non-parents, the study says. Mr Hammond acted amid mounting pressure from Labour, Tory rebels and the Mirrors Stop the Universal Credit Cruelty campaign. Our petition, launched in the run-up to the Governments financial showpiece, set out three options: redesign UC to be fit for purpose axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable or introduce a brand new system.

According to the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, funding per pupil has dropped % between   and   once inflation is taken into account. Mr Marr told him: You cut the budgets by % and they’ve been frozen only this year.  That is why head teachers and teachers and marching up and down Whitehall, that’s what they’re furious about. Mr Marr said many teachers see a new poundmillion fund for whiteboards and computers, branded little extras by Chancellor Philip Hammond in his Budget last month, as an insult. Mr Hinds insisted funding per pupil is now level. Look, it is true thatyou compare us to other countries we are relatively high spenders on state education, he said.  And it is also true that we spend more than we used to, but I do also recognise that budgets are very tight. There have been particular cost pressures on schools and so I’m very conscious of that and we have to do what we can. But Mr Marr continued: You cut it last year.

Tory Mr Hinds pressed on, insisting he found an extra pound.billion to hold constant the amount of funding per pupil. But the BBC interviewer snapped: You cut pupil funding last year. You did cut per pupil funding last year. It comes weeks after the UK Statistics Authority rebuked Mr Hinds for using figures in a way that risked undermining public trust. Sir David Norgrove, chair of the watchdog, said the Department for Education misrepresented school spending increases to make them look more signicant than they were.

The -year-old from Brimscombe, Gloucestershire, spotted the animal on October  when he was on his way home after collecting a memory foam mattress on his push bike, reports Gloucestershire Live.He said: “I stopped as I saw what I thought was a dog. It was as big as a Labrador but slim as a Dalmatian. It was snfing the ground. I thought that the owner would be coming along shortly as they may have let the dog off the lead at that time as no one  is normally around then walking their dogs along there.”  He soon realised it was not a dog in front of him but a big cat. Guillaume said he felt like he was in a dream but he was not scared. He said: “I walked and and wheeled my bike back slowly. It felt like I was in a dream. My instinct was to keep my eye on it and not turn my back on it. I did wonderit was going to come for me. I think that the creature would have been wondering what I am. “The animal would have seen me and a bike and a memory foam mattress. I think that the creature would have been wondering what I am. It would have been probably thinking what it saw.” Guillaume began to research big cat sightings and believes he may have seen a lynx. He also got in touch with Frank Tunbridge - a nature observer and enthusiast who had been looking into big cats in the area.  Frank said: Guillaume got in touch with me and he askedthere have been many sightings up there. “The big cats that are up there are breeding amongst themselves. The most abundant sighting of big cats that I am aware of are in Stroud. “The reason that they are there is because the wealthy and pop stars kept big cats in the ’s and ’s and then they let them out into the wild when the ‘Dangerous Animals Act ’ came in. “There is plenty of prey out there such as deer, pheasants and small mammals out there for them to survive. “This sighting like many cases, they surprise each other.

The remarkable Lady Sybil Grey could have enjoyed the comfortable le but instead she got stuck into the war effort, sailing to Russia to set up a hospital in devastated capital Petrograd. My grandmother was very determined and very brave, said Simon Boyd, author of Lady Sybil: Empire, War and Revolution, published by Hayloft. She travelled , miles, first across the North Sea where German U-boats were sinking Allied vessels. Although Russia was an ally she was doing what the Red Cross and other medical charities do now, which is to go into conflict zones and look after foreign casualties.  The second daughter of the fourth Earl Grey, Lady Sybil trained as a Voluntary Aid Detachmentnurse when the fighting began, first transforming her family home at Howick Hall in Northumberland into a hospital which looked after over  patients. “She trained at Newcastle Royal Infirmary about a month,” said Simon. “She came from a very protected background and thought seeing operations on wounds, ruined knees and empty eye sockets would worry her but she found it didnt worry her at all.” Lady Sybil, then , headed to Russia in October  to help set up the -bed Anglo-Russian Hospital, whose -strong team, mostly British, would treat , ordinary Russian soldiers over the two years of its existence.  One article from the time referred to Lady Sybils “coolness, her wisdom, her imperturbable common sense, her charm, her warm human sympathies and above all her unself-regarding devotion to duty”. “The First World War in a sense changed everything in terms of the role of women,” said Simon. “The men were away at the front, there were terrible casualties and people needed to take over their roles at home. To a great extent, womens contribution in the First World War made in inevitable in a way that women got the vote after the war.”  During her time in Russia, Lady Sybil led a field hospital to the front where she was wounded in the face by a hand grenade. After shrapnel hit her in the face, becoming embedded in her skull, she was rushed back to Petrograd for an operation before recovering in Britain for three months. She bravely ed to Russia, where there was fighting on the streets and a food shortage – at one point a mob invaded the hospital.

So imagine how tough it can be when youre serving  roast dinners in each of your restaurants every week and not just the extended family. Thats the task faced every week by the expert chefs of The Toby Carvery. Millions of families sit down to tuck into a delicious roast dinner every week - wherever they are in the world. So ahead of Remembrance Sunday - and in a bid to help readers who tackle the job of cooking the Sunday roast each week - weve brought The Toby Carvery together with the chefs of The Royal Navy to get their top tips in the above video. Toby Carvery - the Home of the Roast - has long been a supporter of the armed forces, offering free meals to troops on Armed Forces Day.  And in the above behind-the-scenes clip on board HMS Northumberland, Toby Carvery Chef Trainer James Smith joins forces with the Royal Navys Chef Mitchell to lt the lid on how best to cook meats, roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings and even gravy. Toby Carvery Chef James hails The Royal Navy for creating that home-from-home roast dinner experience at sea in the clip, saying: For many families, roast dinners are that one time everybody gets around that dining table. A really good roast dinner is just like having a really big hug on a plate!  Meanwhile, The Royal Navys chef Mitchell explains how important the traditional meal is to troops across the world. He adds: Ive cooked for Royalty and some of the biggest dignitaries of the Armed Forces, but every Sunday - guaranteed - ships across the world are having a roast dinner. Below, weve shared the top tips from the guys on the key ingredients to help families across the country cooking up a roast. Meats  Toby Carverys Chef James says: One of the tricks we use at Toby is to bloom our meat for a minimum of four hours first of all. So we take them out of the packaging and that lets the joints re-oxigise. We then load them into ovens and cook them really slowly. Letting them rest at the end is a key step to getting perfect beef. Yorkshire puddings  Were famous for our seven centimetre Yorkshire Puddings at Toby Carvery, reveals chef James. The trick to Yorkshires is making sure youve got really hot oil. Then add your batter to the oil and get them in the oven as quickly as you can. Roast potatoes Its all about the ruffling, chef James says, shaking a tray of uncooked but peeled and chopped spuds.  You want to shake them up and make sure you break the edges of the potatoes up. Then that will give us a really nice, crisp roast potato. Gravy  Chef James says: Theres nothing worse than thin or lumpy gravy! Consider adding cranberry sauce, mustard or horseradish. Meanwhile, The Royal Navys Chef Mitchell adds: We always go for a nice smooth, thick gravy. We normally put in a bit of red wine to give it a dferent taste. Ive even put Marmite in!Find your nearest Toby Carvery at www.tobycarvery"},{"url":null,"title":"jeffrey archer opens up jeremy","story":"NewsJeffrey Archer: Shamed Tory politician-turned writer was once bankrupt but is now worth £millionEXCLUSIVE: Despite numerous setbacks including a jail sentence for perjury he is now rich - beginning to feel guilty about his good fortuneShareCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsWealthy Jeffrey Archer is definitely loving le in  but fears Corbyns threats about taxing multi-millionaires \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe rise and fall then rise again of Jeffrey Archer is a story as compelling as any in the dozens of novels written by this best-selling phenomenon. Once a near-bankrupt, he is now worth an estimated poundmillion. Rich and privileged, a shamed Tory politician jailed for lying to a judge about paying a prostitute for sex, he is even beginning to feel guilty about his good fortune. The dizzying many lives of the boy from Weston-super-Mare include a magnicent penthouse on the south bank of the Thames, giving the controversial peer unrivalled views of a Parliament bankruptcy forced him to vacate as an MP before ing unelected.  The luxurious apartment is an art gallery in the sky, with Archer advising visitors seeking the bathroom during his Krug and shepherd’s pie parties to walk past the Monet then left at the Picasso. “No, no, no, no – I have never said it, have I Alison ”, he shrieks playfully to a devoted assistant. “No, he never has,” she replies in this little pantomime. All three of us know, of course, Archer does. Regularly. “It’s a tease,” he laughs defensively. “And I was told that under no circumstances was I to say that to you so you would take it seriously.”  The paintings are expensive signposts to a loo where another prized piece, a Hockney self-portrait, hangs over the toilet. The ex-Conservative vice-chair and potential Tory candidate for Mayor of London until jail and disgrace, rarely attends the Lords and is toying with retiring from it when he reaches  in two years. But he remains interested in politics. During our chat he breaks off to take a call within my hearing from Nadhim Zahawi, an education minister, with Archer passing on an uncannily accurate prediction gleaned from lunch with a Canadian former foreign secretary that Donald Trump would tighten his grip on the US Senate.  Despondent about his own warring party’s prospects, Archer frets Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would heavily tax multi-millionaires like himself. Worrying the ided Tories will beat themselves to gt the Islington revolutionary a backdoor key to No, Archer growls: “I don’t think Corbyn can win but I do think the Conservatives can lose.“It would be terrible. I can think of half a dozen leaders of the Labour Party I would welcome after a -year period and he is not one of them. “John McDonnell is not one of them.”  David Miliband, a Labour red prince over the water in the US, is one. Backbench MPs Chuka Umunna and Yvette Cooper are others.Labour is proposing to tax annual income above pound, at just p, yet at a higher rate the book machine concedes he would keep writing. Nor is he threatening to flee a Britain led by a Prime Minister Corbyn. “I want to live in this country. I love this country,” he emphasises.  “I want to see Somerset play cricket. I wish they’d win occasionally.I want to see Bristol Rovers play football. I wish they’d win occasionally. “I want to see the theatre twice a week. I want to go to art galleries twice a week, please. “You only get one le and those of my friends who’ve shot off to strange places,” he says before pausing momentarily, restarting with condemnation.“John Cleese, who I don’t know, I couldn’t believe it when he said he was going to Nevis. I had to look it up on the map. It’s got , people.” Nevis is a Caribbean tax haven, and the furthest Archer is likely to go is his palatial holiday villa on Majorca.  The storyteller’s latest novel is a thriller, Heads You Win, charting the fate of a teenager who escapes Russia after the KGB assassinates his trade union activist father.Effectively banned in Putin’s Russia where no company is willing to risk publishing the book, Archer acknowledges the Salisbury poisonings have pricked interest. Story telling caused Archer problems in his political le, with accusations he gilded achievements, including education, to give himself a leg up from a middle class background in Somerset before striking gold with the likes of Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less. Snooty literary critics resent his popularity – he has sold more than  million books – and a friend of the author claims Archer was a victim of snobbery much of his le. Was he aware of it “Oh very conscious of it,” replies Archer.  In the Lords, he adds, grand landed peers inheriting seats and country homes stretching back into the mist of time split between those who treated him as an equal and those who look down their noses.He says: “Snobbery in this country lasted a long time. “I love watching black and white movies when you see, not only are they better stories than you get now, but the snobbery is unbelievable. “If you go right back to Pride and Prejudice... there was an aristocracy, upper class, upper middle class, middle class, lower middle class, lower class and working class.  “And you knew which you belonged to and you could only fight to get to the one above. You couldn’t get right to the top.” Archer’s we Mary is a constant presence in his conversation despite not being present when I visited the penthouse. She had left earlier for London’s Science Museum which she chairs. Archer clearly adores the woman who stood by him after his public disgrace.  “She’s absolutely wonderful,” he says. “And I know how fortunate I am.” The once brash Tory thruster who survived cancer admits he has mellowed with age.“Yes. Everybody thinks so. It’s very sad,” he laughs.  “I had an Indian come in the other day... I said ‘listen, you worm’, and he said ‘oh my god, Jeffrey.“I remember the days when you called me a pathetic worm. What’s wrong, Jeffrey ’.” The pivotal moment was that  jailing for perjury which led to him campaigning for penal reform as well as producing, in typical Archer style, three bestselling volumes of prison diaries. “I certainly realised how privileged I was, how lucky I was,” he says. “There was one kid sitting on the end of the bed when I was leaving on the Monday and he said ‘I’d change places with you’. I said ‘wait a minute, I’m  years old. You’re . You’ve got a deal’. He said ‘No, no, I’m a heroin addict’ and he died two years later. “I see him on the bottom of the bed regularly.”  Archer is vowing to continue writing as long as readers buy his books. “Frightened to stop,” he says. “If the stories dried up I might say ‘I’m , what the hell  I’m going to live in Majorca and you can all jump in a lake’. “But as long as the stories are coming I’m going to go on and on and on.  “If you had a boring job putting wheels on cars for Volkswagen you might feel ‘at  I’m very happy to do something ’.“But I’ve got a very exciting job which I still enjoy.”Heads You Win by Jeffrey Archer is published by Pan Macmillan, pound."},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton ditches sombre black","story":"NewsKate Middleton ditches sombre black for green at poignant Remembrance serviceThe Duchess of Cambridge was joined by her husband and other members of the royal family for the service marking the centenary of the ArmisticeShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsKate Middleton wore a green dress for the occasion \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Duchess of Cambridge looked radiant in a green dress at the Service of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey this evening.

We reflect on how people were led into the war and how the war came to an end and on the uneasy peace that followed with its continuing suffering and the disruption of families and ways of le.  Above all, in our remembrance and reflection, we hope for a time when aggression between peoples and nations is transformed into friendship and collaboration, when all may live side by side in mutual encouragement and harmony and the weapons of war are transformed into the instruments of peace.Actress Sophie Okonedo read from the diaries of social reformer Beatrice Webb, dated November  . The diary entry said: PEACE! London to-day is a pandemonium of noise and revelry, soldiers and flappers being most in evidence.  Multitudes are making all the row they can, and in spite of depressing fog and steady rain, discords of sound and struggling, rushing beings and vehicles fill the streets. Paris, I imagine, will be more spontaneous and magnicent in its rejoicing. Berlin, also, is reported to be elated, having got rid not only of the war but also of its oppressors. The peoples are everywhere rejoicing.

Adam Joy used to drink fty pints a week with late-night drinking sessions and always started his day with cheese and sausage rolls. But now the -year-old is a new man after losing a whopping -and-a-half-stone and opting for early-morning runs with his personal trainer. The father-of-two from Dartford, Kent, started his weight-loss journey last year after he struggling to get up the stairs and suffering from high blood pressure. He said: I couldnt get up the stairs, there was even a time at Twickenham where I couldnt get up to the next floor to watch the game.  The publican decided to get in touch with his local Slimming World centre and has set himself a target of getting a well-defined six-pack by New Years Eve. He said: Now I still enjoy myself, I drink gin and slimline and still eat a cooked breakfast with bubble and squeak - just with leaner sausages. The message I want to get across to people is that fad diets did not change my weight, its about long term strategies. I now run four times a week and I go to the gym three or four times as well where I hit the weights.  Adam now combines high-protein and low fat meals with long walks with his dog and has managed to slash his waistline by six inches. His morning routine now consists of a grilled Full English and he will finish the day with a high protein milkshake and fruit. The new lestyle has even rubbed off on the family, with Adam acting as head chef for his family and -year-old we Carol-Ann.  His weight-loss success saw him win the Slimming World Man of the Year competition and he has also become a fat-loss mentor in Bexley, south-east London. His pub - the Bird in Hand - also stocks  healthy gin options and runs healthy curry nights. He said: I lost my first  stone in seven months through doing no additional exercise - its all about the diet to begin with.

Standing before the Queen, Lucy Attrill summed up the mood of a nation with a poem as fitting as any to commemorate the sacrice made for us in the trenches so long ago. “If you hadn’t given your le in France  If you hadn’t stepped on that train  Your boys might have had a father  But our world might not be the same.” Its poignant lines struck the perfect chord. And the title – simply “Thank You” – resounded back down the years amid the reverent silence of London’s Royal Albert Hall. It marked the highlight of a moving service attended by Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as well as other senior royals.  Birmingham schoolgirl Lucy had written the winning poem in a Royal British Legion contest to honour the , British troops who died. Her own great-grandfather George Alfred Attrill was one of the lucky ones. He served in the Royal Navy in both world wars – the second time on a hospital ship – and survived. You grew up too fast, Age twelve you were dumped in a factory, When you should have been in class. You missed out on education, For the good of our world today, Instead, you had to make weapons, That’s a debt we can’t repay. Thank you. You left your le behind, Your we, your children, everything, But your luck was not so kind. If you hadn’t given your le in France, If you hadn’t stepped on that train, Your boys might have had a father, But our world might not be the same. So, to everyone whose le was lost, Or ruined, or halted or messed, You all deserve more thanks than you got, You all deserve the best. Thank you Lucy’s spine-tingling verse was only matched in the domed hall by Prince Harry and Meghan’s royal wedding cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason who played Hallelujah while images from the First World War were projected onto gauze screens above him. Sir Tom Jones, Tom Fletcher, Danny Jones, Sheridan Smith and The Kingdom Choir also performed, with a finale that saw thousands of poppy petals fall from the roof. The festival was one of a series of events yesterday on the eve of the th anniversary of Armistice Day.  Earlier, the Duke of Sussex was at Twickenham to lay a wreath ahead of the rugby clash between England and New Zealand. Harry also met descendants of two England captains Lancelot Slocock and Ronnie Poulton who died in the conflict. Poulton’s great nephew James Garnett said: “It was very emotional.” Yesterday also saw the end of The Long Walk Home, a four-day challenge in which  veterans walked  miles from Ypres in Belgium – the scene of three major battles – to the Cenotaph. Among the walkers was -year-old Pete Barron, a former Lieutenant Colonel with the Royal Corps of Signals for  years, and his stepson Matthew McGinn, , who still serves with the RCS. Pete, of Ludlow, Shrops, carried with him the war medals of his grandfather John Webb who survived the Somme campaign to win a Distinguished Conduct Medal.  And he also had with him a bronze medallion known as the “death penny” given to the family of his Royal Navy great uncle Albert Brown who didn’t make it home. Pete – who has raised pound, for the Haig Housing Trust which provides homes for veterans – said: “I was doing the walk he couldn’t do.” An estimated . million military personnel lost their lives in the First World War and  million were wounded. Among them was -year-old Private George Edwin Ellison from York – killed by a German sniper just  minutes before the Armistice at am on November , , that ended the four-year conflict. Today the leaders of France and Germany joined in a show of unity - holding hands and resting their heads against each other. President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met in Compiegne, France, where the Armistice was signed in a railway carriage. In the UK, silhouettes of soldiers from the First World War were projected on to famous landmarks.  The Tommies illuminated Marble Arch, Tate Modern, HMS Belfast, Warwick Castle, the Angel of the North, the Tyne Bridge, Titanic Belfast, Cardf Castle and Edinburgh Castle. General the Lord Dannatt, patron of There But Not There and ex-Chief of the General Staff, said: “It is vital we reflect on the sacrice made by an entire generation of servicemen and women. These landmarks provide a remarkable representation of the nation doing that. “We have been moved by the overwhelming public support which has led to more than poundmillion raised for military and mental health charities.”  Sunday’s events will begin at am as pipers play the traditional Scottish lament, Battle’s O’er, at , locations across the world. Then at am Britain will fall silent for two minutes. At .pm church bells will ring. And in the evening The Last Post will be sounded by more than , buglers before Beacons of Light are lit from Land’s End to John O’Groats at pm, symbolising an end to the darkness of war.

Alongside the crack pipes and tin foil that littered the carpet were sweet treats like lollipops and empty Kinder Egg containers.  Police also came across cash and lists of phone numbers with no names next to them. Nightmare neighbours Donna Simons and Leigh Dixon have been forced out of the home after accepting a closure order sought by council chiefs. The pair did not contest the three-month closure order which was sought by Plymouth City Council at a short hearing at Plymouth Magistrates Court on Tuesday.  Plymouth City Councils legal representative presented a thick file of evidence which included reports of a sustained period of drug-related activity at the property. The material was backed up by police reports, witness statements and scene photographs of the items officers found. In addition, the magistrates heard this was not the first time the pair had been subject of a closure order.  The councils legal representative noted how Simons and Dixon had been ordered out of another flat earlier this year following similar complaints and evidence. John Haythorne, mitigating for Simons, and in response to the councils application for court costs, said his client was now homeless and was reliant on benefits. He added: She is, to put it simply, a drug addict. We dont know where she is going to be or her means. She is also in the worst possible health.  Magistrates agreed the council could attempt to recover pound, court costs from the pair. A spokesman for the council said: The order was granted under section  of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act . Tenants Donna May Simons and Leigh Neville Dixon did not contest the hearing. The closure follows a signicant increase in the amount of violence and disorder surrounding the address linked to the tenants and others who reside or frequent the address.  Councillor Sally Haydon, cabinet member for customer focus and community safety, said: “Anti-social behaviour is not tolerated in Plymouth.That message is clear. If you make innocent, law-abiding residents lives a misery, then we will act, and we will put a stop to it.  Sgt Hayley Manning, of the neighbourhood policing team, said: “Police and Plymouth City Council have successfully been granted a three month closure order by Plymouth magistrates court at number  Melbourne Street.The closure comes following repeated reports of anti-social behaviour and drug misuse at the address, causing disruption and distress to local residents and the local community. “This closure shows a great example of the commitment of police and partner agencies to reducing crime and anti-social behaviour in our communities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast more downpours","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: More downpours and thunder expected after weekend washoutBut things are looking up with highs of up to C expected from Wednesday, marking the warmest mid-November for  yearsShareCommentsByNatalie EvansUS Editor Alistair Grant:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video last-minute-indian-summer-predicted-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrits are facing a soggy start to the week as the heavy rain and thunder that washed out the weekend looks set to continue. Yellow weather warnings were issues as Remembrance Sunday showers hit yesterday after south Wales suffered floods on Saturday for the second time in three weeks. It is expected to be a damp day across western parts of the UK today with heavy showers and thunder forecast. There will be showers across southern parts of England too. However, it will be a drier day further east with spells of sunshine.  Showers will continue across western and southern parts of the UK into tonight, but these will begin to ease for southern areas towards the end of the night. It will be drier further east with a few clear spells, but there is the risk for a few showers spreading into north-east England by dawn.  But, the UK is set for its warmest mid-November days for  years with highs of up to C from Wednesday starting a week-long warm and mainly dry spell with sunny periods for all. Wednesday could be the warmest November  since records began in highs beat the .c recorded in Cwmbargoed, Glamorgan, Wales.  The high temperatures are caused by El Nino - the warming of eastern Pacic sea-surface temperatures - but this could also bring late winter freezes, as it did in  . But the high temperatures wont last long as the weather it set to go form mild to wild later in the month. The Met Office said a bitter last week of November could bring snow to the north of the country.  Freezing conditions are also expected after Christmas with -c temperatures, snow, ice and travel chaos forecast in January by The Weather Outlook. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Glaze said: “Britain’s weather looks like going from mild to wild. “Indian Summer conditions in coming days see C sunny spells challenging date records. “But it is set to turn much colder ahead, and after Christmas is forecast spells of snow, ice and travel disruption, with lows down to -C in parts of Scotland and -C in England.” Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: “Remembrance Sunday had a high chance of showers, with Monday also showery. “But high pressure builds with dry and fine conditions for many southern and eastern areas on Wednesday, spreading to the North as well from Thursday until the weekend, with very mild temperatures and highs around C. “Settled weather continues until November , although there could be low cloud and fog at times. “But the big change ahead is to a colder last week of the month, moving from above to below-average temperatures with the risk of wintry conditions in the North.” The Met Office three-month forecast said that El Nino implies an increase in the likelihood of milder-than-average conditions for the UK.

Douglas Plumpton, , appeared at Liverpool Crown Court for sentencing after he was found guilty of the murder of Iain Maddocks following a nine day trial. Plumpton initially claimed he was acting in self-defence when Mr Maddocks came to his flat armed with a kitchen kne. He further claimed that he grabbed the sword, which was one of two he had to help him make scenes realistic in a Game of Thrones-type novel he was writing. But his version of events was rejected by the jury, and passing sentence Judge Alan Conrad QC said he was satisfied both the kne and the sword had been used by Plumpton in the attack on Mr Maddocks. In her personal victim statement, read out in court, Mr Maddocks mum Linda said the death of her son was the worst day of my le. Prostitute says she sits back and smokes crack as daughter goes off with puntersShe added: When my eldest son told me Iain had been stabbed, I went hysterical. I was on the floor screaming when I found out. My le has been devastated. Im angry we had to be put through this trial when we could have been spared this heartache. This is something you never get over as a mum. I just wish I could change places with him. She said her sons death was made worse by the fact it occurred on his nd birthday. She added: Easter Day  was a very special day when he was born.  My le changed dramatically on the day Iain was taken from us. It was so unreal, like having some nightmare. There were  people at his funeral. His friends have been amazing. She said losing her son and the stress of the trial had caused her hair to fall out, and she had also been unable to go back to work. Plumpton, a prolic drug abuser and low-level drug dealer who was known to his friends by the nickname  Rasta Jack , was angry about a debt which Mr Maddocks owed him. The court heard that the disagreement between the two men, who both lived in flats in Birkenhead was over pound which Mr Maddocks had borrowed from Plumpton, of which he had only paid back pound. As part of the ongoing feud, Plumpton damaged Mr Maddocks car headlights.  On Good Friday this year, on what was his nd birthday, Mr Maddocks visited Plumpton at his flat. The attack took place on the landing outside the doorway of the flat, during which Mr Maddocks suffered a number of stab and slash wounds. The cause of death was shock and haemorrhage caused primarily by a cut to the femoral artery in Mr Maddocks left leg. Passing sentence, Judge Conrad told Plumpton:untimely death, in the horric circumstances in which it took place, has caused misery and pain to those close to him. He had done nothing to deserve the brutal armed violence that you used and which ended his le. I am satisfied so as to be sure that you used two weapons - sword and kne - in your attack upon Mr Maddocks.  I conclude that when Mr Maddocks came to the door - at a time that he believed that you may have been responsible for damaging his car - you armed yourself with the two weapons for use in the attack upon him. You adopted a selfish lestyle, spending large amounts on drugs, and supplying drugs on a small scale to people known to you, including Mr Maddocks, whose debt to you was the real cause of your annoyance. Plumpton, whose former dreadlocks had been shorn off and who was wearing a grey suit, showed no emotion as he was led down from the dock after being sentenced to le imprisonment, with a minimum term of  years.

He was among  world leaders who united at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to mark  years since the end of the Great War. They included US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who all put their problems and dferences to one side to honour the millions lost in the conflict. Mr Putin gave Mr Trump a thumbs up before they shook hands and sat down to listen to Mr Macron’s -minute speech in the ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. And he appeared to be aiming his remarks at the US President, who frequently talks of “America First” policies.  Mr Macron said: shy“Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. “By saying our interests first, who cares about the others, we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it le, what makes it great and what is essential: its moral values. “I know there are old demons which are coming back to the surface.  “They are ready to wreak chaos and death. History sometimes threatens to take its sinister course once again. “Let us build our hopes rather than playing our fears against each other. “Ruining this hope with a fascination for withdrawal, violence or domination would be a mistake for which future generations would rightly find us responsible.  “May this gathering not be just one day. This fraternity, my friends, invites us, indeed, to lead together the only combat that is worthwhile: the fight for peace, the fight of a better world. “During these four years, Europe failed to commit suicide. Mankind had sunk into the hideous labyrinth of merciless clashes, into a hell that engulfs all fighters of whatever side, of whatever nationality they were.” Thousands of ordinary French people had also turned out, despite persistent heavy rain.  Several wore bright red poppies as a mark of respect to the British and Commonwealth troops who paid the ultimate price in the conflict – which claimed around . million soldiers and  million civilians. Just before the leaders assembled, a topless female protester with the words “fake peacemaker” scrawled across her chest came within a few metres of Mr Trump’s motorcade before security swooped and grabbed her. Mr Macron and fellow dignitaries had marched to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the Arc de Triomphe beneath black umbrellas while church bells tolled throughout the French capital. The service ended with the same bugle call that was played at am on November ,  to signal the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front.  Mr Trump, who was accompanied by First Lady Melania, later went to the cemetery of Suresnes, in the suburbs of the city, where hundreds of American soldiers are buried. The President had earlier sparked shywidespread criticism for pulling out a similar visit, blaming it on the rain. Meanwhile, there were ceremonies taking place all over the world, emphasising the number of countries that had been affected by the Great War. In Australia, thousands gathered at the official national service at the Australian War Memorial in capital Canberra, where Prime Minister Scott Morrison led a minute’s silence.  In Sydney, crowds gathered at the Anzac Memorial, which the Duke of Sussex unveiled an extension to during his recent royal tour. And there was also a service at the Shrine of shyRemembrance in Melbourne. Some , Australians served overseas during the First World War, the vast majority of them on the Western Front alongside British soldiers and their allies. More than , died – over two-thirds of them on the battlefields of Europe.  Large crowds also attended the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington for New Zealand’s main remembrance ceremony. Nearly , New Zealanders served in units overseas, with around a fth of them never ing home. And commemorations were held all over Russia, which had a population of around  million when the conflict broke out and had suffered . million losses by the time it was over.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

Accusations of spies lurking furtively in the shadows. And claims of sabotage as posters advertising a “summit” meeting are mysteriously ripped off walls and hoardings. No – it’s not a meeting of the Klu Klux Klan in Hickory Hollow, Arakansas in the s. And no . . . it’s not a clandestine, cover-up being leaked in the basement of Washington’s Watergate Hotel in the s. This is Troon, South Ayrshire  . . . and the cloak-and-dagger involves the proposed take-over of a community activity centre. It’s Dundonald Gymnastics Clubversus Muirhead Tennants and Residents Association . And in the middle we have SAC. Normally this would mean South Ayrshire Council . . . but in this case, it really stands for Sell All Centres. Andthere’s room for another acronym – let’s throw in the real reason behind this rammy – it’s called C.A.T . . . Community Asset Transfer. SAC wants to get Muirhead Activity Centre – and its running costs – off its books. DCG – a well organised and well funded gymnastic club – would love it as their new permanent home. They’re currently based in Dundonald Activity Centre – but having to move vaulting horses and other equipment after every session is apparently getting in the way of healthy exercise. With DACattached to Dundonald Primary School and protected from CAT, the Muirhead building is a sitting target for them. But DGC operate classes seven days a week – and a take-over would leave little or no room for other sports and clubs that currently use Muirhead. And it’s this possible exclusion of other sports and interests - by a single self-serving club - that has rightly upset MTRA. But the real villain in this localised skirmish is the Community Asset Transfer policy itself. Our local council is using it as a convenient back door to off load the expense of running village halls and community properties across the whole of South Ayrshire. Interestingly, last week’s Budget - in a nod to the centenary of  – announced extra funding to protect and preserve the many village halls built to help small communities recover from the ravages of the Great War. In stark contrast, South Ayrshire Council wants to wash their hands of them! The Muirhead decision will finally fall to a full SAC meeting. It will be interesting to seethe four elected Troon councillors look their constituents in the eye – or choose to look away in line with council policy. From where I sit, Dundonald Gymnastics Club has  plus members, a waiting list, over  internet followers and employs more coaches than Dodds of Troon. It appears everyone and their auntie wants to see the wean wearing a wee blue leotard and a medal. That’s fine. But surely not at the expense of other children with other interests and needs. If DGC want a place to themselves – let them find it and fund it themselves.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilSchoolsWorld War TroonDundonaldAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13556297.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166933205.jpg","title":"cafe owners ayrs newmarket street","story":"NewsCafe owners in Ayrs Newmarket Street pay tribute to businessman Craig BrysonKaren and Nino Pajovic say they have lost \"one of their own\" in the passing of Craig Bryson, .ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsNino and Karen with their tribute \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCafe owners in Ayr’s Newmarket Street this week led tributes to their “loyal friend” Craig Bryson.

Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Although black officers were not allowed in the British Army at this time, he was commissioned in May , thus becoming the first black combat officer in the British Army. He died in battle in France in , during the last major German offensive. His body was never found. Walter will be remembered this Sunday as the public pay their respects to millions of fallen servicemen. • Activities on Ayr beach will happen between .am and am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnBritish ArmyArmed forcesAdoptionWorld War Ayr United FCAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"detectives step up hunt armed","story":"NewsDetectives step up their hunt for armed thugs who attacked and attempted to rob woman in her homeShareByGary Fanning:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsPolice are now appealing for information after the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDetectives today have stepped up their hunt for two armed thugs who attacked a terried woman and tried rob her in her Ayr home.

The incident along with other concerns has sparked a proposed shake-up of taxi and private hire rules. The middle seat in the front could be ditched from fleets of larger vehicles following a public consultation. The public are going to be askedpeople should still be allowed to sit in the front of vehicles. The consultation will also questionthe number of passengers sitting up front should be reduced to one. South Ayrshire Council’s Leadership Panel heard last week how the middle passenger was seated too close to drivers. A report presented to councillors said the close proximity left drivers open to accusations of “inappropriate conduct. Explaining one incident reported to the council,licensing team leader Morag Douglas said: “There were concerns that a driver was threatened by young girls who booked a private hire. “They left without paying and stated thatthe driver took any action the driver would be reported to the police for inappropriate conduct.” She said the council received other gripes from drivers about what a tight squeeze it is with two passengers in the front. Ms Douglas told how drivers said having “two larger people in the front seats” meant it is dficult to control the car without touching middle seat passengers. All eight seater vehicles licensed by the council have two passenger seats in the front and six in the back. Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “It is as much about protecting the drivers as the passengers.” He added: “We need to be cautious and make sure that whatever we come up with doesn’t have unintended consequences.” Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils don’t permit passengers in the front seats of taxis. Feedback from South Ayrshire Taxi and Private Hire Operators’ Forum members suggested the inidual drivers should decidethey want passengers up front. The members also told the council there should still be an option to have two passengers seated in the front. There are  licensed taxis and  private hire vehicles in South Ayrshire.

Landowner Red Button is already quids in after getting permission to reduce the size of the car park and build a Costa coffee unit.

to support the Bible Society and help put Bibles in the hands and hearts of people worldwide.‘No-one does Bible Weekend as well as you do in Campbeltown,’ he added.The Bible Society aims to put the Bible into everyone’s hands in a language they understand and in a format they can use.Adrian said: ‘Less than ten per cent of the world’s languages have the full Bible in their own language, less than one third have the New Testament  and more than  million people,  languages, still do not have even one book of the Bible in their mother tongue.#Aunty Rebecca Fawcett, Matilda Taverner,  days,

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices. Money will have to be found and some services which are lsquonice to haversquo may have to see new or increased charges.

This process starts again now and the Conservative Group will play the fullest role it can in determining a responsible approach to our vital infrastructure.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said: ldquoMore investment is required in roads to ensure that we keep up the momentum.ldquoIt is concerning that the current level of investment is not enough to prevent conditions deteriorating further.

With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

The location has been selected as it forms the primary gateway into the town and is visible from the railway line, said the applicants.Ken Ross, from applicant Hallhill Development Ltd, said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Scottish Government has approved this fantastic piece of public art and are actively engaged with Andy to get the bear erected in Dunbar in spring .ldquoThis piece of art will not only contribute to the emerging identity of Dunbarrsquos new gateway but has the potential to draw people into the area to find out more about John Muir.Mr Ross was confident the sculpture would prove popular with children and would become a landmark.The sculpture is made of welded steel and fabricated from steel plates of ious thicknesses, heavy at the bottom and lighter towards the top. Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

around  years ago in the Neolithic era and there is evidence that Viking raiders ransacked the islands.The lands around Balloch ndash which means ldquovillage on the loch in Gaelic - were granted to the Lennox family in  by King Malcolm III, and the original Balloch Castle was built there in the th century.Loch Lomond became an established destination for visitors in the th century and was already popular enough for James Boswell to remark on hisfrom the Western Isles with Dr Johnson in  that he did not need to describe it in his journal.Balloch, which sits on the River Leven, grew up

And right here is where you start paying hellip in sweat.Imagine, then, my excitement when I found out that itrsquos not too late to don a leotard and pair of footless tights ndash legwarmers optional ndash and release my inner ballerina.Adult ballet is a fast growing trend, thanks mostly to the revived interest in dance sparked by the reality TV series Strictly Come Dancing.There are now adult classical ballet classes for Absolute Beginners at Scottish Ballet, where you can learn how to do a plieacute without the pressure of feeling like a failureyou donrsquot make the corps de ballet.Anybody of any age, shape or fitness level can and does take part in these classes. Ballet is great for fitness, boosting cardio, strength and flexibility, co-ordination and balance and is weight-bearing so it helps build muscles and bones. Ballet burns  calories an hour ndash more than a spin class ndash and is fantastic for posture and is also a known stress buster.There are waiting lists to get on the Scottish Ballet -week courses for absolute beginner, beginner and intermediate dancers and I found out why when I signed up for an absolute beginnersrsquo class there.Dance teacher Preston Clare is not quite as strict as Debbie Allenrsquos character Lydia Grant in Fame, but he does insist on correct technique with his students, who range in age from  to late s.ldquoI want everyone to be safe, so I teach them how to bend with their knees over the toes and the proper way to move through the foot against the floor so there arenrsquot any injuries, he says.One of the joys of teaching this class, Preston says, is watching the transformation in his students.ldquoTherersquos one man who is quite heavy. He had such a curved spine and hunched shoulders that when he lay flat on his back, his head couldnrsquot touch the floor. After a few weeks of ballet, he can now lie flat and hersquos lost a lot of weight.One of the reasons ballet is such an effective way to change your body, he explains, is the music ndash classes at Scottish ballet are accompanied by pianist Michael Barnett.ldquoProfessional ballet dancers have the physiques of athletes but dance is an art form, not a sport. The music lts you up ndash it helps you reach that bit further.Preston shows me into the large, bright studio at Scottish Balletrsquos headquarters at the Tramway in Glasgow. I gaze longingly at a pile of colourful tutus stacked outside the class but have to content myself with what Irsquom wearing: gym gear I usually wear to pilates. I notice the other women are in black leotards and tights with flippy little ballet skirts, but at least I have proper soft ballet shoes.Irsquove always been hopeless at learning new steps and Irsquom a little nervous about looking like one of the dancing hippos in Disneyrsquos Fantasia. However, Preston reassures me that everyone starts out the same.ldquoRelax and have fun, he says. ldquoMy students know they are not going to join a ballet company they are here to enjoy themselves. I love teaching adult beginners because they are so dedicated.Alexandra Lesley, an actress in her early s, and her partner, Keith Hooley, , are certainly committed: they travel from Thornhill in Dumfriesshire to attend the class once a week, a round trip of three hours.ldquoI love it. I get such a buzz and come out walking on air, says Alexandra. ldquoBallet keeps me fit and flexible.Keith, a retired quality controller, says: ldquoAlexandra encouraged me to go with her and I really enjoy it. My sciatica cleared up after one class and I donrsquot slouch any more. It also helps to keep my mind sharp ndash ballet doesnrsquot just exercise your muscles, joints and ligaments. At home we practise in the kitchen, using the counter tops as a barre.Josh Polson, , a teacher from Glasgow, has been impressed by how much more flexible and stronger he is playing American football since starting ballet last year. He was inspired to take up ballet after seeing his girlfriend, who is with Scottish Ballet, on stage.ldquoIrsquod never done anything like this before and wanted to see how dficult it was. Now I have even more respect for my girlfriend and how hard she works.Josh, too, finds the benefits arenrsquot just physical.ldquoI have a stressful job teaching children with behavioural dficulties. Ballet is very calming and allows me to switch off because Irsquom focusing so much on the steps.Itrsquos time for me to join the class. We start off with some simple barre exercises and I soon get into the swing of things, despite wobbling when we have to let go the barre and balance on tiptoe on one leg. Preston keeps the atmosphere light with some teasing and jokes and Irsquom soon having fun.ldquoThis is easy-peasy, I think, dreaming of skipping straight to beginners. But it soon gets harder as we move into a Polonaise ndash a skipping, sliding dance invented by Louis IV, to allow men at his court to show off their calves. I soon get mixed up with the steps but manage to keep up. The pirouette is trickier to master as you have to whip your head around as you turn to avoid being dizzy. I end up dizzy ndash and hot and sweaty.Ballet is much harder than I expected and the next day my calf, arm and stomach muscles ache.A beginnersrsquo over-s class, surely, will be easier. But the class at Dance Factory on Glasgowrsquos Southside, is also demanding. After a few simple barre exercises, I end up tripping over two left feet during the dance sequence. I can sort of do the graceful arms, though, and channel Margot Fonteyn. The other women skip about with confidence, landing softly when they jump, their backs straight and arms properly swan-like. They may be in their s and s, but there isnrsquot a middle-aged spread or dowagerrsquos hump to be seen.ldquoBallet is excellent for strengthening your core and improving posture, says dance teacher Olivia McLay. ldquoItrsquos good for menopausal women because it builds bone mass ndash bones begin to thin at that age. It improves physical and mental agility, helps with balance, co-ordination and memory because you have to learn a sequence of steps.ldquoI sleep better, Irsquom stronger and feel more stretched and mindful, says Linda Weir, , from Glasgow. lsquoI just love it and would recommend it as a way to be stronger and fitter. Irsquove also made friends.Alison Lock, , from Glasgow said: ldquoItrsquos a physical and mental workout. Itrsquos much more fun than going to the gym, and it has stopped me feeling isolated.Linda Trainor, , was a talented ballerina as a child who won a scholarship at to the Royal Academy of Dance, but had to leave when her mother died.ldquoI always felt there was a hole in my le and itrsquos been wonderful to go back to ballet, even this late in le. It makes me happy.The many physical and mental benefits are the reason Scottish Ballet has classes for people with dementia, Parkinsonrsquos Disease, and a class for the elderly called Regenerate. Soon there will a class for people with multiple sclerosis.ldquoThere are proven benefits, says Catherine Cassidy, director of engagement at Scottish Ballet, who has seen a growing interest in the adult beginnersrsquo classes since they started three years ago.ldquoBallet improves balance, co-ordination and fluidity of movement. The music and rhythm combined with visualising unfolding your wings like a swan, for example, helps people with neurological conditions to move.ldquoBallet is also relaxing and gives you a sense of achievement as you master new skills. The mental health benefits are huge.Kerry Livingstone, head of the associatesrsquo programme at Scottish Ballet and head of Ballet at the Royal Conservatoire, says: ldquoIn these fast-paced days of social media and constant interruptions from emails and text messages, ballet forces you to concentrate fully and is great for mindfulness. It gives you self-discipline and because itrsquos an art, itrsquos uplting and creative.Undeterred by my clumsiness and encouraged by Preston and Olivia, Irsquove signed up for an Absolute Beginners course at Scottish Ballet ndash and Irsquom absolutely loving it.Ill never be the next Darcy Bussell but Irsquoll hopefully be stronger, more flexible and have the poise and graceful posture of a ballerina.See www.scottishballet and www.dancefactory"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-calendar-captures-the-beauty-of-scotland","story":"Herald calendar captures the beauty of ScotlandAn early morning view of the River Shiel near to Acharacle, on the Ardnamurchan ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtpeninsula.

I also have a mm-m Canon, which is a great lens but I havenrsquot used it as often as I thought I would.ldquoI always use a tripod and a remote control when Irsquom doing serious pictures ndash I prefer not to hand-hold the camera in that sort of situation, involving long exposures. If yoursquore shooting a waterfall you might need an exposure of three or four seconds, for example.At first, Mr Stokes did wildle photography, ldquobut there is so much time involved in it, he says. ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking, trying to get a bird to land in a specic place or a squirrel to do your bidding. But landscape photography has its own heartache as well. You can run down to a scene where there are perfect reflections in the water but by the time you get down to the loch, it is full of ripples hellip and it drives it nuts, but that is all part of the fun.His shot of Buachaille Etive Mograver was taken from the frozen river at Kingshouse Hotel, in Glencoe. And at Loch Awe his eye was caught by the ldquototal flat calm of the reflection.ldquoThe two shots were bonus pictures, as I call them. Irsquom usually up at four in the morning when I leave Dunoon and Irsquom up north in pitch darkness, waiting for sunrise. Then I work my way through til about pm and I think, thatrsquoll do me.ldquoI shot both Buachaille and Loch Awe on my way home, though I donrsquot think they were on the same day.

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms.

My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys.

It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

First based in an old wood-chopping factory in the grounds of Whitefoord House in Edinburgh, it moved in  to an old printing works in the city’s Warriston Road.And after this year’s very special Armistice centenary year, the factory will be on the move again – albeit on a temporary basis.A team of around  ex-servicemen and women who hand-assemble more than five million poppies and , wreaths every year for the Scottish Poppy Appeal will be moving to Redford Barracks for two years to allow for a much-needed refurbishment of the factory.The aim is not to rip out the heart of what is a very special workplace – boasting regimental flags and thank you letters and posters from the thousands of school children who have visited.But some £. million from the Libor Fund – fines imposed on banks for manipulation of Libor levels – will ensure the factory is fit for the st Century.Overseeing the move immediately after this year’s Remembrance Day will be factory manager Charlie Pelling, who has been at the helm since .During a tour of the factory, Charlie explained more about the move.He said: “We’ll be moving on November  with the aim of being operational by the start of January.“The aim is to be back at our factory in time for the  or  appeal.“We have a small window of opportunity to make the move as the factory operates year round.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buteman webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Special year...for PoppyScotland with Gordon Michie, its head of fundraising, hoping to raise an additional #, from the  Poppy Pledge campaign. \"  \"  Armistice : PoppyScotland’s  Poppy Pledge campaign viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"“We are like a toy shop in that we work  months of the year with sales throughout that period but our sales climax in the run-up to Remembrance Day in the way a toy shop does at Christmas.“We’ve got to strip out asbestos from the factory, update the heating and wiring, modernise the windows and install a lt to the first floor.“We have to make the factory health and safety compliant and fit for purpose for the st Century.”Charlie is also hopeful that they will be able to create a learning facility.He said: “Thousands of visitors tour the factory every year – from pensioners to pre-schoolers.“Around  school children visit the factory each year, with the same number of adults too.“We want to create an educational facility where they learn about the factory before touring the site.”The workers who power the factory will, however, remain at its beating heart and will be involved in the refurbishment and move.“We have records for more than  servicemen and women who have worked here,” said Charlie. “Since , we’ve had in excess of  workers.“The factory exists to provide employment for ex service personnel who may otherwise struggle to find employment.“They work year round to ensure that enough poppies are created for the Poppy Appeal and for the many wreaths laid at ceremonies across the country.“The move to Redford Barracks will undoubtedly be challenging.“But we’ve got a plan and some very good people here so we’re confident we’ll do it and still be able to create all the poppies for .“The fact we don’t have a modern production line is something we cherish.

guide...David Adamsonwas on hand to show us around as we toured the Lady Haig Poppy Factory in Edinburgh, prior to its temporary move to Redford Barracks on November  this year to allow the premises to be refurbished. And it’s perhaps for this reason when you walk through the Lady Haig Poppy Factory doors in Edinburgh, there’s a sense of leaving your worldly woes behind.There’s also no sense that the  or so former service personnel are standing on ceremony for visitors – the good-natured banter continues as they go about their business.It’s a camaraderie sadly now missing from many workplaces where the bottom line means more than the product.But here the focus is firmly on production with pride in every poppy that leaves the factory floor. feels at home at the factory, where he has worked part time since Decemver .

He hopes, in future, toto college to become a counsellor and help other veterans who find themselves in his position. Previously housing a printing press, it somehow feels like home – not least because we are warmly welcomed like old friends.It’s a special year for the veterans, marking  years since the end of World War One and the creation of a unique anniversary poppy.But the pressure is largely off when we visit as the majority of the five million or so poppies created for this year’s appeal have already been despatched.Work continues apace, though, as staff finish off wreath orders which will be laid at ceremonies theand breadth of the country.The team are, however, more than happy to give us a tour and tell us about their own experiences.David Adamson is our very informative tour guide.The -year-old, who was in the army for  years and thereafter the police for , has worked at the factory for the last seven years.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.deesidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"At the helm...Charlie Pelling, manager of Lady Haigs Poppy Factory in Edinburgh, is preparing for a temporary move to Redford Barracks, which will start on November . \"  \"  Armistice : Lady Haig Poppy Factory is on the move viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"He said: “I finished with the police on the Saturday and started working here on the Monday and have been here ever since.“I’m now one of the official tour guides and I thoroughly enjoy it.“It’s been fascinating for me finding out about the history of the poppy and what it means to people.“Most of the stuff up on the walls has been presented to us by visitors and military organisations.“Around  school kids also visit every year and they love every minute of it.“It can be like herding cats at times but they always ask really interesting questions and we’re often surprised by the knowledge they have.“We show them how to make the poppies and tell them that our numbers are on the back of each box sold.“Soyou ever see school children looking at the back of the box, they’re looking for our numbers – mine is .”On a whistletop tour, we discover how the poppies are printed and cut out on  year old printing presses – left in the building when the Lady Haig Poppy Factory relocated from the grounds of Whitefoord House in  to the city’s Warriston Road.Lapel poppies may no longer be cut by hand but each one is still handcrafted.The paper from which the poppies is made arrives into the factory in large rolls.These are passed through the cutting and pressing machine and the poppy petals cut to size.Then the team add the distinctive ribbing which makes the Scottish poppy unique, before they start assembling them.Around one million stick on poppies and four million green stem poppies are produced each year.And visitors are always given a chance to make their own which school children, in particular, love, as testied by the many letters and posters on the walls.David, who has three children and seven grandchildren, added: “The bairns lap this place up.“They love making the poppies then they go back to school, do a project and send in posters or letters for our walls. We’ve not got a lot of space but we try to display as many as we can.“Instilling a sense of pride in the poppy in future generations is one of the things I love most about working here.”David and his colleagues also display personal mementoes, some of which serve to remind them of just how much their work means.Thomas McPhillipswas a Royal Corps of Signals radio operator in the s.His grandfather, William Anthony, a Lance Corporal with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, died at Passchendaele on July , .And a picture of his cousin’s son, Gary O’Donnell from South Queensferry, now also takes pride of place on his desk.He explained: “Gary was killed trying to defuse a Taliban bomb in Afghanistan in September  he was only .“In  he was awarded the George Medal for bravery demonstrated in Iraq. “He was awarded another George Medal postumously in March . He is one of the few soldiers to receive two.“I keep Gary’s picture on my desk, just in case my head ever goes down a bit.“That rarely happens here, though. It’s a lovely place to work. “I’ve been here for  years and it’s just like being back in the barracks. I love it.”One of the youngest recruits, Danny Renowden joined the army when he was just  years old.He served for seven years, including a tour in Afghanistan in  which later resulted in his medical discharge in January  due to post traumatic stress disorder .The -year-old initially applied for a job with PoppyScotland which put him in touch with the Poppy Factory.He said: “I emailed in my CV and, within a matter of minutes, Charlie Pelling, the factory manager, replied asking me to come in.“He offered me a job right away. I’ve been here, part-time, since December .”It’s the perfect fit for Danny who, for health reasons, wanted to ease back into employment.He said: “It’s giving me the routine that I really needed but in a workplace that feels like second nature.“Everyone has been in the military so that camaraderie is already there.“They are a great bunch eventhey do like winding me up because I’m originally from Cornwall!”The factory’s flexibility is ideal for dad-of-one Danny who hopes, in future, to help veterans who find themselves in his position.He added: “I’d like to go into counselling veterans but I need to go back to college.“I joined up when I was  and only have my high school education. So I’m looking into doing part-time or night classes, while working here.“For me, the factory has given me back some of the confidence I needed to consider a new career.

We set up a Dinky Doctors Facebook page and word started to spread about it, there was a real buzz.”Dinky Doctors is an interactive show that introduces Dr Potty and some of his unwell teddy bear patients.Dr Potty will ask youngsters for help while teaching them vital first aid skills.Mitch said: “Adults see first aid training as a part of their work but with Dinky Doctors the children will see it as play and it is a great way to teach interactive learning through play.”Business assistant Michelle Mitchell added: “By teaching children first aid from a young age they grow up with no fear and dealing with medical situations won’t be as frightening, and as they get older any first aid skills they pick up will add to the knowledge they already have.”Cheryl hopes the Dinky Doctor scheme will help some youngsters choose a medical career path in the future.She explained: “In a typical class at least two or three of those children could end up working for the NHS and that could be because they had a Dinky Doctors session and really enjoyed it.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish. The Minister should stop dragging her feet and start delivering for the industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They also campaign to improve their lives and remember the fallen.Mark Bibbey, chief executive of Poppyscotland said: “Members of the Armed Forces are often based far away from home so an initiative like this which offers a signicant discount on travel must be applauded. This will also make Loganair’s extensive network more accessible to those who have served, and to Forces families too.It underlines Loganair’s commitment to supporting the Armed Forces community and is just the latest way in which they have demonstrated this.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But budget leader councillor Alister Mackinnon said uncertainty would remain until the Scottish Government budget in mid-December.Cllr Mackinnon said: \"The exact gap is very uncertain as although the UK governmentrsquos budget has been announced, we will not have the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget and grant settlement figures until mid-December. We are hopeful however that the Scottish Government will pass on the additional money.\"Over the period   to   the Highland Council has already had to implement budget savings of pound. million and council tax rises of % in each of the last two years in order to deliver a balanced budget. We have managed to do this without compulsory redundancies and at the same time have still invested in important projects across the Highlands ndash such as new schools, roads and free wi-fi.\"A major concern is the councilrsquos financial reserves which are at their \"lowest levels in recent history\" requiring immediate action.\"We were estimating a pound million overspend in quarter one ndash but our officers have been working extremely hard to reduce this and we are now predicting a more positive out-turn with an overspend of pound. million,\" Cllr Mackinnon said. \"This is not ideal, but moving in the right direction. We do however have the risk of the cost of another harsh winter ahead of us.\"The council is now focusing on income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies to protect essential services.Cllr Mackinnon added: \"There will be very hard decisions to make as we plan for a reduced budget over the next three years and it is vital that we involve the public, our staff and all members in the choices we make.\"Depute budget leader councillor Matthew Reiss said: \"This is an opportunity to listen to what is important to people, to reshape our priorities and to focus our resources on improving lives.\"I strongly encourage everyone to get involved in this and make your voices heard.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities. Our focus will be on directing our resources to those areas which will give us the best outcomes and deliver value for money.\"Depute budget leader Matthew Reiss said: \"It will not be easy to find more savings on top of those we have already made. Income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies become even more vital in this context in order to protect essential services and we do not have the luxury of the signicant reserves we once had to give us any room for manoeuvre.\"It is undoubtedly the case that there will be very hard decisions to make and we will begin a process of engagement to help us make the right decisions and do the best we can.\"Monday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In a bright apricot top and carefully made up, she’s surrounded by our favourite foodies as she presents another serving of The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice, the spin off from the ratings busting TV show. She couldn’t be more rehabilitated from the days of her vilication as the man-hating, acerbic lesbian stand-up she never actually was, to the favourite aunty now welcomed into the nation’s sitting rooms to serve up their feelgood comfort food TV. “I think I’m seen as a bit more fluffy now,” says the -year-old in her pleasantly dry laconic drawl. “A lot of the press thought when I got married, ‘oh she can’t be a man hating lesbian after all’”, she says, sounding asshe’s scuffing the toes of her Docs on the ground as she drags herself all the way to double home economics. As for the sartorial makeover, Brand is happy to ditch her matching black T-shirt and leggings for pastels on TV because “they make me. No, they don’t, but my thing is to fight bigger battles. I wouldn’t select colour for myself butsomeone  does, I’ll wear it. And they do your make-up too,” she says, sounding pleased, as she loves a bit of lippy, and an aubergine tint in her hair. Because despite the rebranding, Brand has retained her ability to subvert expectations, as well as her feminist or left-wing principles, along with her talent for devastating one-liners. She’s been making us laugh for  years, since Channel ’s late night comedy show Saturday Live in the late s, after she’d already made her name as the heckle-proof deadpan ‘Sea Monster’ on London’s comedy circuit. Her own shows Jo Brand’s Big Splash and Jo Brand Through The Cakehole followed and she became a regular list on Have I Got News For You, QI, Would I Lie To You and Countdown. Moving into writing, she penned and starred in NHS comedy Getting On, for which she won a Bafta to add to her four British Comedy Awards and most recently, social services satire Damned. Her several books include an autobiography and novels, one of which she adapted into this year’s film The More You Ignore Me, starring Sheridan Smith. And there’s her latest book, the amusingly useful le guide, Born Lippy: How to Do Female. All of which amounts to the sort of career that leads to you being called ‘national treasure’, so how does she feel about that  “It’s not my favourite thing because it limits your behaviour. I don’t hate it, it’s quite funny, but I would reserve judgement because I don’t want to behave like a national treasure for the rest of my le. I might want to do things that don’t fit into that category…”Such as… back in the Extra Slice studio it’s dessert week and Jo is revisiting the contestant’s chocolate spheres. The trick is to pour hot chocolate sauce over and watch it melt daintily, but an impatient Brand speeds things along with a tenderising mallet, inadvertently also smashing the white china plate underneath. “Sorry,” she says, unconvincingly, as the guests and studio audience cheer her on. This national treasure still has an irreverent bite.Brand loves presenting Bake Off: An Extra Slice despite admitting thatwe shouted ‘Show Us Your Bakes!’ at her, she’d come up with... “not much – a very plain sponge or a rhubarb crumble. The problem I have is making it look nice and Bake Off is as much about art as baking.” Did she take the hosting gig for the comic potential of soggy bottoms, cracks and buns then “To be honest, I did it because they asked me, and I love its happy audience, funny  and – unintentionally terrying sometimes – audience baking. And I liked the format. It’s a bit like Have I Got News For You, presenting, with a  of funny people and an audience.“I’m doing another HIGNFY soon, hosting this time, and it’s like promotion, being a grown up,” she says.The  show allowed Brand to demonstrate her more reasonable than raging approach to feminism when she calmly reprimanded a dismissive Ian Hislop and the all-male  for downplaying sexual harassment in the House of Commons, by saying, “For women,you’re constantly being harassed, that builds up and wears you down.”“I really like Ian a lot and have known him for years and I was really surprised, but I felt I had to say something. Because it’s a creeping thing, a collective set of experiences that wear you down. It’s not a one off touching your bum, or ‘you look gorgeous’, it builds up.” As the mother of teenage daughters, Maisie and Eliza, Brand is used to being uncool, but for once they were impressed. “They loved it because I was trending on Twitter for three months. And I’m pleased it got the attention it did. My instinct was to speak quietly because it’s such a cliché about feminists, that they’re just a load of shouty women with no sense of humour.” At which point it seems apposite to insert one of the jokes from Born Lippy: How many Feminists Does it Take to Change a Lightbulb Do it yourself, you lazy bastard.Things have changed for women in comedy too, for the better according to Brand as attitudes have moved on. “For a long time male comedy was described as being lots of dferent styles – Eddie Izzard did surreal, others did puns – and women were just ‘women doing comedy’, but these days women are allowed to have all kinds of dferent personalities and styles.” Away from the telly, Brand is back on stage and heading for Edinburgh, with Birmingham Repertory Theatre’s Nativity! The Musical. Thanks to Maisie and Eliza, she has been to her share of nativity plays and is a big fan of the Nativity! films. “What you do is totally focus on what your child is playing, eventhey’re a rock or sheep, and for my money, the more mistakes the better.“I’m playing a newspaper critic who starts off cynical and is swept away with the show because the kids are so great.” Being self-deprecating, Brand is downplaying her own starring role in a school nativity, when she played not ‘Bethlehem’, as she’s claimed, but Mary. “Well, I remember virtually nothing about it, apart from wearing a white head thing and a blue dress. It was the s and traditional – no space ships – they didn’t give Mary an awful lot to say. Mary doesn’t say a word in the Bible, it’s all Joseph. And she was very pregnant, wasn’t she, so she’d probably just have said ‘My God I’m tired.’”Born in South London in July  to an engineer and social worker, with an older and younger brother, Josephine Grace Brand grew up in Kent then moved schools at , hated it and started to skive, smoke and drink. In Born Lippy she doesn’t hold back describing her headstrong teen years with stories of the time her dad punched her heroin addict boyfriend, or when he threw all her clothes on a bonfire after he and her mother caught underage Brand coming out of Emmanuelle, stoned, accompanying seven men, the incident that prompted her leaving the family home. Moving in with her posh heroin addict boyfriend, she went on the pill and put on four stone, becoming the spiky haired, thick-skinned ‘Sea Monster’, an alternative comedian who faced down the hecklers with her deadpan drawl. Ask Brandshe regrets leaving home as a teenager, she demurs.“No… I would say I probably did the right thing actually because I don’t think things would have been any better at home and to some extent, my leaving added to the weight that made my father get some help. I needed to get out just because we were in one of those awful relationships where you can’t work it out and be calm.” While honing her comedy she trained as a psychiatric nurse and worked at an emergency department where knives, guns and abuse were a reality and made the clubs look tame. “When you’re a stand-up comedian and people are off their heads, you get a lot of abuse. But the manic phase of bipolar disorder is way more eloquent than the average drunk bellowing ‘f*** off you fat cow’”. Brand’s ten years working as a psychiatric nurse provided her with background for her sitcoms satirising le at the sharp end of the caring professions and she acknowledges that her father’s struggle with depression may have influenced her original choice of career.Set in a geriatric ward the BBC Four series Getting On, which she co-wrote and co-starred in three series of, was directed by Peter Capaldi and did for the NHS what The Thick Of It did for politics, as well as winning her a Bafta in  for Best TV Comedy Performance. Meanwhile Damned, the second series of which screened this year on Channel  is set in a social services office, and stars Brand, and her friends Alan Davies and co-writer Morwenna Banks.“They say write about what you know then you don’t have to spend a lot of time researching to make it relevant. That’s why I haven’t done any dramas about scaffolding. I stick to stuff I do know about, mental health, nursing, social work, and not many people are doing stuff about that. I have experienced a lot of le. My favourite comedy is the kind where you see that, where people have had proper jobs before they came into it. It adds something.” Mental illnessis also dealt with in The More You Ignore Me, a novel she turned into a film, set in s rural England. Starring Sheridan Smith as Gina, a schizophrenic mum who is hospitalised after becoming obsessed with a local weatherman, it also features Mark Addy, Sheila Hancock, Ricky Tomlinson and Brand herself.“The central thing is how unglamorous it is to be ill like that, and its impact on the family. In the s it was something that was kept private, shameful. My dad suffered depression from his teenage years and didn’t seek help until his mid-fties. It’s unrecognisable now in comparison, and the power of the person seeking help has risen exponentially. “A few of my friends who are psychiatric nurses saw it and they’re hard-bitten cynical people, so to make them cry and laugh too, I was satisfied. I couldn’t believe I had the power to move people with something I’d written.” Her latest book Born Lippy: How to Do Female is moving too, as well as funny, and most of all useful. A collection of all the things Brand wishes she’d known, things she’s learnt, and things she hopes for the future, among the chapters are, How to Manage a Bully, Your Family And How To Survive It, Having Fun, Not Having Fun, How Not to Fall in Love, Feminism, a Rebranding and Staying Sane.There’s also handy practical advice for you to try. Can’t get on with your toxic family  Lower your expectations. People making you unhappy  Ultimately, you can walk away. Nervous at parties  Try some ice-breakers: “What’s the most violent incident you’ve ever witnessed ” Or “What’s the worst lie you’ve ever told ” Find yourself confronted with a flasher  Shout “That looks like a penis only smaller,” and for women faced with that old favourite: “You obviously hate men,” try “No I don’t, it’s just you”, while “You need a good shag”, can be dispensed with “I’ll look where then.”Hitchhiking alone at night, falling in love with a heroin addict or smashing up an abusive driver’s windscreen when you have PMT  Read Brand’s own experience and it might put you off. Although she’s conflicted about that last one. “I’m not advocating violence,” she says, “butyou do suffer from PMT be aware you might go there one day. I used to control it  per cent of the time, and when I didn’t, I tried to appreciate it. And it was always towards things, never people, and that’s not quite so bad.“The book is all stuff that was familiar to me, that happened to me or was interesting to me. Hence the lack of a chapter on motor mechanics. I wrote it for my daughters in a way.“If you’re a comedian rule number one is ‘be funny’. There are serious bits but a lot of it is tongue in cheek. I don’t like to give advice and I think the best way is to tell people stories about what went wrong for you and say,you can avoid doing that you’ll be better off.” Brand is keen to write more novels – “so I don’t have to get dressed” – but hasn’t lost her love of stand-up. The problem is being away too much from the South London home she shares with husband of  years, Bernie Bourke, a psychiatric nurse, her daughters and cats Louis and Dotty. Script-writing and TV work suit her at the moment, but she’s never been one for five or ten year plans. “As things come up I think do I want to do it or not ” she says.And she decided she did want to do the Edinburgh and London legs of the Nativity! The Musical tour as she “likes Scotland”. Speaking of which, Brand was one of the  celebrities who signed an open letter in theto the people of Scotland urging them to stay in the UK in . Does she still think that, in the light of the Brexit vote “Well, I think so, just because I like Scotland,” she says. “But to be honest, I don’t blame you for wanting to leave because I wouldI was in Scotland. You have policies that are good on health, such as free care for the elderly, and it’s more caring. “As for Brexit, I would support another referendum because I think we are much better suited being in Europe than on our own, but it looks asaround half of the people are delighted by Brexit, and that’s quite a dficult thing to live with. “A bit of me thinks ‘you’ve made your bed, see what happens when you haven’t got enough people for the health service, doctors, teachers…’ Let’s see what happens. I think we are in the last chance saloon andwe do leave, I’m not sure how it’s going to be,” she says, sounding resigned. Butanyone should be tempted to say to her, “Cheer up love, it may never happen!” I refer you to one of her handy general purpose put-downs, “Keep talking and it will.”@JanetChristieJo Brand will appear in Nativity!

Though Jo Johnson was careful not to take too many potshots at Boris, his resignation last week as a minister and demand for a second EU referendum could scarcely have been a more powerful indictment of the former Foreign Secretary#s reckless egotism or a clearer attempt to separate himself from his elder sibling.In this, he was successful: his explanation for his actions, set out in a y blog post, possessed an integrity Boris wouldn’t recogniseit ran up to him in the street yelling: “This is the way you behaveyou have an ounce of decency, you craven, self-entitled buffoon.” The gulf between the two was reinforced when another Johnson – their sister Rachel – tweeted: “Am hugely proud of my honourable and principled brother, Jo, who has put the interests of the country ahead of his political career.” The “as opposed to my unprincipled brother, Boris, who shafted the country, then legged it” addendum was tacit, but everyone understood it, nonetheless. Jo’s blog post is a clear-eyed,devastating analysis of the scale of the crisis facing the UK as a result of Brexit and of the failure of “statecraft” that brought us to this position. In it, the former transport minister says the “choice” being presented to the British people – between Theresa May’s fudgeand a “no deal” Brexit – is a choice between “vassalage and chaos”.Despite being a Remainer, Jo says he had hoped the government would make a success of Brexit, delivering the vision of a post-EU Britain voters were promised before the referendum. Now, however, he understands that the notion of a great nation freed from the shackles of Brussels was a mass delusion, and believes the country must be given another chance to vote on the reality.“To those who say that is an affront to democracy given the  result, I ask this: ‘Is it more democratic to rely on a three-year-old vote based on what an idealised Brexit might offer, or to have a vote based on what we know it does actually entail ” he wrote.Of course everything is relative. Before we get carried away by Jo Johnson’s clarity, let us remember that this is the man who lost his job as universities minister for appointing Toby Young – purveyor of misogynistic and homophobic tweets – to the board of a universities regulator.Equally, the younger Johnson may have seen the light, but his epiphany is somewhat belated. Though others have been measuring the depth of the abyss at the edge of which we are hovering ever since the Leave campaign was victorious, it has taken the approaching Commons voteto focus his mind.Nevertheless, set beside Boris, Jo is a model of decorum. He stuck by the Prime Minister while she tried to deliver a Brexit neither of them wanted. And – at the point when sticking by her was no longer compatible with his conscience – he exited with dignity, eschewing the opportunity to make her the scapegoat for other people’s failings.Compare his behaviour to that of his Big Bro, who hawked the country’s future for a shot at power, and, when it all went wrong, blamed everyone but himself. Boris is no keener on Theresa May’s plan than Jo, yet he would rather see the country plunged into darkness than offer the electorate the opportunity to record that they were sold a pup by a bunch of blaggers. It is dficult to believe they share the same gene pool.Jo shines because he is surrounded by intellectual pygmies: people like Dominic Raab, who makes David “no notes” Davis look competent. You might have thought Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley had hit peak idiocy when she admitted she hadn’t known people in the Six Counties vote along constitutional lines. But Raab apparently has problems grasping the concept that Britain is an island. Last week, he revealed that, until recently, he did not fully appreciate the importance of the Dover-Calais crossing for UK trade. This is odd. After all, in June – a month before he replaced Davis as Brexit Secretary – it emerged the civil service had drawn up a Doomsday scenario of the pandemonium that would unfold in the event of no-deal Brexit. It included the prediction that the port of Dover would collapse on day one, that supermarkets in Scotland and Cornwall would run out of food within a couple of days and that hospitals would run out of vital supplies within a month.But then you only have to watch footage of Raab failing to understand the basics at the first meeting of the Exiting The EU select committee back in  to get a sense of his cerebral limitations. Then, Raab declared himself “jarred and bemused” by the idea that Brexit might create more rather than less bureaucracy. Sir Simon Fraser, former director-general, Europe and Globalisation, can be seen explaining it all to him with admirableslightly strained patience. Like a teacher dealing with an academically challenged pupil, he finds concrete examples to make his points more digestible. Let’s look at what might happenwe were to leave the customs union, he says. One corollary of that might be that there would need to be new regulatory arrangements put in place and checks on goods crossing the border. This could potentially create a heavier bureaucratic burden. It’s no use, though despite his best efforts Raab remains “bemused”.With this inability to take in information, it’s no wonder we are where we are. The country is being led by politicians who struggle with the simplest political concepts. How could they ever have been relied upon to steer their way through the trickiest negotiations of our time Referenda used to be sneered at ordinary people could not be expected to understand the ins and outs of complicated decisions. That’s what politicians were for. We voted them in because we trusted them to act responsibly on our behalf. But that requires them to be insightful, hard-working and with the best interests of the country at heart. No-one in the current cabinet is of this calibre.On the th anniversary of the First World War Armistice, it seems fair to say: we may not be a nation of lions, but we are most assuredly being led by donkeys. And duplicitous donkeys at that.Jo Johnson is right. Those donkeys – including Boris – sold us: “a  prospectus, a fantasy set of promises that have been shown up for what they were.” There is only one way to deal with this con trick democratically and it is to give voters a second chance to have their say on the cold, hard truth.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4827362.1541792842!/image/image.jpg","title":"upkilting isn t a laughing matter jane bradley","story":"Kiltmaker Howie Nicholsby reveals to Jane Bradley that he#s had a number of unpleasant encounters over the years, after relunctantly agreeing to allow a French model to apparently peek under his kilt during a PR stunt for the Mango clothing retailer.Would you look under a man’s kilt without permission  While you, personally, may not, there are plenty who would. Indeed, it has long been a risk for kilt wearers that they can be subject to unsolicited peeking, questioning about what is worn underneath – or even groping.Yet, while campaigners have long fought, quite rightly, for “up-skirting” to be banned, it has somehow been perfectly acceptable – nay welcome, even – for a woman to feel free to do whatever she likes when a man is wearing a kilt.Earlier this week, I reported on a stooshie over an advert produced by clothing retailer Mango. In it, the model, Jeanne Dumas, apparently a Parisian ‘it girl’, embarks on a visit to Scotland wearing the brand’s garments. As well as a lot of scampering around in the Scottish countryside with a dog, she graces the streets of Edinburgh with her presence, only pausing on her whirlwind fashionista tour to peek cheekily up the kilt of a Scotsman, who happens to be standing handily on the street.Broadcast on social media, the ad sparked outrage among people who complained that this action was “not appropriate”.“Mango,” said one, “are you really condoning lting up stranger’s skirts ! It’s not acceptable, whether it’s a lady’s skirt or a guy’s kilt.”Another argued that it was akin to sexual harrassment. “So odd that in a world where we campaign against ‘upskirting’ andconsider having their skirt lted to be sexual harassment, that a woman looking up a man’s kilt is shown as playful and jokey,” she said.: English upskirting ban ‘will also apply to kilts’As I watched the ad, I realised I recognised the chap who was the victim of this violation. It was none other than legendary Edinburgh kiltmaker Howie Nicholsby, who has worn a kilt every day for the past  years.I tried to contact Howie, who I assumed would laugh off the incident with a tongue-in-cheek comment – after all, he had not looked too traumatised on the video and had presumably given his consent to appear in the ad – but when I finally managed to have a chat with him after he ed from holiday, I found that he did, indeed, feel quite strongly about the practice.In fact, it turned out, he had allowed Ms Dumas to lt his kilt, but under some duress. He told me that he had actually tried to explain to the film crew that he didn’t feel comfortable with her peeking under his kilt, but that the language barrier, combined with a lack of cultural understanding, meant he found it dficult to get across. And after a long day’s filming, Howie was too exhausted to argue.“It was a pleasure to work with the Mango film crew, but they were foreign and they just didn’t get what I was saying about this,” he explains. “I tried to tell them that I wasn’t comfortable with it, that it was the equivalent of up-skirting, but they didn’t understand. It had been a long day and in the end, I just went with it. With hindsight, perhaps I shouldn’t have.”Howie estimates he has experienced at least one incident a year over the past two decades of what I am going to refer to as “up-kilting” with which he has not been happy. “There have been a lot of experiences, often late night in a bar, some in Scotland and some where,” he says. “There have been drunk -year-old women who probably should have known better and on occasion, even some men.”: Leader comment: Scotland’s upskirting law is not fit for purposeOne particularly unpleasant incident occurred in Newcastle, where a group of four women pinned him against the wall in a bar while he was on a stag night as their friend forced her hand up his kilt.“I usually wear underpants, but on that occasion it was a stag do, so I was commando,” he remembers. “I’d used an old rugby trick of putting a fair bit of Vaseline down there to avoid chafing and when the woman grabbed me, she looked at me asI was the one who was disgusting beacuse she’d got a handful of Vaseline. It was asI’d assaulted her, when it was the other way around. I was standing there, thinking ‘Jesus Christ, how is this OK ’”Up-skirting was made a specic offence in Scotland in , which refers to operating equipment, such as a camera, under people’s clothing. A separate up-skirting bill is currently being passed south of the Border, which will, it has been claimed, specically protect kilt-wearers, as well as women in skirts.While groping of any kind is obviously unacceptable and could be classed as an offence under sexual assult laws, socially, a woman sticking her hand up a man’s kilt is often seen as a bit of a laugh. Unlike women in the same situation, men are expected to almost enjoy the experience, which Howie says is most definitely not the case.“Of course, some guys are quite happy when it’s an attractive woman, but it has to be seen as under the same laws which protect women,” says Howie. “It has to be regarded in the same way as up-skirting.”And he’s right. We can’t argue that men shouldn’t look up a woman’s skirt – which obviously they shouldn’t – while watching a major brand do exactly the same in reverse.

The medieval centre of worship has been a haven since its consecration in the th century. Outside its Norman walls, wars have raged and rebellions have been staged, yet it has always been a place where anguish and loss are salved, and hope and courage regained. How fitting then, as the echoes of the First World War slip from living memory, it was the venue for Scotland’s national service marking the centenary of the Armistice.The carnage of war has long been a theme addressed from its pulpit. It was here in November , as German forces looted and burned synagogues, that the Reverend A. Nevile Davidon asked people to keep faith that the world would rediscover the path of peace. Three years later, the same minister, speaking as German forces besieged Moscow, bemoaned how we had “drted on in complacency until our civilisation and homes were in deadly danger.” And it was here, this evening, that the Right Reverend Susan Brown, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, sent a packed congregation out into a mild autumn night with simple farewell blessing. The green of the poppy represents the shoots of peace, she said, but all of us must nourish them. Over , people attended the thoughtful and erse service, which fused the stoicism and humour of Sir Harry Lauder with the wisdom of Mahatma Gandi. With music from Runrig and Ivor Novello, as well as the prayers of Rabidranath Tagore, the Bengali polymath, it rightly drew on international influences to recall a war which reshaped the world. It began at pm, when the lights dimmed and Andy Cant, an Orcadian fiddler standing high above the congregation, his kilt shrouded by the purple and yellow hues of the stained glass East Window, played Glimmers of Goodbyes, a beautully restrained air. The Glasgow Cathedral Choir then sang Laurence Binyon’s For the Fallen before uniting with the National Youth Choir of Scotland for an uplting rendition of Pack Up Your Troubles In Your Old Kit Bag and Keep The Home Fires Burning, songs which once provided respite from the terror and suffering, and optimism and joy when such qualities were scarce .In a show of the multigenerational thread running through the service, three generations of the Gray family - its roots spanning Scotland and Germany - were among those to read the WW Scotland Armistice Centenary prayer.Those listening on included Princess Royal and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who spoke afterwards of the importance of leaving “a legacy for future generations on the history and horrors” of the war. But the service belonged most of all to the descendants of the fallen. They included Robin Scott-Elliot, whose great grandfather, Lieutenant Colonel William Herbert Anderson, was killed in France. Lt Col Anderson’s three brothers were also lost to the war. Fittingly, a nave of the cathedral hosts a plaque in their memory. It is, like this evening’s service, a show of public honour and private grief.Also in attendance was Patrick Friell, whose great great grandfather, also Patrick, was in the Royal Horse Artillery. He was only  when the joined the Army. His great great grandson, just two years older, is keenly aware of the price he paid. Singing in the National Your Choir of Scotland as part of the service was, he said, a small way of honouring his family.“It means a lot to me,” he reflected ahead of the service. “We’re so blessed to live the lives we have today. If it wasn’t for those who lost theirs, we wouldn’t have that.”Elsewhere, the narrator, JJ Chalmers, an Afghanistan veteran who suffered severe injuries after being blown up by an IED in Afghanistan, spoke of the conflict’s grand, contradictory themes, and how a “harrowing, destructive” force could not just ide, but unite.Professor Norman Drummond, chair of the Scottish Commemorations Panel and WW Scotland, gave an eloquent address, “While attitudes may change,” he said, “certain values in le are timeless, and there to sustain us.”But it was one of the final passages which proved the most moving. Cara Lucas, a -year-old from Peebles whose Royal Marine Commando father was killed in Afghanistan, read St. Francis of Assisi’s poignant prayer. The torch was handed over to a new generation. Has it been a century already  Another will pass soon enough. But the people here tonight will ensure no one forgets.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing. The bans, which were pretty lenient in any case, should stay. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"16 murrayston lerwick ","story":"OFFERS OVER £, Murrayston has recently been extended and completely renovated to a high standard providing a modern two bedroomed house with high quality fittings throughout.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block

protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

A gt in your will can ensure that your most loved charities can continue to make a dference for many years to come.Will to Give member USPCA We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our valuesEimear McCooey, Will to Give Chair, agreed: ldquoWe plan for lersquos major milestones births, weddings, anniversaries but most of us shy away from talking about and planning for death - yet it is the one thing that is guaranteed to happen to us all!I strongly believe that talking openly about the future can help ensure we have a better experience when it eventually does happen, and one of the things we can plan for is the legacy we want to leave behind.Making a will is important because it gives you the peace of mind of knowing that your wishes will be respected and the ones you love are looked after, whether that be family, friends or even a well-loved charity. I am leaving a small gt to the charities I care for in my will.Will to Give member the USPCA added its appreciation of the value of legacy gts with Brendan Mullan, Chief Executive, explaining:ldquoThe USPCA was established in  and since then the activities of the USPCA have evolved to meet the ever-changing needs of animals.By deciding to leave us a gt in your will you are helping us protect all animals across Northern Ireland.Legacies are extremely important to the USPCA and without these the charity would not be able to deliver our vital services to animals. We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our values.Will to Give added: Anyone can leave a gt in their will. It really doesnrsquot matter what size ndash small or large, every gt is greatly received.It is very easy to leave a gt in yourwill to charity ndash in fact, hundreds of people do it every year in Northern Ireland. We will always advise you to speak with your solicitor to have your will drafted correctly. Your solicitor should be familiar with how to write such a gt into your will.Further informationWill to Give is a charity dedicated to promoting charitable gts in Wills in Northern Ireland. With almost  charity members, representing all sizes and causes, Will to Give is making steady progress in raising awareness of the signicance and positive impact associated with leaving a charitable Will gt.Join Will to Give @WilltoGive on Facebook and Twitter #changethefuture and share with Will to Give what you wish the future to hold for your chosen charity.Email info@willtogive.org for more information or visit Will to Give on their website: www.willtogive.org."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8700094.1541778907!/image/image.jpg","title":"local mum hails go for it programme after she achieves life goal of opening her own business","story":"Helen McBurney from Ballymena explained that she always had an interested in beauty and owning her own business was a le goal. with Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

The desire to produce the right deal can be superseded by the perceived need to produce a deal.This is why all negotiations need measures to prevent this, a check mechanism and preferably multiple ones.With the current UK-EU negotiations, there are two identiable check mechanisms or lines of defence to concluding an unwise agreement - Cabinet and Parliament.Last week, I wrote to the Prime Minister outlining broad concerns about the direction of travel.This could be discerned from shts in public comments, private engagements and what was being briefed in London, Dublin and Brussels. I wrote in the hope of reassurance and with the desire that an acceptable deal for us all was within grasp. Instead, I received confirmation that we were right to be concerned.If what is outlined in the reply is the type of deal the Prime Minister intends to conclude, then the DUP could not support a deal which annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.Indeed, many others in Westminster and throughout the United Kingdom, true to their commitments to respect the referendum, the national interest and to the Union, have contacted me to voice their concern.Equally we cannot be assured that this current proposal will be the final deal. The European Union price for agreement appears to rise daily whether it be our fishing industry or an ever growing list of level playing field commitments.Last December when this backstop appeared we were deeply concerned. This is why we sought and got the paragraph  assurance of a democratic protection against a sea border.In March, the EU made clear its intention to ignore paragraph  and rewrite paragraph . We took no solace from our predictions being correct but we did take solace that it was universally rejected.Neither the passage of time nor the application of pressure has made it any more acceptable now.The new idea of a UK customs arrangement does not appear to be a genuinely UK-wide offer but a GB offer and an NI offer badged as one - Northern Ireland in THE EU customs territory and GB in A customs union.The real intent is not to solve any land border issues in Ireland but to handcuff the UK to the EU, with the EU holding the keys. The United Kingdom would be trapped.The focus on customs arrangements should never blind anyone to a sea border of regulations.We certainly did not forget it and why we raised it repeatedly and consistently.It was something the Prime Minister ruled out after Salzburg: \"…no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree.\"The limited and low level checks that exist at the moment in Belfast and Larne do not compare to what wo uld be the future arrangement.Key industries in Northern Ireland would be subject to rules and standards with no democratic input to them. Rules would be made in Brussels rather than Stormont or Westminster.The regulatory sea border with some caveats in the Prime Ministers letter is still a sea border.This is not haggling about checks but preventing Northern Ireland from being left in the EU with the Northern Ireland Assembly reduced to vassal status or the devolution settlement torn up.Our most important trade flows are to be hampered and regulated by the EU. Despite all of this a Northern Ireland specic backstop still remains.The Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson has rightly warned: \"…Northern Ireland would erge unconsciously from the United Kingdom against the expressed will of its people - it would also feed Scottish nationalist demands that a similar ergent arrangement be made for Scotland.\"The DUP does not stand alone against this proposal. We appreciate the support from MPs across the United Kingdom.We are ready to stand with those in Cabinet and in Parliament to work for a better deal. One which works for the whole United Kingdom. We want the referendum result to be respected and the entire United Kingdom to leave together with a sensible deal.Arlene Foster is leader of the DUP"},{"url":null,"title":"acts of remembrance across northern ireland for centenary","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A th victim, Ronnie Hill, slipped into a coma two days afterwards and died  years later.A number of families of the bomb victims were present in Enniskillen for the ceremony.Noel Trimble played the last post earlier at Enniskillen Castle on the bugle which sounded the charge of the th Ulster Division at the Battle of the Somme in .

There was a sense that commemoration of the young Irishmen who died in the Somme or Gallipoli was a political declaration, or a marker of community identity.”“In recent times, and as we have marked the centenaries of the events of that decade, we have seen something very dferent. We have seen leadership and scholarship and sensitivity and generosity.”Enniskillen prepares for its act of Remembrance at the cenotaph on Belmore Street. pic uaQMjMh— Rebecca BlackNovember , The emphasis will see a moment of reflection rather than an act of remembrance and instead of wreaths, several volumes of Ireland’s Memorial Records will be laid at a field altar. The books will be borne by four people all of whom have at least one family member who was killed in the war and is named in the memorial records.At sunset, a lantern will be borne out from the cathedral as the fallen are remembered.The service in Belfast is set to take place at the same time as services in Dublin, Glasgow and Cardf and ahead of the service at Westminster Abbey on Sunday evening.Other acts of remembrance took place across the Northern Ireland, including one on board the Royal Navy warship HMS Duncan, which is in Belfast for the weekend.The Royal Naval Association held its annual remembrance service parade on Great Victoria Street at .am. Memorial events have also taken place on beaches, including Murlough Beach, Co Down, Portstewart Strand and Downhill Beach, Co Londonderry.

In doing so, we join with people across these islands and across the continent of Europe, and worldwide. An event of impossible human destruction is now commemorated collectively in a powerful symbol of our shared commitment to peace.On this island, it has not always been so. As Irish Parliamentary Party MP Stephen Gwynn said: \"When the time came to rejoice over the wars ending, was there anything more tragic than the position of men who had gone out by the thousands to confront the greatest military power ever known in history, who had fought the war, and won the war, and now looked at each other with doubtful eyes \"That doubtfulness foreshadowed later times when there was too much forgetfulness, neglect or ambivalence in too many quarters about the place of those men and women in the history of this island.However, in the last decades I believe we have seen this transformed. Approaching the centenaries of the last several years, it was by no means clear that we would navigate them in a way that paid proper respect to the part they had in shaping the history, traditions, identities and lived experience of all the people of this island. It was by no means inevitable that we would mark these moments in a way that brought us closer together and gave us a better understanding of one another.Now we can look back and remember together the quiet dignity and shared purpose that characterised the high ceremonies of state of the last number of years. We remember President McAleese and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth side by side and bowing their heads in respect in both the Garden of Remembrance and in Islandbridge. We remember President Michael D Higgins laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier in Westminster Abbey during his State visit. We remember the Taoiseach and Prince William together honouring the memories of the th Ulster and th Irish Division under the round tower of the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Messines,  decades after those men fought shoulder to shoulder.Those moments, and the many others like them, were powerful. They opened up new spaces for everyone and inspired us to move into them. Where forgetfulness had built up, they reminded us. Where there was a sense that there was some unseen line that we perhaps should not cross, they swept it away. They left us closer together than we had been.However, they did not do so in isolation and in fact they did not lead the way. They built on the imaginative and patient work of a generation of people - professional and amateur historians, community leaders, church leaders, journalists, campaigners, and others from all parts of this island - who had refused to accept the articial parcelling out of a shared history to dferent groups and traditions, but wanted us to remember the lives and loss of the sons of Ulster, Leinster, Connacht and Munster all. They built on the work of all those who were not only open to new ideas and stories, new partners and audiences, but sought them out.I have been glad and proud that the Reconciliation Fund in my own department has been able in a small way to support dozens of projects in that spirit in Northern Ireland and where.As always, such transformation and such achievements must be built onthey are to be preserved at all. For the island of Ireland, the decade of centenaries of events that shaped our modern history continues. We will again have to rise to the challenge of remembering those events in our shared history in a way that is authentic and honest and rigorous and respectful of others. We have to do it in a way that enhances our understanding of our history, and our understanding of each other.We have to do all this while finding our way through the political challenges of the moment. I am confident we will. What we have done together in the last few years has shown that we can.In the Summer of , Tom Kettle wrote to his family promising, \" I live I mean to spend the rest of my le working for perpetual peace\". Eleven days later he was cut down while leading his men of the th Royal Dublin Fusiliers in what was described as a \"tempest of fire\" in Ginchy in France.We owe it to him and all the youth of his generation to take up that promise.Simon Coveney TD, Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade"},{"url":null,"title":"gabon president recovering in saudi arabia amid health speculation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The opposition claimed it was rigged.In , protesters took to the streets of the capital, Libreville, and the Parliament building was burned after Bongo’s opponent, Jean Ping, accused Bongo of vote-rigging.The EU, the United States, and France also expressed concerns about some of the results. Gabon’s constitutional court later upheld Bongo’s victory."},{"url":null,"title":"200 acre site outskirts derry identified preferred location new cemetery","story":"A site has been identied on the outskirts of Derry for a new municipal cemetery to service the city.The move comes after the Derry News revealed earlier this year that ‘shortlist’ of sites has been identied by Derry City and Strabane District Council to facilitate the development of a Municipal Cemetery.The Derry News has now learned that tests have been carried out at a site in the Killea areaon the outskirts of the city to determine whether it would be suitable.It is understood that the  acre site, which is situated close to a church, is now being considered as the preferred location for the new cemetery.The council had previously warned that the City Cemetery on Lone Moor Road, which was extended in , will reach full capacity within five years.There are currently more than , people buried in the cemetery.In February, the council issued an advert seeking expressions of interest from ‘owners of lands on the west bank of Derry City to facilitate the development of a Municipal Cemetery’.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe value of the tender was £, with the contract to last six months.In a statement issued to the Derry News, a spokesperson for the council would not confirmthe Killea site was being considered as the preferred location for the facility.“Council is currently progressing with plans to develop a new municipal cemetery within the wider cityside area of Derry city and recently received a number of submissions following a recent call for expressions of interest from those with lands available that could suit this purpose,” the spokesperson said.“A shortlist of sites has now been identied and further research is now taking place to scope the suitability of each site.”Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, the independent councillor Sean Carr, who also works as funeral director, welcomed the progress.“The Killea site is only three miles outside the city, and it has the capacity needed,” he said.“Even though it might be outside of the city itself, people should keep in mind that it’s only a ten minute drive away, and would provide enough burial space for decades.”He also called on the council to ensure that the development of a new crematorium remained a ‘priority’."},{"url":null,"title":"christmas alert santa arrive derrys city centre saturday morning","story":"Santa is arriving in Derry on Saturday morning.His first stop will see him arrive by train to Foyleside Shopping Centre at the top entrance at am.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe will then make his way to the Richmond Centre at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"date announced derry chritsmas lights switch santa special guests","story":"Derrys Christmas lights will be switched on later this month by Santa and some special helpers.Derry musicians Paul Casey and George Hutton will be performing their new song Christmas in Our Town.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe big switch on will take place on Thursday November  at .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"hazelbank residents reminded lock doors following spate walk burglaries","story":"People living in the Hazelbank area of the city have been reminded to lock their doors after a number of walk in burglaries and attempted burglaries in the Inch View area.Sinn Féin representative Hayleigh Fleming said: “This is a very worrying development and it is important to get this warning out to residents in the area about what has been going on.“I have received very worrying reports of a number of walk in burglaries and attempted burglaries in the Inch View area.\"It must be a very frightening experience to find that someone has been your house.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"In most cases the criminals involved are looking for any cash or small electrical good that they can sell on“It’s important that residents are vigilant, look out for their neighbours and report any suspicious characters hanging about to the PSNI or local representatives.\"Don’t make it easy for the criminals.\""},{"url":null,"title":"holland barrett opens new store foyleside shopping centre derry creating three new full time jobs","story":"Holland  Barrett has just opened a brand-new store in Foyleside Shopping Centre, creating three new full-time jobs, with more roles still to be appointed.

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few. Our rural areas in particular must be respected, not used as open air dumping grounds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballycran have it all to do in final  ","story":"BALLYCRANrsquoS hurlers are hoping that history repeats itself at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Sunday when they take on Cushendall in the Ulster Club Hurling Championship final.Itrsquos  years since the McKenna Park side last lted the Four Seasons Cup. That was in Cushendall are the aristocrats of the competition and while Ballycran have lost all three final appearances since their historic win in , the Ruairi Ogs have been crowned undisputed Ulster champions on no less than five occasions.Ballycran booked their place in this yearrsquos showdown after a sizzling display of open hurling, blasted holders and hot favourites Slaughtneil out of the competition.Gary Savagersquos boys were rated as   outsiders against the defending champions, but they left Slaughtneil in tatters with an impressive display.Savage was part of the team that lted the trophy in  and in addition to now managing the side, his two sons, Liam and Phelim, help control matters on the field of play.Both boys are certainly chips off the old block and Phelim, despite still being a minor player this season, is showing his true pedigree by dominating games from the centre half back berth and midfield.He is surrounded by a host of top class hurlers with Michael Hughes Stephen Keith, Scott and Brett Nicholson, Conor Woods, James Coyle and Colm McManus to feed off.Ballycran lost both their Antrim League games against Cushendall by signicant margins, but championship finals are a dferent animal and Gary Savage will have his side in a voracious frame of mind for Sunday. Cushendall are expected to lt the Ulster crown for a record-breaking th time. They have an abundance of experienced players in Carl Carson, Sean Delargy, Neil McManus, Eoghan Campbell, Ryan McCambridge, Donal Naughton and Paddy McGill, but they know they are in for one heck of a scrap on Sunday.If Ballycran can come up with a plan for depriving Carson, McManus, Campbell, Naughton and McGill of the sliothar, then they are in with a shout, but that is easier said than done, given the experience in the Cushendall set-up.One thing that is certain is that Ballycran will give it their all, but some times that is just not enough.Meanwhile, Burrenrsquos bid to recapture their glory days in Ulster is over for another year following their - to - defeat to Scotstown in their provincial SFC quarter-final in Newry on Sunday.Burren trailed - to - at the break, but a stirring second half display saw them give the Monaghan kingpins a run for their money. However, it was Scotstown who had a sting in their tail and they held on for victory.It was a similar story for Bredagh in their Ulster Club IFC quarter-final in Cootehill on Saturday where they were beaten - to - by Cavan champions Mullahoran. Jody Gormleyrsquos charges were desperately unlucky not to progress and were pipped at the post by a goal in the last minute of added time.Elsewhere, Downpatrick beat An Riocht - to - in the ACFL Division  relegation play-off at St Patrickrsquos Park, Newcastle.The Hoops just about held on in dficult playing conditions as An Riocht refused to go go down without a fight.St Johnrsquos got the better of Ballymartin in their ACFL Division  relegation play-off and their - to - win was just reward for a determined display.The only negative thing for St Johnrsquos was the news that manager Benny Corrigan stood down after the game..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch bypass scheme edges closer  ","story":"THE planned Ballynahinch bypass scheme is moving into the contract stage, Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Cathy Mason has confirmed.The partyrsquos Slieve Croob spokesperson has received confirmation from the Department for Infrastructure that work has commenced on drawing up contract documentation for the scheme.She said: ldquoFollowing the decision by the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard to commence work on the Ballynahinch bypass in December , officials from DfI have been working diligently through the ious legal stages to ensure the long awaited bypass scheme can commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed earlier this year.Ms Mason added: ldquoThis has allowed the Department to now move ahead with preparation of the contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity  ","story":"A RECENT fundraising event in aid of Zambian businessman Charles Mwanda has raised pound,.The St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick was the venue in September for a night of musical entertainment organised by Sr Mary Delargy, a missionary sister from the town who has helped dozens of African children out of poverty and into professions over recent years.When Sr Mary worked in Zambia, Charles was her administrative assistant and she says the fundraising concert was not about giving him a hand out, but a hand up to continue with his business and employ a number of local people.The key reason for the September fundraiser was to generate enough money to allow Charles to purchase a generator so he could power his car wash business.Sr Mary worked in Zambia and during this period Charles was her assistant, helping her with the young people she was working with aged between  and .She had helped Charles get his business going through donations but there was a problemwith the power supply which is intermittent. To help keep the business going, he required a generator which is now in place.Sr Mary explained that due to regular power outages, electricity is only available from pm to am, therefore no business can operate during daylight hours.She said the recent concert at the St Patrick Centre raised pound, with an additional pound raised via subsequent donations.ldquoThe generator has been bought and installed and is making real dference to the business, a delighted Sr Mary confirmed this week.ldquoCharles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity of people he will never meet.

Delamont Country Park offers huge potential and re-establishing a network of community trails is an exciting proposal which we hope will come to fruition, he said.ldquoThe response from the public to have its say on the future of the park was brilliant and thanks to everyone who took the time to take part in what was a very worthwhile event.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones. For a brief time, we suggest there is a unique in-between identity for those situated between two countries ndash a Border people ndash and through playful acts we explore this liminal identity.lsquoAcross and In-Betweenrsquo was co-commissioned by - NOW, the UKrsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary, and Belfast International Arts Festival, with the support of the Government of Irelandrsquos Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .Across and In Between was co-created with Cian Smyth, Helen Sharp, Mark Thomas of Soup Co, Pedro Rebelo, Conan McIvor, Helen Sloan, Eva Grosman, Garrett Carr and people in Pettigo, Tullyhommon, Castlesaunderson, Magheraveely, Newtownbutler, Cuilcagh Mountain, Counties Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

the Duke of Kent and Prince Michael of Kent all laid tributes to Britain’s veterans.Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also laid wreaths at the foot of the Whitehall memorial, along with Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow.The traditional two minutes’ silence was held at  o’clock and was

Armistice, we will come together as a nation to stand in silence and honour the fallen of all conflicts.“Over the past four years, we have told the story of the First World War and the unique generation who served so bravely and made the ultimate sacrice for their country.“Today, we will also give thanks for all those that ed and the peace they fought so hard for.”Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “To be at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday is a privilege and provides us with the opportunity for reflection along with millions of people in countries that continue to be strong allies.“The First World War touched communities across the globe and I commend all those who have helped us remember the First World War generation.“We will never forget them or the sacrice of thousands of British and Commonwealth troops who have given their lives in other conflicts.”Among the thousands paying their respects was Lieutenant Commander Sarah Bligh of the Royal Navy.She said it

Located on Pearse Street right beside Trinity College in the heart of Dublin city, it made the perfect location to for the tour, with quirky and fascinating décor and superbly stylish and comfy rooms to retreat to after a day’s exploration.After unpacking, we progressed to the veranda, mixing with guests from all over the island. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly and boded well for dinner in the Courtyard Restaurant, which included ham hock, blackberry sorbet, and a iety of cheeses and enjoyable wines.Of particular note was the delicious freshly baked bread, the creme brulee and the sirloin and the craic was good with a friendly and cosmopolitan mix of guests.After a very comfortable night, the breakfast was also top class, albeit, for once you are recommended not to try everything as one is typically tempted to, leaving room for the gourmet tour ahead.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity,Our guide for the day was likeable foodie historian and former chef Chris Binchy. Starting in the heart of Trinity University campus, he gave a fascinating talk on the evolution of Irish cuisine. Our parents and their parents, he noted, would have enjoyed a pretty nutriotious but plain diet which ied little from week to week. Originally dominated by dairy produce, as Irish society was organised around cattle, the arrival of the French Normans in the th century brought a dferent type of agriculture and cultivation of crops.Dairy products, oats, fruit and root vegetables, cabbage, bacon, eggs and chicken were later added to with scones, tarts and pastries.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity, giving what is today the st century foodie haunts across the city. Consequently, our first stop was a dedicated cheese shop, Sheridans, where we were entertained and informed by a true French man, who took care to extol the virtues of a wide range of new Irish cheeses made in the French style, all of which were passed around with crackers to sample.Next up was Powerscourt Shopping Centre, what was traditionally a wide open quadrangle in the centre of classic four storey Georgian buildings, but has been transformed into a charming indoor shopping complex, the central feature of which is the glass roof.A centre of all things ‘design’, we were treated to scones and cream from the Pepper Pot, which has a pedigree in custom baked breads and bagels, with a cult following among locals. They serve six dferent breads, all baked daily, which form the centre of all their dishes. Who knew Irish cream is dferent to English cream - clotted and not whipped with no sugar it is delicious enough without anything added, we were informed. Disgust after ‘dregs of society’ carry out ‘horric attack’ on married couple in their s Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Next up was the Loose Canon, deliberately named after a colourful cleric. Specialising in natural cheeses, which were delicious, we also sampled a range of delicate parma-style hams, some of which were produced at Ballycastle and have a revered following in Dublin on account of the quality produce. For a change of pace we then popped into a traditional Victorian pub, the Swann, however this was a pub with a dference. It is ‘the’ rugby pub of Dublin, traditionally favoured by touring players the night before games - in the amateur era at least. It was run by legendary Ireland and Lions prop, Sean Lynch. Now run by his son Ronan, Sean still pulls the odd pint behind the bar and the rugby memorabilia on the walls is worth studying.This was followed by a trip to George’s street arcade, filled with ‘boho’ stalls and second hand bookshops, where we stopped at Lolly and Cooks for ‘Savage Rolls’ in Dublin the word ‘savage’ means ‘great’ and boy did these sausage rolls deserve the label. As big as your fist, they were as delicious as the meat loaf my mother used to make. Our last stop was the Temple Bar food market, which is even a hidden gem even to many Dubliners. As you enter, you may hear passionate yells from the acting school a few floors up, while a kaleidoscope of smells invade your senses.First up we tried the fresh oysters and the Temple Oyster Bar - surprisingly delicious. After that we moved onto the Market Kitchen, a food stall with a dference their menu on any morning depends on what all the speciality stalls around them are selling that day. We had sourdough with tahini and pumpkin puree, kale and chilli - out of this world! An interesting and worthwhile tour for visiting friends or family, stag and hen weekends or business trips. * Including overnight accommodation with breakfast and a Fab Food Trail, prices start from £ per room based on two people sharing.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The charity is calling for the loophole to be closed as part of its Roads to Justice campaign, which says an urgent review should be carried out.Currently,a driver can convince a magistrate that they, or an innocent party, will face lsquoexceptional hardshiprsquo as a result of losing their licence they may be permitted to keep it.The latest figures show there are almost , drivers across Great Britain who have retained their licences despite passing the points limit, some with more than  or  points.In the Vale of Glamorgan the highest number of points received by one driver who is still allowed to drive is .John Bache, chairman of the Magistrates Association, said added: ldquoThe process for establishing exceptional hardship is robust ndash magistrates scrutinise every case very carefully.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ldquoThe vast majority of drivers who get  penalty points are automatically disqualied. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mrs Prancersquos husband, Clive, died at  from kidney cancer at the Marie Curie Cardf and Vale Hospice in August , and Mrs Prance said the support she and her husband received was invaluable. She has since raised more than pound, for the charity through tea parties held on her street.Day therapy healthcare assistant Maggie Whitfield also took part in the event, while Jean Round travelled from Swansea to take part having supported the charity for a number of years.Hospice ambassador Mariclare Carey-Jones also took on the challenge for the charity. She is set to take part in her second overseas trek for the charity next year to Vietnam, with husband Dave.Hannah Leckie, community fundraiser for Cardf and the Vale, said: ldquoThank you so much to everyone who conquered the coals to raise vital funds for Marie Curie and those who turned out to support everyone taking part.ldquoEvents like this are essential in helping us continue to raise vital funds to provide care and support for people when they need it most.Cakes were donated for the event by Memory Lane Cakes at the Finsbury Food Group, while Sue from Burger Palace had hot dogs and burgers cooking for participants and their supporters throughout the night.The amount raised from the event is still being counted up.Marie Curie provides round-the-clock care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families at its hospice on Bridgeman Road in the town.The charity also provides a Hospice at Home service and has a team of clinical nurse specialists in the Vale who provide support such as symptom control and pain management.To find out how you can get involved in challenges and fundraising for Marie Curie, visit www.mariecurie.org.uk get-involved. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni. try catch     .               ..

Many staff doing the same jobs are on dferent pay scales and people are confused about who to contact about issues.“I along with Cllr Margaret Tinsley have raised this issue since the council began and to date we still do not have a final council structure.“I understand that every other council in Northern Ireland has long since completed this task and we are still dithering. “Indeed, some councils are reviewing their original structure and doing this for the second time and we haven’t even got it done once.“I again raised these issues at every committee and at full council in May June. It has gotten to the stage that our party is very concerned that the lack of structure is having a detrimental impact on the council’s ability to provide a quality service for our rate payers. “By not having this task completed council’s ability to be proactive and respond \u2028to local needs is being hampered.“The responsibility for the implementation of these structures lies with the most senior officials within the Council and it is about time it was sorted once and for all.“I am calling on the Council to implement a realistic time line for completion of this task to move immediately to ensure every possible effort is made to give our employees and rate payers assurances that this is being taken seriously.“We must ensure our employees know they are valued and appreciated and that any inequalities are immediately corrected.Morale must be boosted and creating the new structure will go some way to helping with that.”A Council spokesperson said: “The Council is going through a period of unprecedented change, the biggest change in Local Government in  years.Raw sewage bubbles up into City Park Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“With three large Councils coming together as one - making the second largest Council in NI - we are working through a number of complex HRissues so that our staff are treated fairly and equitably and structures are fit for purpose, providing the services local people need - whilst providing the best value for ratepayers. “We continue to work in partnership with our Trade Unions and staff to implement a structure that will support our community into the future.

The celebrations were hosted at an event at Purobeach club, which included a fire show and live acts, all with the backdrop of the Mediterranean Sea.“Pinnacle’s th anniversary in business is a very important milestone for us and it had to be marked by thanking the staff who have made the business the success it is today and for the success we will build tomorrow,” James Spencer, managing director of Pinnacle said.“We wanted every inidual in the organisation to feel thanked and special – from our teams fronting calls in reception, right through to sales, marketing, support, consultants as well as the management team.“The company has ambitious growth plans within our Sage and IT services isions, and our staff are key to this success.”And Fran McKee, marketing director of Pinnacle, who organised the event, said:“We have created some very memorable events for our team around key milestones in the business, but venturing to the sun and hosting a white party on the beach was pretty special and unique.“Purobeach and the Tivoli Hotel were chosen for their sophisticated ambiance, location, views and accessibility. The event was hosted in June and there is still a buzz in the business post event”.Pinnacle is a true home-grown success story starting as an IT business in east Belfast, it has grown from humble beginnings to become a £m turnover organisation, with more than  staff working from  UK and Ireland offices, servicing over , customer sites.And  years on, Pinnacle is one of the largest and most successful suppliers of Sage in the UK and Ireland.You can follow Pinnacle’s journey on social with the hashtag #FacesOfPinnacleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Brian-1121.jpg","title":"brian mcgrath we were swept up in a national brexit debate which wasnt relevant for us","story":"Posted on Friday November  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew speaks to Foyle Port chief executive Brian McGrath about sharing UK and Irish waters, the burden of increased bureaucracy but looking at a potential Brexit silver-lining coming down the line There’s a surprising air of optimism surrounding Brian McGrath when it comes to the UK’s exit from the EU.While the Foyle Port chief believes the £m business – which handles around £.bn in commodities each year – could feel the bureaucratic hand of a post-Brexit environment, such as delays, paperwork and a potential “logjam”, that it’s in a unique position, sharing both UK and Irish waters.But he believes the Irish border was a mere “second thought” when Brexit campaigning was at its height – instead, focused around an emotional argument around immigration. A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Riccc.jpg","title":"ni house prices outpace uk market","story":"Posted on Wednesday November  by John Mulgrew RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey Northern Ireland homes have avoided a UK-wide dip in prices, according to a new survey. The latest RICS and Ulster Bank Residential Market Survey shows a larger proportion of surveyors pointing to a rise in the average cost of a home. That was a higher level than anywhere  in the UK, during October. It says that “Northern Ireland surveyors are also the most optimistic, looking forward. A net balance of % expects prices to rise in the three months ahead, while a net balance of % expects the number of sales to increase in the same timeframe. Most other regions expect prices and sales activity to fall or be broadly flat in the final quarter”. In terms of supply, the survey pointed to a slight rise in properties coming onto the market in Northern Ireland for the first time in five months. RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey said: “Interest from first time buyers and a strong rental have been two of the factors driving the Northern Ireland housing market, with first time buyers and investors both very active this year. “Surveyors remain confident about the market, despite political and economic uncertainty, and  is shaping up to have been a more positive picture for the housing market than perhaps was initially anticipated.” Terry Robb, head of personal banking at Ulster Bank, said: “As the survey indicates, demand remains relatively strong and we continue to see a good-pipeline of mortgage applications. “Our new paperless mortgage process has generated interest but more fundamentally, interest in the market remains firm from a broad range of mortgage purchasers including first time buyers, home movers and those remortgaging.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
