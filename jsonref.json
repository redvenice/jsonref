Joggers and dog walkers do not have to compete with cars.Some observers have likened the sight to looking down upon Pripyat, the Ukrainian ghost town left to be reclaimed by forest after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. But unlike Pripyat where buildings were left intact, these Christchurch suburbs have been razed. And unlike Pripyat, the Red Zone presents a rare opportunity for a large portion of a modern city to be returned to nature.   The entire Red Zone, which covers an area of about 600 rugby fields, is the subject of the largest regeneration project in New Zealand\u0027s history but for now looks like it is reverting to swampland.         Crumbling roads are still clearly visible in some suburbs but in others are now permanently a metre under water and can only be traced by rows of listing street lamps and sagging power poles. Pictured is a native pukeko swamphen wading in a street         ‹ Slide me ›    The suburbs in east Christchurch designated part of the \u0027Red Zone\u0027 were once full of residents, but now resemble ghost towns. The Red Zone, which covers 600 hectares, is the subject of the largest regeneration project in New Zealand\u0027s history  Almost a decade after the earthquake once-familiar suburb names have been removed from maps and the only landmark not immediately threatened with disappearing into the landscape is the Avon River. Crumbling roads are still clearly visible in some suburbs but in others are now permanently a metre under water and can only be traced by rows of listing street lamps and sagging power poles. Ducks paddle across flooded asphalt, pukeko swamphens wade through roadside pools and a colony of Canada geese has populated the entire district.It is obvious now that some parts of some suburbs should never have been built upon. Various areas withing the Red Zone have been managed differently since the earthquake depending on how they were categorised. Parts were declared dunes, wet areas, estuarine edges and grasslands.         Uninhabitable areas on Christchurch were \u0027red zoned\u0027 and those inside its boundaries were known as \u0027red zoners\u0027. Among them were originally two groups: leavers and stayers. Many of the stayers were uninsured. About 100 people live here now         Overgrown grass, rusted equipment and graffiti deter children from playing on a once popular playground. For a time the army used abandoned houses for training. It has been proposed empty streets could one day be used to test driverless cars While parts have been left alone to be reclaimed by native vegetation while others have been planted with exotic grasses and are regularly mown. Some properties have sunk so low they are now below sea level and whole suburbs are merging with surrounding wetland. The only way to travel through the Red Zone is on foot or bicycle.For a time the army used abandoned houses for training and it has been proposed empty streets could one day be used to test driverless cars. While most backyards have not been maintained for years some former homeowners still return to examine or tend their old gardens. With the people now long gone and the houses knocked down, the next step is to turn this suburban wasteland back into an area that is attractive and safe to visit once again.          ‹ Slide me ›    Cul de sacs such as Goodman Street at Horseshoe Lake (pictured) were once full of homes where locals planned to live and never leave.

The next step is to turn this suburban wasteland back into an area that is attractive and safe to visit once again  The Red Zone is these days formally known as the Otakaro Avon River Corridor and covers 602 hectares.By comparison, Sydney\u0027s Centennial Park is 189 hectares, London\u0027s Hyde Park 140 hectares and New York\u0027s Central Park 341 hectares. While the area will likely never be inhabited, the New Zealand government has recently announced plans to regenerate the eastern corridor.Those plans include cafes, shops, bike tracks and facilities for kayaking on the wetlands and river. A walking path would meander from the city to the sea.A \u0027Green Spine\u0027 would be at the core of the proposed parkland, 11 kilometres long and extending out up to 150 metres from both sides of the river, with seating, picnic and barbecue areas. According to the government, the proposed project \u0027emphasises the connection between people, communities, the river, the land and new possibilities.\u0027          The start of the \u0027Red Zone\u0027 is evident just outside Dallington, a once popular suburb that was ravaged by the 2011 earthquake Red to Green: The stark evolution of Christchurch\u0027s abandoned acres"},{"url":null,"title":"How BBC bosses viewed Monty Pythons sketches cruel","story":"Share this article Monty Python’s Flying Circus, starring Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and the late Graham Chapman alongside Cleese, first aired on October 5, 1969 on BBC1 and ran for four series.Photos of rarely-seen moments from the making of the show have also been released, including shots from the sketch ‘Sam Peckinpah’s ‘Salad Days’.

I really hated what I saw: I was too fat, too short, my face just looked weird, my hair would never do what I wanted it to, including not prematurely falling out.The other lasting effect was a fear of confrontation.

Pictured: Gold Inlaid Canopic Coffinette of Tutankhamun Dedicated to Imseti and IsisThe show is ided into four sections. Three focus on the complicated funerary process King Tut underwent, from his mummification and preparation for burial, to his journey through the underworld and then his eternal rebirth.The fourth concerns the tomb\u0027s 1922 discovery by Carter, who had spent 16 years on the task, funded by the 5th Earl of Carnarvon.Amid the ancient splendours, the giant statuary and the solid yards of beaten gold, it is the tiny details that compel.Like the shabti dolls, standing silently to attention behind their glass cases, 3,000 years after unknown hands carved them from wood and stone, or created them from Egyptian faience, the oldest known glazed ceramic on the planet. Shabti are small mummy-shaped figurines, slightly bigger than Oscar statuettes, with sweet little bottoms. In ancient Egypt, these funerary figures accompanied the dead to the underworld, but they were not mere toys or comforters. They were placed in tombs to do any work the deceased might request of them in the afterlife.Naturally, the boy king Tutankhamen had hundreds of shabti, many made in his likeness. The one I really love is carved from wood with a head the size of an apple and a little of the dreamy, Thriller-era Michael Jackson about him. Next to him is his Beyoncé-alike wife, in a complicated wig and elaborate eyeliner.I marvel at the delicacy of the carving the ancient chisel marks sculpting a cheekbone or paring the perfect chin and also at their blank, unwavering stares into eternity, for they have survived the civilisation that created them.There are some stunning statues, including a fabulous life-size sentinel with obsidian eyes striding forth into the underworld like a man on a mission.There is also a badly damaged colossal statue of Tutankhamun, one of a pair that stood at the entrance to his mortuary, still a beauty despite the ravages of time.Some of the funds raised on this tour will go towards completing the long-awaited Grand Egyptian Museum, a huge complex of galleries and laboratories being built near the pyramids at Giza, just outside Cairo.The museum has been two decades in the making, has cost untold millions and is about ten years overdue. The latest opening was supposed to be in May, but that has been delayed for another two years, even though Egypt desperately needs this museum.Cairo\u0027s famous Egyptian Museum was never quite up to the task of displaying these treasures. When I last visited, it was like a giant, dusty junk shop, with a surfeit of mummies stacked in corners.When the galleries are finally finished, all 5,000 of the objects found in Tutankhamun\u0027s tomb will be the main tourist attraction, never to leave Egypt again.The opening of Tut\u0027s tomb has never stopped fascinating the world. Yet the expectations around the 1972 exhibition and those of today are entirely different.         At least 60 of them, including two silver trumpets, believed to be the oldest functioning musical instruments in the world, have never left Egypt beforeBack then there was no internet, while TV and newspapers were in black and white and access to information and images was limited. People queued all night to see the solid gold death mask, which is now deemed too fragile to travel and remains in Egypt.It was the very first of the museum blockbuster exhibitions, greeted with a fervour that became known as Tutankhamunophilia. Even the V\u0026ampA\u0027s recent Christian Dior exhibition, the most visited in its history, could boast crowds of only 590,000 — about a third of Tut\u0027s numbers 47 years ago.Back then, Tut\u0027s face duly appeared on posters, postcards, carrier bags and 56 million commemorative stamps.The British Museum sold out of replica jewellery on the first day, and it set a future merchandising precedent for the mugs, keyrings and tea-towels that remain popular to this day.In a lavish gift shop, today\u0027s Treasures Of The Golden Pharaoh sells eye-popping Tut tat, including a giant replica death mask made from gold, brass and copper for — wait for it — 26,000 euros.Will the crowds still be enthralled? It is hard not to be. Here, behind the glass cases beats the will of a civilisation that thrived more than 3,000 years ago. A people who believed that life carried on after death. To facilitate this, in workshops and factories along the Nile, unknown hands smelted bronze, beat copper, carved wood and painted, painted, painted.When his mourners sealed Tutankhamun\u0027s tomb in the Valley of Kings at Luxor, they intended that no living being would ever again gaze on the gold, gems and craftsmanship of a lost civilisation.Yet here they are again.Tutankhamun: Treasures Of The Golden Pharaoh, presented by Viking Cruises, opens at the Saatchi Gallery on November 2.

It was born out of a fascination with the women who choose to eschew conventional modes of living. What exactly does a nun’s life entail, and what happens in their tight-knit community? In 2015, I began what was to become a long-term project exploring the lives of nuns in the Holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary convent in Rome. My interest was focused on stories of people who live “radical” lives, those who decide to exist outside standard modes of living and make choices that influence their entire way of being. I would often walk around Rome, my hometown, and see nuns going about their daily lives. Though they are a common sight in the city, their existence within the walls of the convent had remained relatively obscured from public view. What exactly does a nun’s life entail? And what is life like inside their community? With more than 750 female religious institutes based in the city, Rome was the ideal location to find answers to these questions.The community I visited for more than three years is also known as Sisters Ravasco House in honour of its founder, Eugenia Ravasco, and it is famous for its commitment toward pedagogy. Sister Ravasco convents can be found all over the world, though its main headquarters is in Rome, near the Vatican. The community is composed of approximately 20 women of various nationalities. Some have spent the majority of their lives in the community, as in the case of Sister Odilla, who is in her 80s and started her process to become a nun when she was 13. The community becomes the principal family of these women because once they join they are permitted to visit their relatives only once a year if they are Italian. If a nun is from a foreign country they can visit family once every three years.These women must learn how to adapt and live together. Many have never left their towns before joining the convent, and now they have suddenly found themselves living intimately with people from different countries and of various ages. Those who are physically able are moved to different headquarters around the world approximately every two to three years, sometimes in countries in which they do not speak the language. Elderly nuns are more likely to remain in the same convent and then retire to a specific house in the mountains of Abruzzo, where they will spend the rest of their lives.In 2018 I met Sister Martha, a Colombian nun in her 40s who was staying in Rome while awaiting her new documents to move to Albania, after more than 20 years of living in the Ravasco convent in Colombia. Martha was worried as she could not speak Albanian and she knew she would have to pass through a process of integration.I wanted to understand the different activities the nuns performed beyond prayer and how their typical day was shaped. They would wake up, pray and then begin their inidual routines. Everyone within the community has a specific role. There is a nun responsible for the garden, one who takes care of the expenses and the administrative issues, one who is in charge of the laundry. The nuns would take time each day to ensure they have performed their particular inidual role, while also performing their daily communal activities. On Mondays they go to feed the poor, every Thursday they all meet for a discussion, and so on. From time to time, they also join religious events, both nationally and abroad.In 2016, the nuns attended World Youth Week, a festival for young people organised by the Catholic church that takes place every two to three years. They were excited by the idea of travelling outside Italy and meeting people from all over the world.That year the festival took place in Poland and more than 3 millions pilgrims celebrated the event. The week was filled with a series of religious meetings and group activities that concluded with the Pope’s public appearance in Kraków. For the nuns, this was a rare chance to spend time away from their strict routine. “The best thing was to walk around and meet people from everywhere. Even if we couldn’t speak the same language we were all there for the same purpose and it was good to stay together,” said Sister Francesca.Between the frequent sessions of prayer, the nuns took the opportunity to interact with young people and other nuns from around the world, playing sports and sightseeing.As the years passed and I became more familiar with the intricate details of the nuns lives, I started to see beyond the surface level – a life characterised by prayer and strict routine – and gained a deeper understanding of their journey. Once they have joined the convent, the women cast aside their inidual desires and begin to live a communal, collectivist life based on a shared devotion to God. However, the responsibility and motivation for being there always lies with the inidual.At the end of every year, each nun must present a written report that underlines their desire and motivation to continue living in the community. If the nun understands that she no longer wants to continue on that path she will return to the secular life after a process of consultation with the Mother Superior.During these years, I met only one nun who chose to interrupt her religious path. When I asked her about this choice she said: “I would repeat the experience of being a nun, because I grew spiritually, personally and as a human and I learnt how to see things from a different perspective, I learned how to see the deepest aspects of human life, the ones you don’t normally stop to notice.”The bond created inside the community, that of women helping and supporting each other, seems to be a source of strength to continue this journey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/817e21d244f37411c1c6e03de31e839b33177056/0_1646_1998_1198/master/1998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba470575548dd7decc6e28eeedb03fa1","title":"the art of radiohead sleeve designer stanley donwood in pictures","story":"Bath-based artist Stanley Donwood is well known to Radiohead fans as the man behind the band’s album artwork.

We look forward to working with other museums to strengthen trust with source communities globally, work collaboratively, encourage open conversations about the future of collections and critically, take action.”The Australian government minister Ken Wyatt said the return signified “an important moment of healing for these communities”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa1b4c46758e3738009bdfcf60207d1427961d33/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75ebffdccb7523a13e6b201c8023327","title":"the cockroach ian mcewan review","story":"When he published the second edition of the greatest of political satires, Gulliver’s Travels, Jonathan Swift prefaced it with an outraged letter from Gulliver himself. His chief complaint was that his book had failed to change anything: “instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold, after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath produced one single effect according to mine intentions…” The joke is not just on Gulliver, but on Swift himself and indeed on the art of satire. When did its mockery ever put a full stop to the abuses it attacks?It seems safe to assume that Ian McEwan does not suffer from Gulliver’s delusions. His short, sharp satire on Brexit is not going to stop it, or to change the mind of any reader who supports it. The classical idea that satire can reform the polity has even less purchase now than it had in Swift’s 18th century. Its mechanism was shame: the rulers would see an image of themselves in the distorting mirror of the writer’s fable, feel ashamed of themselves and resolve to be better. But ours is an age of political shamelessness. In the era of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, the rulers create their own grotesque self-parodies and flaunt them before their adoring fans.In that context, McEwan has more limited (and realistic) ambitions. The Cockroach aims not to persuade or in any profound sense to critique. It is written to comfort and entertain those who already believe that the Brexit project is deranged. And even in that McEwan faces a formidable challenge. Brexit has such a camp, knowing, performative quality that it is almost impossible to inflate it any further. How do you make a show of people who are doing such a fabulous job of making a show of themselves? McEwan manages to do so with great style and comic panache.Last year, someone put online a brilliant mock-up of an old orange Penguin paperback cover: Brexit by Franz Kafka. The cockroach of McEwan’s title is of course a version of the giant insect into which Gregor Samsa awakes to find himself transformed in Kafka’s novella The Metamorphosis. His opening line echoes Kafka’s: “That morning, Jim Sams, clever but by no means profound, woke from uneasy dreams to find himself transformed into a gigantic creature.”But in truth the parallel is misleading. It is not just that in McEwan’s case the metamorphosis is reversed: Sams is not a human transmuted into an insect but a cockroach who has taken over the body of the prime minister of the UK. (The room in which he awakes is in 10 Downing Street.) It is also that this fable is much more Swiftian than Kafkaesque. In The Metamorphosis, the story is really about the strangeness of everyday life and the human capacity to deny it. The world of The Cockroach is more like one of Swift’s parallel universes where political and intellectual idiocies are not so much reduced to absurdity as magnified into towering follies.Comparing one’s political opponents to cockroaches is a toxic metaphor with a nasty political history and it is hard to read McEwan’s novella without a degree of discomfort. Jim Sams is essentially a Theresa May (derided by his backbench zealots as “not a true go-it-alone man”) who metamorphoses into a Boris Johnson, a gung-ho go-it-alone man. (McEwan is sufficiently up to date to have him promise to proceed “do or die” and his adviser speculate that he could “prorogue parliament for a few months”.) We soon learn that all of his cabinet bar the patrician foreign secretary are also cockroaches in “superficial human form”. This is dangerous terrain, and McEwan just about gets through it by stepping lightly and moving fast.What keeps him going is his brilliant answer to the question of what could possibly be more absurd than Brexit. He is far too clever to try to compete directly with the real goings-on in Whitehall and Westminster. Instead, the great political project that is roiling Britain is as elaborately bonkers as those that Gulliver encounters on his third voyage: extracting sunlight from cucumbers or softening marble to make pillows. McEwan’s parallel universe version of Brexit is the cracked theory of Reversalism, in which the flow of money is reversed: workers have to pay their employers but in turn are paid for shopping. Trade will function by exporters giving Britain money to take their goods Britain will in turn pay other countries to import its products and services. The only problem being that the only other country that agrees to this reversal is St Kitts and Nevis.McEwan elaborates this great scheme in prose so finely wrought that the plan seems to have some genuine gravity. And this in turn makes it very funny. He cannot hope to laugh the terrible reality of Brexit out of existence, but McEwan’s comic parable at least provides some relief from a political farce that has long gone beyond a joke.This review is from the Observer• The Cockroach by Ian McEwan is published by Vintage (£7.99).

The hard work will be done by our excellent panel of judges and – crucially at this stage – by you.First, a word on our judges. These are three people who have commented diligently throughout the competition and helped make the discussions fascinating and fruitful. They are:Wheeliek AKA Kate WhiteKate is a campaigner who works to promote disability equality in her home town of Leicester and who says: “When people come round to my house they often comment on the amount of books I have.”houseinthevalley AKA Hilary ShepherdHilary lives “in the middle of Wales and makes windows, stairs and kitchens as light relief from writing”. Her third novel was on the Not the Booker longlist last year, which set her off “on the annual challenge of reading and reviewing all six shortlisted books. It’s great to see small independent publishers being given the chance to stand side by side with the likes of Random House and hold their own.”heathercurran AKA Heather CurranHeather lives in Canada and has worked as a police dispatcher and 911 operator for 30 years.

Each judge will have one vote. That’s three potential votes for a lucky book – or maybe they’ll split ranks. Which is where you come in.The other part of our decision-making process is the public vote – the winner of which will take two more votes into the final round, a choice that could make all the difference.The voting process is simple. All you have to do is nominate your favourite book in the comments. Please make it easy for us by starting with “Vote:”, then specifying the title and author. Just one vote, for one book, please – and we’d love to see 50 words or so explaining your choice. As ever, please don’t worry if you’ve changed your mind during the course of the competition. It’s now become traditional that I emphasise the point that democracy is an ongoing process. It’s fine to change your mind. It’s maybe even noble.Here’s the relevant clause from our open and inclusive terms and conditions:11. The winner will be chosen via a public vote from readers who have submitted reviews of their chosen titles, in combination with a panel of readers to be selected by a process outlined in clause 12. Readers may vote for only one title at this stage – changes of mind will be governed by clause four on indecision. A vote in support of one book at shortlist stage does not rule out a subsequent valid vote in support of a different book to win the Competition. Reviews may be written at any time before a vote is cast. Winner votes received after 23.59 BST on Thursday 10 October 2019 will not be counted.This means you have four days to get your vote in.

Official figures from the Office for National Statistics have been less downbeat than surveys from the BRC and the CBI.The BRC said the slowdown in spending was evident both in stores and online. It added that food sales had been holding up better than non-food spending.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said: “With the spectre of no deal weighing increasingly on consumer purchasing decisions, it is no surprise that sales growth has once again fallen into the red. Many consumers held off from non-essential purchases, or shopped around for the bigger discounts, while the new autumn clothing ranges suffered from the warmer September weather.“With four months of negative sales growth since March, the ongoing political gridlock surrounding Brexit is harming both consumers and retailers. Clarity is needed over our future trading relationship with our closest neighbours, and it is vitally important that Britain does not leave the EU without a deal.”Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at KPMG, predicted a period of increased promotional activity to allow retailers to clear surplus stock.

We had a Renault 5 with a slippery back seat and lively suspension, so we would bounce as we crossed a humpback bridge to get to the farm. Through the car window, my brother, sister and I, sticky and argumentative, would often see the backs of two of the Sansom brothers as they picked watercress from emerald-green waterbeds that had been cultivated for more than 200 years. It was farms like Wells that grew some of the millions of bunches that were carted up to London in the 1800s and 1900s. In her essay about the watercress girls, Angela Clutton writes about how it was loved by the wealthy, but needed by workers, who ate it for breakfast in sandwiches, and the poor, who ate it with nothing. She also writes about the young watercress girls and their wicker baskets of green and their early-morning cries of “Wo-orter-crease, wo-orter-crease”.Back home in the 80s, Dad would stuff watercress in his sandwiches, its soft leaves and succulent stems pungent with mustard oils, making it both a salad and a seasoning as good as mustard. It was one of the first things I remember teaching myself to eat, seeing the peppery heat as a challenge that would eventually give pleasure. Mum used to make watercress and potato soup, pan after pan of Jane Grigson’s potage de santé (soup of health) which, despite its colour and name, we absolutely loved with bread and butter.My green-tinted nostalgia and love of watercress makes it one of the edible things I miss most about living in Rome, where it is no longer cultivated, despite being an indigenous plant and favoured by the ancient Romans as a food and a medicine. Despite my living away for years, watercress is still the culinary equivalent of a lost friend, one you instinctively think to call or include, before remembering they are not around, that you will have to put rocket in your sandwich, which is all very nice, but not the same as the chlorophyll whip of watercress. Along with lancashire cheese, bacon, double cream, butter, English apples and biscuits, it is one of the first things I buy when I come back, putting it in or with whatever I can, including these Sunday-night potato cakes.A collision of Delia’s recipe for potato cakes, a Neapolitan gateau (a family-size bake of mashed potato with cheese, more smoked cheeses, egg and salami), and ping-pong ball-size, deep-fried croquettes, these are the recipe equivalent of slippers that have been left to warm in front of the fire. It is also a nicely straightforward recipe.Olive oil aids crispness, butter flavour: which is why I fry in a mixture of the two. You can serve whatever salad you wish with the cakes (or none at all), but if I am in England, watercress is a must. It is all about contrast: the crisp shell and soft-centred potato cakes, matched with the floppy leaves and succulent stems of verdant, peppery wo-orter crease.1.2kg potatoes150g salami, diced or diced pancetta, fried1 large egg, beaten75g parmesan, grated1 tbsp chopped parsleyA grating of nutmegSalt and black pepperFine, dry breadcrumbsOlive oil and butter for shallow fryingWatercressOlive oil and red wine vinegar dressingScrub the potatoes, then boil them whole in plenty of well-salted water, until tender.

It’s an iconic scene with the players and their families, who dress up in traditional Bavarian outfits of lederhosen and toast the moment. The atmosphere is often heady. On one occasion, the story goes, Pep Guardiola spontaneously decided that he and his charges should commandeer a private jet to fly off and watch Juventus take on Roma in a Serie A top-of-the-table clash in Turin.This time, the mood was slightly different. Manuel Neuer “could be happy”, wrote Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Lisa Sonnabend. “He can have a drink on Sunday at the Oktoberfest, because in Wednesday’s friendly against Argentina Marc-André ter Stegen will be in the Germany goal.” The question of who should be between the sticks for the national team might still be a prickly one but normally we might have privately suggested that Neuer could get a start on the festivities on the Saturday, given Hoffenheim were the visitors to Allianz Arena.Alfred Schreuder’s side arrived from Sinsheim having won just one of their opening six fixtures (and Werder Bremen are still trying to figure how they lost that one), having scored a measly four goals. They hardly had a record in Munich to inspire, having not won in their previous 12 visits under, in most cases, more lauded coaches that Schreuder, including Ralf Rangnick and Julian Nagelsmann. Since the Dutchman took over from Nagelsmann, critics have suggested he was really a No 2, floundering and out of his depth.As Hoffenheim arrived to face a Bayern that were still emitting smoke after their flaming of Tottenham, it was hard to see shock potential. The champions were unbeaten this season, unbeaten in 20 league games at home and Niko Kovac made just one change from the Spurs demolition, with Thiago Alcântara coming in for the injured David Alaba.Schreuder had given a bold press conference on Thursday. “To sit back and wait just doesn’t make sense,” he insisted. “We have a plan and we’ll get our chances.” Even if that was the case, the question remained of who would be able to take them. Hoffenheim’s best attacking player, Andrej Kramarić, has been injured and badly missed, while there was no Ishak Belfoldil either.Enter Sargis Adamyan, a German-born Armenian international centre-forward signed on the back of 15 Bundesliga 2 goals for Jahn Regensburg last season and who, at 26, had never played a top-flight game before this term. He had never started one before Saturday. Yet by 5.20pm in Munich he was the unlikely hero of the unlikeliest of wins, as Schreuder looked every bit the seasoned head coach as he maniacally pumped both fists in front of the main stand.Adamyan had an early chance to spring a shock, charging through and leaving Jérôme Boateng in his wake, only to lose his duel with Neuer. It was the first and last time his play hinted at any sort of greenness. Adamyan led the line admirably and after his first strike was cancelled out by the rather more familiar sight of Robert Lewandowski filling the net, he was on the end of an even more improbable twist, again giving Boateng and Niklas Süle the slip on the edge of the Bayern penalty area to guide in a crafted finish.“I still can’t quite believe it,” Adamyan sighed. “This is a huge dream for me. I was still playing in the Regionalliga (fourth tier) two years ago,” he told Sky. “I scored a hat-trick in Hamburg last season. But I think this is a bit bigger.” You can say that again. The last time Bayern lost a Bundesliga game at home had been almost a year to the day, when they were humbled 3-0 by Borussia Mönchengladbach in the midst of the last Oktoberfest.Hoffenheim’s victory may not have been quite as comprehensive, but it was not a smash-and-grab, and it stung Bayern. It was a result that was, in the words of Kovac, “not undeserved”. Despite ending a considerable run of invincibility, it underlined how the perception of Bayern has changed under Kovac. Teams come to Munich not as cannon fodder, but in the hope of pulling off a shock. They dare to dream big.There was very little dreamy about Bayern’s display, as flat as their second half at Spurs had been scintillating. Four days after that result sent frissons across the European football community, they managed only just over half the amount of shots on target (four) as they had scored goals in their notable triumph. “The motivation was there,” insisted Neuer. As always when things don’t go to plan here, not everyone was on the same page. “We didn’t have the right attitude from the start,” said sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic. “The boys know what’s at stake. To go into the international break with a defeat is not ideal.”At these moments, tensions close to the surface drift into sharp focus. Javi Martínez’s evident (and understandable) annoyance at staying out of the starting line-up has become a major topic again, with his prolonged discussion with assistant coach Hansi Flick, in which the Spain midfielder appeared a little anguished, not escaping the attention. From silky smooth to ragged in four days. Neuer was absent from his goal in the closing minutes – not to get a head start to the party, but to advance to try and get on the end of a Bayern corner in a last throw of the dice. Hoffenheim’s – and Schreuder’s – plan had been more failsafe than Kovac’s.• Borussia Mönchengladbach, then, went top, after an early start to Sunday in more than one sense. They kicked off against Augsburg in the 1.30pm slot introduced last season to give relief to Europa League teams, but nobody seemed to let Martin Schmidt’s players know as they fell 3-0 behind in the first 13 minutes. After a stodgy start to the campaign Marco Rose’s attacking elements are clicking into gear well, with Alessane Pléa stepping up this time – he got a goal (gifted to him by an awful Tomas Koubek error) and two assists.• Wolfsburg remain the only unbeaten team after edging past Union, 1-0, to climb into second, with a typival Wout Weghorst finish. Coach Oliver Glasner was less focussed on their ascent, though. “I’m most pleased that we have the best defence,” he said – his team have only conceded four in seven games thus far.• It was déjà vu for Dortmund in the Black Forest, as they again dominated – this time against high-flying Freiburg – only to let the lead slip twice. For a second successive away game a late, late own goal denied them the three points and if Lucien Favre’s side had seen out leads in their three most recent fixtures against Eintracht Frankfurt, Werder Bremen and now Freiburg, they’d be top. “It’s hardly a surprise that we’re going home with one point, which isn’t enough,” lamented Marco Reus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e8ed1082f3e41fe2b53485ce04c3e9ded55fb96/0_73_2356_1413/master/2356.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ae6dc283d79bf3545648ce5fbc6718e","title":"marcus rashford manchester united lack of plan","story":"United’s lack of an overarching plan is now clear for all to see, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær not entirely free from blameWhere does this rank in the litany of dreadful Manchester United performances? Not quite as bad, perhaps, as the equivalent game of the 1989-90 season, the last to start as badly as this, when in their eighth match they went down 5-1 at Manchester City. And not as bad, probably, as the 5-0 humbling at Crystal Palace in December 1972 that brought an end to Frank O’Farrell’s term as manager. But this was bad – bad enough that it is challenging for the post-war podium.Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s mood after the game was reasonable and sad, but also vaguely numb as though he were in shock. There was no obvious anger, no great emotion, just a struggling man clinging desperately to the pat phrases of his profession: belief in the tactics, the need to work harder, perhaps a tweak before the game against Liverpool after the international break. But this needs more than a tweak this needs a revolution, not only of tactics but of morale and self-belief – and probably personnel.United are sleepwalking to something perhaps inconceivably bad. This is ineptitude on an extraordinary scale. Given all the advantages that wealth gives the top clubs in the modern age, given the insulation they enjoy from serious consequences, given United are both the most successful side in league history and the richest club by revenue in the country, it is staggering that at this stage, more than a fifth of the way through the season, they should lie just two points above the relegation zone, appalling they could produce a performance so devoid of quality, of enthusiasm, of a plan.Clearly Solskjær is not the biggest problem at United. Clearly any coach coming in would face enormous difficulties. Clearly this is a club suffering systemic decay. And yet Solskjær is equally clearly now a problem. The week after United won away against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, Louis van Gaal, in his typically pugnacious way, dismissed him as being “another Mourinho” who relied on the counterattack. Time has proved him right: Solskjær is not somebody, it seems, capable of constructing attacks as modern football demands.Now that the initial surge of enthusiasm at José Mourinho’s departure has passed, now that opponents know that they cannot leave space in behind them, now that so many of those flyers have succumbed to muscular injuries as to raise questions about United’s training, Solskjær’s shortcomings are being brutally exposed. His 17 league games since that PSG match have yielded just 17 points Mourinho’s last 17 games before his dismissal brought 26.United mustered three shots on target at St James’, which at least is three more than they managed away to AZ last Thursday. This, it is true, was a Newcastle rejuvenated by Steve Bruce’s acceptance of his players’ limitations and refashioned accordingly into the sort of solid 3-4-3-cum-5-4-1 that served Rafa Benítez so well. But still, it was Newcastle. A Newcastle with two local brothers in the heart of midfield who had started 12 Premier League games between them. A Newcastle that had won just one game this season. A Newcastle with a disillusioned fan base in revolt. A Newcastle that had lost their previous game 5-0. A Newcastle with a manager who had failed to win in 21 previous games against United.This was a Newcastle that, back-to-basics approach notwithstanding, were there for the taking. The discussion around Bruce already had the tone of the end of an era. An early goal might have precipitated a collapse like that in the second half at Leicester last week. And yet United were impotent.Marcus Rashford, perhaps the only player in history on whom the England shirt weighs lighter than his club kit, mustered just 21 touches in the game, four fewer than Marcos Rojo, who only came on in the 59th minute. Juan Mata, the notional midfield creator, had two touches in the final third. The two wide forwards, Daniel James and Andreas Pereira, managed just five crosses between them none found their target. United’s past 23 games in all competitions have brought just 19 goals.The grand new idea of the summer was to focus on youth. Which is fine, laudable even, but youth itself is not a plan. There needs to be a structure, a pathway for them. They need to be joining a club that can encourage and nurture them, rather than throwing them into the storm-tossed water and seeing if by some miracle they can swim. What has happened to Rashford, his reduction over the past two seasons, from bright young thing to frustrated shadow, should be a warning. The casualties of this crisis will not just be Solskjær or Ed Woodward.For United fans there is no obvious way out, merely the sorry consolation that what they are witnessing is not merely awful, but historically so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b30883dc64db4fa2f8a533af3056ee4fb94fdcac/0_121_2925_1755/master/2925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=202e582656fc36fc13b035ce215466ea","title":"premier league 10 talking points manchester city aaron connolly marco silva","story":"City need De Bruyne fit, Connolly is a rising star at Brighton and Everton’s Silva should beware the international breakUnai Emery, in his programme notes for the game against Bournemouth, spoke about the importance of balance and how he wants his side to be “competitive both defensively and offensively”. That is excellent in theory but it needs to be put into practice and yet again on Sunday there was little evidence of that. Arsenal won but they did not play well and the most glaring issue is the lack of an obvious plan. Are Arsenal meant to press aggressively, and if so why did that part of their game drop off so alarmingly? Are they meant to dominate possession, and if so why do their midfielders appear to spend more time running than playing passes? It is confusing and while injuries are an issue for Emery, particularly in regards to his first‑choice full-backs, it is fair to expect that after more than a year in charge his vision for the team would be much clearer. Sachin NakraniToby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, the Tottenham centre‑halves, have looked like creaking 30-somethings of late and Graham Potter set up his Brighton team to exploit their lack of pace. He used a 4-4-2 system, with his defenders squeezed high and the strikers, Aaron Connolly and Neal Maupay, encouraged to play off the shoulders of the Belgian pair. It worked brilliantly, with Brighton finally winning at home and scoring goals. They might have had more, such was their fluency and the ease with which they played through Spurs. It added up to a headache for Mauricio Pochettino – is it time to recall Dávinson Sánchez or even Juan Foyth? – but Potter could revel in a plan that came together. There was a fine performance off the left from Aaron Mooy and a two-goal full Premier League debut from Connolly. The 19-year-old has now been promoted into the senior Republic of Ireland squad. David HytnerMarco Silva claims he received Farhad Moshiri’s full support when they met last week and Everton’s majority shareholder will have had no reason to change tack despite Saturday’s defeat at Burnley. “All the feedback I had, it all goes this way,” said Silva when asked if Moshiri still craved stability with him as manager. “If they saw the game, and for sure they saw it, they can analyse and they saw the same things as me. I don’t believe things have changed.” Silva’s assessment of Everton’s performance, however, was wildly upbeat. Everton, with a starting lineup costing more than £250m, were woeful from start to finish. The clock is ticking on the uninspiring manager of an uninspiring team and given Moshiri’s track record of poor appointments, the director of football, Marcel Brands, should be left with responsibility for finally getting one right. Andy HunterA ticket for Anfield seems to come with guaranteed drama at the moment, yet for all the excitement created by Liverpool’s 95th-minute penalty winner and subsequent shenanigans on the pitch, Jürgen Klopp’s post-match analysis was spot-on. “We were exceptional for an hour, the only problem was that we only scored one goal,” the manager said. The rather prosaic truth is that with better finishing his side would have been out of Leicester’s reach long before the end, with Roberto Firmino, Andy Robertson and Georginio Wijnaldum all failing to put away excellent chances at 1-0. To an extent Liverpool got lucky, though it is also true to say that for all their feistiness Leicester were fortunate to still be in the game. If Klopp’s team are to equal the record of 18 straight wins at Old Trafford in their next game they will hope to be more clinical. Paul WilsonNewcastle benefited from a youngster being forced into the limelight when Matty Longstaff scored the winner, whereas Manchester United are not enjoying such a luxury as their newcomers struggle to cope with the rigours and pressure of being at a supposedly elite club. It is not that the talent is absent, more too much is being demanded of them while those more senior struggle to set the example required. The academy graduates are not just filling in the gaps at United, instead Ole Gunnar Solskjær is having to turn them into the team’s spine and as the weeks go by it isproving a flawed concept and the morale of the teenagers will likely quickly drop. The manager will need his leaders to come to fore, otherwise the worst start for 30 years could result in a season – and managerial era – to forget at Old Trafford. Will UnwinThe fear was that Aston Villa might “do a Fulham” and struggle to integrate personnel brought in during a £100m-plus spend that followed promotion via the play‑offs. Last season Fulham sank without trace but Dean Smith appears to be making a far better fist of evolving his team. This demolition job was achieved via a mix of old and new. Wesley scored twice and had a penalty saved, while Douglas Luiz’s curled fifth came after goals by Jack Grealish and Conor Hourihane. Bjørn Engels impressed in defence while Marvelous Nakamba, the Zimbabwean gaining cult status, dominated midfield. Norwich, by contrast, spent little after promotion and their defensive naivety is being exposed. Nobody has conceded more than their 21 goals and last month’s defeat of Manchester City no longer looks as mighty a feat as it did then. John BrewinMichy Batshuayi had been on the pitch for only five minutes when he ran on to Christian Pulisic’s clever pass and rounded off Chelsea’s 4-1 win over Southampton. It was the Belgian striker’s first Premier League goal for Chelsea since October 2017 and reward for his hard work on the training ground in recent weeks. Earlier this season Frank Lampard was critical of Batshuayi’s fitness and those words seem to have struck a chord with the 26-year-old, who has not given up hope of making it work at Chelsea after loans with Borussia Dortmund, Crystal Palace and Valencia. He will have to wait for his chance, of course, as Tammy Abraham is first choice. Abraham’s goal against Southampton, his ninth of the season, was spectacular. But Batshuayi also has something to offer and his confident finish in the dying stages showed he can be a useful option. Jacob SteinbergSebastian Prödl made his first Premier League start for 17 months in Watford’s draw with Sheffield United and before coming off with a minor hamstring injury, he helped to earn his team a first clean sheet in the league this season. Afterwards the Austria defender revealed that one of the reasons he had not played for so long was a falling-out with Javi Gracia, the Spanish manager sacked by the Premier League’s bottom side a month ago. He declined to elaborate – “let it be history, maybe there will be a book one day” – but said he is enjoying life under the new manager, Quique Sánchez Flores, whose first spell in charge began the month that Prödl joined the club, June 2015. “He is very demanding,” the 32-year-old said of Gracia’s compatriot. “We are training a lot. I like that. There is a good atmosphere and it is much better than it was.” Paul Doyle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b665908e92b8dc5c6189b304e45426ce460acf8/0_0_2980_1986/master/2980.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5ef911f31fa990c54577bb72807c5052 2020w","title":"what are your views on modern masculinity","story":"For our second series about modern masculinity, we’d like to hear men’s views on fatherhood and getting older Earlier in the year we did a call out to  readers asking for your views on the issues affecting men which helped guide a series looking at modern masculinity in 2019.Your responses led us to address questions around role models, intergenerational relationships and even the popularity of Jordan Peterson, and we want to return with a second series, led by you, looking deeper into the areas that you want to see us addressing.We know about some of the issues that men are interested in discussing such as pornography, fatherhood and getting older, so we want to hear your views on those topics but we’d also like you to tell us what we should cover in the next series too.You can share your views in the encrypted form below, anonymously if you prefer.

Shows will be made available by default for up to a year, rather than the previous 30-day limit.Although traditional television channels still account for the vast proportion of British TV viewing, and the broadcaster intends to focus on those channels and on-demand for the foreseeable future, the transition to streaming risks leaving the BBC behind.No date has been set for the relaunch, which will be the service’s fourth major revamp since it launched 12 years ago. It will retain its name but the “look and feel” will be changed, while all BBC channels and live events will be integrated alongside box sets.In a speech on Monday, the BBC director general will describe the changes as “a new front door for British creativity”, as the broadcaster promises talent “unprecedented levels of creative freedom” and a “broader shop window” on BBC platforms. Tony Hall will also publicly accept that the corporation simply cannot compete in financial terms with the resources of its US rivals.Hall previously said that “new entrants” into the streaming market, such as Disney Plus and Apple TV – which are both due to launch before March 2020 – will shake up the existing order. The revamp of the BBC’s streaming service is described as a direct response to the shifting landscape by the broadcaster.Disney Plus will launch in the US in November with Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel franchises on the service, which costs $6.99 (£5.40) a month compared with $13.99 for Netflix. Apple TV will also be available in November for $4.99 per month, as Netflix is put “under siege” by the new ventures.The iPlayer relaunch will be essential as the BBC attempts to compete in an increasingly crowded marketplace, as younger viewers are attracted by rivals such as Netflix. The move also risks angering ITV by undermining the joint BritBox venture, which is due to launch this autumn priced £5.99 a month and is being pitched as a cheaper additional streaming service for consumers who already subscribe to Netflix.Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s director of content, said: “iPlayer will become the heart of everything we do the gateway to all our programmes – a ‘total TV’ experience, which will bring everything you want from BBC television into one place for the first time.”Despite iPlayer pioneering UK streaming when it launched in 2007, its market share has plummeted in the face of new arrivals, while being hamstrung by regulatory constraints – such as only being able to show programmes for 30 days after broadcast. In August, Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, gave the BBC the go-ahead to increase the amount of time that content is available on iPlayer.In a press release the BBC said it was finally removing “the burdens of excessive regulation” in order to “push further and faster than ever before”. But some independent producers have raised concerns.John McVay, the chief executive of Pact, the body that represents the UK’s independent TV production industry, said in August: “The BBC has consistently sought to strong-arm suppliers into giving the BBC these rights for no compensation and without a proper agreement.“Pact has warned its members three times since April that the BBC has not yet reached an agreement with Pact for its ambitious plans.”Previous changes to established BBC streaming products have not gone smoothly. The broadcaster was criticised for “ignoring its audience” over the decision to turn off its iPlayer radio app and replace it with the BBC Sounds app in an attempt to attract younger listeners.The decision was announced last November but as the switch-off began in September this year, users complained that BBC Sounds was only available on new operating systems including Apple’s iOS 11, Android 5 or Amazon OS 5 or newer, meaning those with older operating systems were unable to use it.A spokesperson for the consumer group Voice of the Listener and Viewer urged the BBC to give more time for the transition. James Purnell, the BBC’s radio and education director, said in a blogpost that supporting older operating systems did not offer “good value for money for licence fee payers”.He said: “If people’s devices aren’t capable of running a supported operating system, in most cases they will still be able to access BBC Sounds on that same device via a web browser (eg Safari, Chrome).”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d804f32cc7daed83ba332cae1912732c9ea7d6e6/573_124_4153_2492/master/4153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=224f07f763763ddcdd8a782b6cb683c2","title":"a life in pictures ginger baker","story":"From psychedelic rockers Cream in the 1960s to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, see images from across Ginger Baker’s varied career"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c275ede9dca6e54350239811aa2761c93e1c4023/0_0_6537_3922/master/6537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aee42e8ee5120c99caea0a71d4df2a8","title":"reality tv social media and living your life online with jia tolentino","story":"Jia Tolentino, described as one of the world’s greatest young essayists, discusses how the age of the internet has fundamentally changed who we are.

It was formalised through the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations (VCDR) which was incorporated into domestic law by the 1964 Diplomatic Privileges Act. The reciprocal global agreements also protect UK diplomats working abroad.As well as covering diplomats and their families anywhere in the UK, the same convention and legislation prevents UK officials from entering diplomatic premises. That inviolability enabled Julian Assange to stay in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years. (His stay was not the longest: a Hungarian archbishop spent 15 years sheltering inside the US embassy in Budapest.)Without a foreign state agreeing to lift immunity, diplomats and their dependent families can only be detained “as a last resort” if, for example, they are deemed to be a danger to others or themselves. The only other sanction available to the Foreign Office would be to order their expulsion.According to the Crown Prosecution Service, the immunity does not apply to dependants of consular officials based outside London. However, it is understood that some diplomatic staff and their spouses located outside the capital can get that immunity.When a foreign state agrees to remove that legal protection, it is known as a “waiver of immunity”. Inidual diplomats cannot do so the embassy of the foreign state has to make a formal request.Diplomats are supposed to behave responsibly. The Vienna convention states: “Without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state. They also have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that state.”A US embassy spokesperson has said: “Immunity is rarely waived.” A parliamentary question in 2016 revealed a table of embassies that had incurred the largest debts through ignoring the London congestion charge. US diplomats were the No 1 offenders by a long distance, with 89,308 unpaid fines totalling £10,626,970. Japan came second with 59,533 unpaid fines amounting to a denied liability of £7,072,020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

It takes place on a grid with an infinite number of rows and columns, and it starts with three coins in the top left corner of the grid, as illustrated here.The game has one move. At any moment you can remove any coin, and replace it with two coins, one in the cell immediately below the removed coin, and one in the cell immediately to the right of the removed coin. For example, just say we remove the coin two along on the top row, the grid will now look like this:There’s one more thing. You are only allowed to remove a coin, in the way described above, if the cell below that coin and the cell to the right of that coin are empty. In other words, if a coin has an empty cell below it and an empty cell to its right, then you can remove that coin and replace it with two coins, one immediately below and one immediately to the right of the cell of the removed coin. That’s it. There are no more rules. Let’s redraw the initial grid with a red line separating the four cells in the upper left corner. These four cells are called the ‘bank’.The challenge: design a strategy that gets all the coins out of the bank. If you can’t, prove that it is impossible.Get some coins from your pocket or purse.

Check out Ian Sample’s news story here: (he’s just been on the phone to the newly minted laureate Sir Peter Ratcliffe). And don’t forget to join us tomorrow for the Nobel prize in physics from 10:15am!Prof Bridget Lumb, president of the Physiological Society, has released her thoughts – again stressing how this year’s prize is really a celebration of a fundamental biological mechanism. “This year’s Nobel prize puts physiology front and centre. It shines a light on the vital research carried out by physiologists,” she said.“Cutting edge physiological research such as this is improving our understanding of how our bodies work and thereby helping keep us healthy.“Thanks to this research we know much more about how different levels of oxygen impact on physiological processes in our bodies. This has huge implications for everything from recovery from injury and protection from disease, through to improving exercise performance.”Kaelin’s thoughts on receiving the call have come out – apparently he was speaking to AP.“I was aware as a scientist that if you get a phone call at 5am with too many digits, it’s sometimes very good news, and my heart started racing. It was all a bit surreal,” he said.Hellmut Augustin, director of the European Centre for Angioscience, is very excited about today’s prize, saying it has been awarded for the discovery of a very fundamental mechanism of life.“Hypoxia regulation of gene expression governs all kind of biological processes and diseases ranging from the retinopathy of prematurity in newborns, to the growth of blood vessels in tumours to high altitude training of athletes,” he added.Nobel selfies seem to be a new thing.More reaction – this time from Dr Alex Greenhough at the University of the West of England who works on cancer biology.  “The work by Ratcliffe, Kaelin and Semenza has been crucial to our understanding of how cells sense and respond to changes in oxygen levels,” he said. “Their work is of huge significance to diseases that feature an impaired blood supply, which includes important solid tumours such as breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Their outstanding work on the fundamental mechanisms of oxygen sensing will pave the way for future therapies that will be able to exploit the disease-specific nature of hypoxia for clinical benefit” Just in case you feel that Gregg Semenza has been left out of the proceedings on the blog, here is a picture of him post-win. Ian Sample has a news story up already on this year’s prize – take a look here. We will be adding further details and reaction to the award as it comes in. Reaction to this year’s award is coming in. Dr Andrew Murray from the department of physiology, development and neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, said the award was richly deserved and offered the trio his congratulations. “Oxygen is fundamental to animal life, allowing our mitochondria to extract energy from the food we eat. The work of Kaelin, Ratcliffe and Semenza revealed the elegant mechanisms by which our cells sense oxygen levels and respond to fluctuations, enhancing the delivery of oxygen to the tissues of the body and altering our metabolism,” he said. “Since the first reports of the hypoxia inducible factors appeared in the early 1990s, we have come to realise the vital role they play in our everyday physiology, in allowing humans to live at high altitude and in countless biomedical scenarios. Hypoxia (a low tissue oxygen content) is a feature of many diseases including heart failure, chronic lung disease and many cancers. The work of these three scientists and their teams has paved the way to a greater understanding of these common, life-threatening conditions and new strategies to treat them.”Some have noted that, once again, all the winners are male. Only 12 women have been awarded the prize since the awards began. The last woman to win the award was Tu Youyou in 2015.Sir Peter Ratcliffe appears to be taking the win in his stride.My colleague Ian Sample previously covered the 2016 Lasker prize: here is his piece on Ratcliffe’s work on how cells adapt to changes in oxygen levels. As Ian notes “The discovery has already led to a raft of experimental anaemia drugs that trick the body into thinking it is at high altitude, causing it to churn out more red blood cells.”On winning the Lasker award for his work that has today been celebrated with a Nobel prize, William Kaelin noted the papers behind the discovery were published more than a decade ago. “Most would be considered quaint, preliminary and barely publishable today,” he wrote. “One — showing that a tumour-suppressor protein was required for oxygen signalling — would today be criticized for failing to include a clear mechanism and animal experiments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d3a39b4e05ca6781d6e21088d81baa701afea48/2_0_8885_5333/master/8885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=723700278697a621061fe8454f19872c","title":"id say i had a mastectomy and my mates would go but youre a man","story":"Breast cancer affects far fewer men than women. But that’s no reason to ignore warning signs that include lumps, sores, discharges and bleedingAndy Manson’s wife, Michelle, had to force him to go to the doctor. Manson, a broadband engineer from Reading, had been experiencing a stabbing pain in his left nipple for months. But he ignored it until December 2013, when it got so bad that Michelle insisted. “She said: ‘I don’t know what you’re playing at!’” Manson remembers.The speed with which the GP referred him to the breast clinic at the Royal Berkshire hospital was Manson’s first inkling that something was wrong. “You figure it’s more than just a pain,” Manson, now 48, remembers. He was right. He had stage four breast cancer that had spread to his lymph nodes. Six years on, following a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Manson’s cancer is in remission – and he is hugely thankful he listened to his wife. “I was lucky,” he admits. “I didn’t go to the doctor as quickly as I should have, but I got away with it and – touch wood – I’m in the clear.”Often mistakenly viewed as a women-only disease, breast cancer can, and does, strike men, including Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé’s father, who went public with his diagnosis last week.According to research from Breast Cancer Now, about 370 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK (versus 55,000 women). Most will get the diagnosis between the ages of 60 and 70. Like women, they are more likely to develop it if they are obese.Because men are more reluctant to visit GPs – and because of the misconception that only women can get breast cancer – their breast cancer is typically more advanced by the time it is diagnosed. “When men have a suspicious lump in their chest, they often disregard it,” says Prof Valerie Speirs of the University of Aberdeen, a cancer biologist who specialises in male breast cancer. “This means they usually present at a later stage than women and the cancer can be more difficult for clinicians to treat, because it’s spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.”“Men need to be breast aware,” says Grete Brauten-Smith, a clinical nurse specialist for Breast Cancer Now. She advises men to look out for breast lumps, which can be painless or close to the nipple, inverted nipples, sores on the chest or nipples that won’t heal, swelling under the arm or in the chest area, or nipple discharge, which may also be bloody. “It’s so important that they check their breast tissue, get to know any changes and report them to their GP.”“It was such a shock,” Doug Harper, 57, from Plumstead, says of his breast cancer diagnosis. “I remember telling my mates and them saying: ‘What do you mean? Men can’t get breast cancer.’” Like Manson, Harper was cajoled into visiting the GP in January 2012 by his wife, after mistakenly thinking he had a cyst on his nipple. “She said: ‘Go to the doctor – this is getting annoying.’” When he took off his T-shirt, the doctor’s entire demeanour changed. Jokingly, Harper asked the doctor if it might be cancer. “He said: ‘It could be.’ I said: ‘Oh God.’”Male breast cancer sufferers will find themselves in a system designed for women. When he was recovering from his mastectomy at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich, Harper’s wardmates asked what procedure he was in for. “I’d say I had a mastectomy for breast cancer, and they’d say: ‘That can’t possibly be right.’”He was given the leaflet of a support group, but the wording only referred to female patients. Men attending breast cancer clinics will often be pegged as supportive partners, rather than patients. “You sit in the mammogram waiting room, and you’re the only bloke there,” Manson says. “You feel like people are looking at you, thinking you shouldn’t be there.”At present, men are excluded from breast cancer clinical trials, although the situation is improving. “There’s more research into breast cancer in men than there was before. People are starting to realise that male breast cancer needs to receive the same kind of attention that female breast cancer has for years,” Speirs says. More work still needs to be done. “I’d like there to be more awareness of male breast cancer. Everything is a sea of pink.” (The international symbol for breast cancer is a pink ribbon.)Having breast cancer as a man can be isolating in other ways. The cancer drug Tamoxifen’s side effects can include impotence, which men may find embarrassing or difficult to talk about. After being diagnosed in January 2012, Harper didn’t meet another man with breast cancer until July of that year, when he took part in a charity event.“I made a beeline for him,” he remembers. “I just wanted to talk with someone else who had been through the same as me.” (Breast Cancer Now runs a matching service to connect male breast cancer patients with other men with the condition.)Recently, when he was going for a routine mammogram – his cancer is in remission – Harper saw a young man in his 20s being screened. He wanted to pass on his details, but decided against it in case he alarmed him. “I’ve always wondered how he got on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6215bbcbe1e2ec9b75c2df86b995ed2d790aad99/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e44d3e72d310fce75582fcb335ad784","title":"innout trans woman harassment california","story":"Ahead of a crucial supreme court decision, LeahAnn Mitchell writes about her experience with discrimination“Is there a man in the bathroom?”I was seated on the toilet in the stall of a women’s restroom of an In-N-Out when I heard the manager yell.I had stopped at the burger restaurant in the Bay Area for a late lunch last spring, and was alone in the bathroom when the manager entered. “Sir, sir – you’re not supposed to be in here,” she said.“Ma’am, it’s just me in here,” I responded.I thought she would leave and that would be it. But I’m a black transgender woman, and people don’t just let us live our lives.The manager came up to the stall door, and started looking through the cracks. She appeared to be scanning my body up and down. I got very scared. I clenched my purse to cover myself. I felt she was trying to look at my genitals, attempting to determine my gender. I asked her to leave while she continued to ask whether I was a man.Finally, she left. I washed my hands and walked out of the bathroom to try to speak to her about what had happened. I’m a human that deserves privacy in the bathroom. Why did she think this was OK?“I don’t have time for this,” the manager responded.I felt demoralized, devalued and powerless. I got back to my car and sat in the parking lot. I had planned to work that day for Lyft in San Francisco. Instead, I drove home to Oakland in a fog. I told my partner what happened and broke down crying angrily.The incident affected me in many ways.I’m a musician and was preparing to be a headliner at a Utah pride festival, I had just been featured in Billboard. I was signing a deal to compose for a ballet. I wanted to focus on my career.But what had happened exacerbated my anxiety, stress and paranoia. For a while, I wasn’t leaving the house – fearful of being harassed. I grew increasingly depressed, to the point that I was dropping the ball on my life. I started waiting to get home to use the bathroom, because I felt like it was the safest thing to do. I had regressed and had to rebuild my strength just to walk in and use a bathroom.The smell of In-N-Out still bothers me.I had learned to put my head down and get through things. But I couldn’t just let this go. It felt important for me to stand up and say something.The US supreme court is about to hear a case on whether it should be legal to discriminate against people for being trans. The Trump administration is arguing that employers should be allowed to tell people that they can’t work somewhere because of who they are.The administration is taking a subset of society, and saying it’s OK to treat the people in that subset poorly, to treat them without dignity and respect, that they are less than. Because of Trump, people have been emboldened to think that this kind of stuff is OK, and I’m less safe for it. I don’t know what to do. Being trans and black can feel impossible most days.Discriminating against a person simply because you don’t like who they are should be against the law. No one is asking for special accommodations. I know my rights. California’s laws are very clear: I can use the bathroom that matches my gender identity.So I filed a discrimination complaint against In-N-Out. I wanted changes in policies. I wanted the company to learn and understand. They will have other LGBT customers.In a recent mediation, In-N-Out’s lawyers made it clear that they do not feel the company did anything wrong. It felt as if they told me I was worth nothing. They offered me a settlement that I found offensive. I said no.But I won’t be silent. When it comes to black and brown trans folks, it feels like we don’t matter. Why can’t we exist in peace and have the same rights other people have? Why should somebody else’s opinion of what I should be get to dictate what my existence is? I’m asking that we are able to go about our lives and use the bathroom, without you kicking open the door and dragging us out.There are parts of the LGBT community that have a lot more power and money, and the gay white folks who pushed for marriage equality should be fighting for us, too. We need to be together on this.If they come for us, they’ll come for other folks. This doesn’t stop at us, it starts with us.Asked to comment on LeahAnn Mitchell’s claims, an In-N-Out spokesperson said the company did not harass her or discriminate against her and that the manager was not aware she was transgender. A customer had repeatedly “raised the concern of a man being in the women’s restroom”, the statement said.In an internal company report on the incident, the manager said she entered the bathroom and called out “Sir?” and that when Mitchell answered “Excuse me?”, the manager responded, “I’m sorry – we had a customer let us know there was a gentleman in here so I was just checking.” She said she then exited.“Where we offer male and female restrooms, our expectation is that our customers will use the restroom consistent with their gender identity or gender expression, regardless of their biological sex,” the statement said.The company declined to make the manager available for an interview.LeahAnn Mitchell is a California-based musician who performs as Lafemmebear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ee784fcdd4027a5ef4fd8c71226c1032b8aeb04/0_52_1634_980/master/1634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=956a0dfa172a1c09e7f770c69bb77bda","title":"mindful music how listening to classical can help you be more present","story":"Classical music is known for its calming properties, but it’s more than pleasant background music. Jonathan Lennie chooses seven tracks that promote a feeling of mindfulness in the present momentLife can be chaotic – between work, family and social commitments many of us have difficulty switching off. And the thought of spending quality time on yourself is often forgotten. This is what mindfulness seeks to address. Non-judgmental moment-to-moment awareness is a form of meditation in which we engage with our thoughts and the world around us in the present moment. And being a spiritual art form of fixed duration, classical music is an ideal medium with which to practise it. Here are seven pieces of classical music that can transport us into a world of relaxation and wellbeing.Edward Elgar – Variations on an Original Theme, Op 36 (Enigma): 9 NimrodNimrod is one of a suite of short pieces from Edward Elgar’s Enigma Variations. In popular culture it has become a British anthem, though it was actually a cryptic tribute to his friend Augustus Jaeger. The enigmatic element of the work is useful in mindful listening, in that the overarching musical theme is intended as a mystery that need not be solved – like the mystery of life, to be dipped into as it occurs. Concentrate on what is actually happening in the music as you breathe along with the work’s gentle pulse, rather than zoning out as you anticipate the orchestral climax. The conception of the work is an instance of mindfulness itself. The composer was noodling at the piano when his wife pointed out that he had written a marvellous melody. He had allowed it to emerge, he later said, “from nothing”.You can listen to this piece live at the BBC Concert Orchestra’s Orchestra Unwrapped concert on 26 September.Pauline Oliveros – Deep Listening“Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears,” said American experimental composer Pauline Oliveros. She became obsessed with mindfulness through “deep listening”, a term she coined in 1988 after descending four metres into a disused water tank to make a recording of the same name. The underground room had an acoustic resonance lasting 45 seconds, allowing the musicians to create a smooth overlapping texture by listening carefully to each other. The album Deep Listening presents four pieces conceived as an aid to mindful focus. Choose one of them, concentrate on the constant drone of the didgeridoo, then become aware of the slowly evolving sounds of accordion and voice as they expand and contract around it. Purge your mind of clutter as you focus on this swirling soundscape, allowing the melodic trombone line to order your thinking.Gustav Mahler – Symphony No 2 (Resurrection), UrlichtGustav Mahler declared that: “A symphony must be like the world. It must contain everything.” To experience his immense symphonies is, therefore, to musically engage with the vastness of the human experience, and his second is a case in point. It starts with a funeral march and questions the randomness of life, before concluding that it is wondrous and meaningful. This positivity begins in the fourth movement, Urlicht (Primal Light), a slow, simple song arranged for solo singer and sparse orchestra. When the choir, with full orchestra, enters for the final Resurrection movement and sings: “Die shall I in order to live rise again, yes rise again”, feel the energy flow through your body, swelling and expansive like the music.Johannes Ockeghem – Alma Redemptoris MaterIf ever there was a form of music designed for mindful reflection, it is Renaissance polyphony, which shows the beauty and complexity that can be achieved by voices alone. Alma Redemptoris Mater by Johannes Ockeghem is such an example. Written during the 15th century, this sacred motet is presented by just four voices. Close your eyes, breathe and follow the inidual vocal lines as they flow together and apart, weaving a rich harmonic tapestry of sound. Focus on the beauty of the words: “Loving mother of the redeemer, who opens the gate to heaven, and star of the sea … You who gave birth, in the wonderment of nature, to your own creator ...” After its five minutes duration, you should feel both calm and focused.You can listen to this piece performed live by the BBC Singers on 7 December.Ralph Vaughan Williams – The Lark AscendingThis exquisite musical depiction of a singing lark taking to the air has been described by British violinist Tasmin Little as “floating above a cushion of sound”. Its composer, Ralph Vaughan Williams was inspired by George Meredith’s poem The Lark Ascending. Read the poem, then listen to the music, focusing on the violin depicting the bird as “He rises and begins to round”. Observe the lark’s efforts to take flight: “As up he wings the spiral stair”, swooping as it trills “A song of light”. Follow its ascent, until at last the full orchestra glides with the creature, saluting its “Serenity in ravishment”. Finally, become the lark, letting your spirit fly free – and, in your mind’s eye, look down upon the rural landscape rolling beneath you.You can listen to this piece live at the BBC Symphony Orchestra concert on 1 November.Olivier Messiaen – Quartet for the End of TimeFrench composer Olivier Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time is an exceptional example of mindfulness. Incarcerated in a freezing prisoner of war camp, he created a piece about the end of time itself, when all earthly concerns will be swept away as foretold in the Revelation of St John. This extraordinary piece was premiered at the camp on old battered instruments in January 1941. By writing for the only instruments available (violin, cello, clarinet and piano), Messiaen was adapting to the moment, yet was focused on eternity. The mindful theme is also present in the musical structure itself, which is based on an unravelling mathematical sequence that, if played out, would be infinite.John Cage – 4’33’’Mindfulness is about time, specifically now. Consequently, the ultimate work of mindfulness might be John Cage’s 4’33’’. More of an experimental concept than piece of music, Cage’s 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence presents a set time framework in which a pianist (or any sologroup of musicians) sits at the piano and turns the pages of the empty score in silence. Meanwhile, the audience is invited to listen to the ambient sounds in the auditorium – breathing, air conditioning, the rumble of cars outside ... essentially, listening to the world around them as a unique aural event and appreciating its variety, rather than ignoring it as irrelevant noise. Of course, you don’t have to attend a concert to experience this – just set your timer, close your eyes and listen.Choose your own mindful listening from the BBC’s upcoming series of classical concerts from the BBC Symphony Orchestra, BBC Concert Orchestra and BBC Singers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1e91cc5ea366ece704578ebf57a7724ffb31b97/0_93_1655_993/master/1655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20d09b74cad5000c3399dfdc4cd1de36","title":"chris silverwood confirmed as england new head coach cricket","story":"• 44-year-old hailed as ‘standout candidate’ by ECB• Silverwood’s first assignment is tour of New ZealandChris Silverwood was hailed as the standout candidate with an intimate knowledge of English cricket after being appointed as head coach of the men’s national team.Silverwood, 44, steps up from his current role of fast bowling coach within the set-up to take charge overall, replacing Trevor Bayliss after the Australian’s departure at the end of the 2019 home summer that saw the World Cup secured.“I am thrilled and honoured to be appointed England head coach,” said Silverwood. “I aim to continue the great work that has been done over the past five years and build on our future, especially in the Test arena.“I have enjoyed working with the players over the past two seasons, and developing the best crop of talent in the English game. I am excited to get started and build teams’ that the whole game can be proud of.“There is a tremendous amount of talent coming through, and there is enormous potential for growth. The hard work starts now, and I am confident we can make a positive impact during our winter tours of New Zealand and South Africa.”Silverwood emerged from a process in which the England and Wales Cricket Board spoke to the likes of Gary Kirsten, Ottis Gibson – who has enjoyed two spells as England’s bowling coach – and Alec Stewart, who currently works as Surrey’s director of cricket.Explaining how Silverwood unanimously won the support of an interview panel that also included ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, as well as John Neal, the head of coach development, Giles said: “Chris was the standout candidate. I believe he is what we need to take our international teams forward.“He is somebody we know well, but it is his intimate understanding of our structures and systems and his close relationships with Test captain Joe Root and white-ball captain Eoin Morgan that will help us develop our plans for the next few years. He has performed exceptionally well during his role as an assistant coach and has the ultimate respect of the players’ that have worked with him.”Giles added: “Chris demonstrated in his interview a clear understanding and strategy of how both the red and white ball teams need to evolve. He has some detailed thoughts on what it will take to win the Ashes in Australia and win major ICC white-ball tournaments.”Giles was always keen to appoint an English candidate if possible, with Silverwood, the former Yorkshire seamer, just the second to hold the position in the past 20 years after spells for Peter Moores from 2007 to 2009 and then 2014 to 2015.“Chris cares passionately about how we grow and develop the game through the county network. His relationships with the first-class game, in particular County Coaches and Directors of Cricket, will be invaluable.“Having led Essex to the County Championship title in 2017, his legacy is very much in evidence this campaign, which saw Essex win the domestic double of the Specsavers County Championship and the Vitality Blast. Ultimately, his highest quality is that he is a winner and that will be an important part of the job as we look to strive to become the most respected team in the world across all formats.”Silverwood’s first assignment in full charge is the tour to New Zealand that departs at the end of this month, before further trips to South Africa and Sri Lanka this winter. England’s focus may be returning to Test cricket after the summer’s one-day success but there are also T20 World Cups in 2020 and 2021 that will targeted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51a4b4c480b68e4c4a76b3a8b1dfd554bd8a703d/476_6_2404_1442/master/2404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=989544133eb7f22b8abf5696a79db536","title":"neil black alberto salazar uk athletics mo farah","story":"The UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, is considering his position in the wake of Alberto Salazar’s four-year ban for doping offences.While Black is not implicated in any wrongdoing, his judgment has come under question because of his unstinting support for Salazar – the American who coached Mo Farah for nearly seven years and was a consultant to British Athletics until 2017.That backing continued even when the BBC Panorama programme revealed concerns with Salazar’s Nike Oregon Project training camp in 2015. Previously he hailed the coach as a “genius” – adding that there was “total trust, total belief, total respect” between Salazar and British Athletics.Speaking for the first time since Salazar was banned for four years for “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” following a 140-page report from the American Arbitration Association, Black admitted he was “shocked” at the news – and appeared uncertain about his future.“I’ll be personally reviewing thoughts that I had, the decisions I’ve made, the things that I’ve said,” Black said. “Having done that thoroughly, patiently, sensibly, I’ll come to my own decision and that will run in parallel with discussions with UKA chair Chris Clark and the board. I’m certainly not ready to make any decision.”When Black was asked directly if he would resign, he said: “It’s not something I’ve put in any time to at this stage. When you’re the team leader you have a clear job and it doesn’t matter what comes up you have to stay focused on that. I’ve had brilliant support from British Athletics, the athletes and staff to enable me to focus on this competition.”When it was put to Black that his response did not sound like an outright no, he replied: “I’m not able to answer with any more detail.”In the ruling, Salazar was found to have trafficked testosterone – a banned performance-enhancing substance, administered a prohibited IV infusion, and also tampered or attempted to tamper with Nike Oregon Project athletes’ doping control process. He denies any wrongdoing and is appealing against his ban.Meanwhile Black insists he has total belief in Farah, who was not implicated in the Usada report and has always denied any wrongdoing. “Nothing at all has changed in terms of my belief regarding Mo Farah,” said Black, who confirmed that he would be travelling to the Chicago marathon next weekend to act as Farah’s physiotherapist. “I think it is important to repeat that the British Athletics medical and support teams were always the people who were always on top of, and managing and directing the care of Mo Farah, so we have no concerns.”The US Anti-Doping chief executive, Travis Tygart, has also criticised Salazar for giving prescription medication purely for performance reasons – such as thyroid, painkillers and asthma treatments – which are not illegal under the rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Tygart also said that Salazar treated athletes like “laboratory animals” with the treatments they were being given.Last week one leading British coach with an athlete at the world championships wrote to the UKA hierarchy calling for an investigation into whether such methods were ever employed by staff in charge of the British Athletics team.However, Black insisted that he was “very, very sure” no British athletes had been “involved in any of those processes”. When asked specifically if any British athlete had used thyroid medication without medical need, he said: “Certainly to the best of my knowledge, no British athlete has ever taken thyroid medication when it wasn’t required. It was obviously confidential information but the only time any medication was used and so on was for a medical reason without any question.”Black says he still wants to remain in charge of the British team at the Tokyo Olympics, although whether that will be up to him is an open question after Britain’s lowest tally of medals at a world championships since 2005.However, Black believes there are still plenty of reasons to be optimistic after Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Dina Asher-Smith left Doha with gold medals – and he pointed out there were several near medal misses including Adam Gemili in the 200m and Callum Hawkins in the men’s marathon.“There have been brilliant things, the biggest and strongest one was Kat,” Black said. “After what she has been through, the challenges she has had, the disappointment and the upset, she produced multiple personal bests and gold at world level. For me that was the most satisfying performance.”Black was also full of praise for Asher-Smith, who became the first British athlete to win three medals at a world championships. “Dina at an athletic level, she managed the circumstances and expectation and achieve the things we’ve talked about and it’s huge testament to her as a person and a personality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bf0eff7bc2c7b6c5f8102ebb90a44aa4add475d/0_24_4631_2779/master/4631.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51cf56aa3366f0930c54511b54881040","title":"new york jets washington dolphins bengals worst team in the nfl","story":"Unlike the Dolphins, the Jets and Washington are losing without purpose or any semblance of a plan for the futureA few weeks ago after watching the Dolphins and then the Jets suffer their latest embarrassing, soulless losses, I posed a question on Twitter: Is it better to be a Dolphins or Jets fan? For a fleeting moment all the misery felt equal, after all, losing is losing, right? But after some thought, some enlightened responses and a little more perspective, it turns out Dolphins fans are living the dream compared to Jets fans and a number of other fanbases that again had to suffer through their team’s hell in Week 5. Most of this year’s crop of bad teams – including the Jets, Washington, Bengals, Falcons and to an extent the Cardinals and Steelers – look especially egregious this season. In large part that’s because, unlike the Dolphins, they are losing without purpose or any semblance of remedy.Miami, to their credit have been honest about this lost season. GM Chris Grier already said this year’s Dolphins weren’t “built to win a Super Bowl.” They gutted their franchise, all while getting to examine whether Josh Rosen is a viable option under center. Next April they will undergo a major rebuild with three first-round draft picks, possibly two in the top 10, and a decent amount of cash to spend in free agency. While that’s not ideal for current veterans at the tail end of their careers, the Dolphins are at least dripping in hope. Just look at the Raiders, who were mocked after undergoing a similar strategy last season. Now they’re 3-2 with a young, exciting team only poised to get better.Meanwhile the Jets now sit at 0-4. Sunday’s 31-6 loss to the Eagles was the latest low point under Adam Gase. While Gase cannot be blamed for the absence of their starting quarterback Sam Darnold through illness, he can be blamed for how he has reacted to that loss. On Sunday, the offense was woefully unprepared, including starting quarterback Luke Falk, who Gase oddly decided not to have practice with the first team at all last week. The Jets’ offensive line played as if still on a bye, allowing Falk to get sacked NINE times.“We’ll break the huddle and guys were not getting lined up,” running back Le’Veon Bell told reporters. That’s on Gase.The Bengals, meanwhile, fell to 0-5, losing to the previously winless Cardinals 26-23 in a game that was far more lopsided than the box score suggests. They’ve lost close games like Week 1’s one point loss to the Seahawks and they’ve been blown out. But they lose with a vanilla offense and largely the same cast of characters that Marvin Lewis also lost with before being replaced by Sean McVay’s buddy Zac Taylor. Taylor was flatly outcoached Sunday by the offseason’s most questionable coaching hire, Kliff Kingsbury. It’s strange to group the Falcons with some of these teams given their roster talent, but heck, they’re 1-4 and Dan Quinn is spinning his wheels. Atlanta need a spark and the status quo isn’t it.Then there are the talented players wasting their primes in the directionless pit that is Washington. Head coach (at the time of writing) Jay Gruden has been unable to concoct a viable winning blueprint and, like Gase, seems to be throwing darts when it comes to quarterback. Asked Wednesday about the team’s plans at quarterback for the game against New England, Gruden said, “We don’t have one right now.” At least he’s honest.Each of these franchises has its own recipe for failure but aside from Arizona none have an acceptable “right now” plan. While temporarily painful, Dolphins fans can stand pat with this season’s crew, perhaps dissecting who will be part of the new and improved 2020 Dolphins. You can’t fairly examine Brian Flores’s worth as a coach this season or grade Grier on his hire and draftees until the process plays out. But there is a process.For the Bengals, Washington, Jets and to an extent the Falcons this season already feels numb, like a strange nothingness that just needs to end. It’s torturous to watch Washington and Falcons collect penalties each week like there’s a prize at the end. It’s infuriating to observe certain QB-starved teams not smart enough to consider checking in with Colin Kaepernick to see if he’s in football-ready shape.Maybe AJ Green will get traded for a first-round pick and somehow it will alter the Bengals’ season or a new coach will light a fire under Washington. But for now, far too many are teams are vying for the NFL’s most hopeless award, and it’s torture to watch. I can’t imagine what it’s like for the fans.169 rushing yards for the Oakland Raiders. Oakland’s stunning 24-21 defeat of the Chicago Bears in London came on the legs of Josh Jacobs and an effective rushing attack unlike any the Bears have seen in some time. Sunday’s contest was billed as showcasing the dominant Bears defensive line and why the Raiders royally mucked up when they traded away Khalil Mack last year. Chicago’s run defense had been immense, allowing 61.5 rushing yards per game and only one rushing touchdown. The Raiders changed that narrative with Jacobs fighting for extra yards and finding open lanes on his way to 123 yards and two scores. DeAndre Washington added another score on the ground. The Raiders are now an impressive 3-2. Given the Bears’ recent history and defensive line depth, Sunday will likely be chalked up an anomaly. Still, it was stunning to see any team have an effective rushing attack against this group.Christian McCaffrey and Deshaun Watson. McCaffrey continues to be to rushing what Patrick Mahomes is to quarterbacking: a generational talent who is delightful to watch. In a tight game against the feisty Jacksonville Jaguars, McCaffrey was again the difference maker for Carolina, accounting for 237 yards of offense and three touchdowns (including an 84-yard burner). Since Cam Newton was injured three weeks ago, McCaffrey has racked up 604 yards and five touchdowns. The Panthers are 3-0 in that .Watson absolutely annihilated the Falcons defense in a 53-32 win for the Texans. Watson’s stat line was literally perfect: 426 passing yards, five touchdowns, no picks and a 158.3 passer rating. One of the only troublesome spots for Watson came on in the first-quarter when the scrambling QB fumbled, then picked up the ball and ran for the first down. It was that kind of day for Watson who is quickly becoming one of the NFL’s great quarterbacks. Atlanta have a confoundingly bad secondary and Watson knew how to take advantage of every opportunity, of which there were many.“If the key works Monday, I’ll keep on working” – Washington head coach Jay Gruden.Gruden was the preseason favorite to be the first coach shown the door this season. An 0-5 start later, including Sunday’s lopsided 33-7 loss to the Patriots, and Gruden’s days may be numbered. Washington actually jumped to an early 7-0 lead and stymied the Patriots’ offense for much of the first half. The second half was a different as Washington were plagued by miscues, any lack of offensive wizardry and the Patriots waking up. Gruden sounds like he understands his fate after a dismal 21-26-1 record and wouldn’t mind if his key stopped working sooner rather than later.Unfortunately, this week’s video isn’t a thrilling play. In chilling footage that will not exactly help declining participation rates in youth football, Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph was sandwiched by monster hits from Ravens safety Earl Thomas and corner Brandon Carr. Rudolph crumbled to the ground and lay motionless as teammates frantically waved over medical personnel. It was an emotional few minutes before Rudolph walked off the field. He was immediately ruled out of the game with a concussion. Later on, Broncos cornerback De’Vante Bausby suffered a similar fate and left boarded to a stretcher after colliding with teammate Alexander Johnson in their contest against the Chargers.NFL players are only guaranteed a sliver of their contracts. Dangerous moments like Sunday underscore why we should support players who hold out in a quest to secure every penny possible. This sport was not meant to be played by human beings. Those who risk their present and future every week for our viewing pleasure should be heavily compensated.• Aaron Rodgers has been good this season, rather than the spectacular player we are used to. But the Green Bay Packers are in a good position because this season Rodgers actually has a supporting case to help him out. On Sunday, it was Aaron Jones who stepped up, scoring four rushing touchdowns. The defense also intercepted Dak Prescott three times, as the Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys and moved to 4-1.• The Kansas City Chiefs lost their unbeaten record to the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts seem to be doing pretty well after Andrew Luck’s retirement, and their offensive line and defense were superb all night.• It was a drama-filled week for the Vikings passing unit. Adam Thielen called out Kirk Cousins for not hitting the deep ball in last week’s loss to the Bears. Cousins apologized to Thielen on a podcast a few days later. Meanwhile, a reportedly disenfranchised Stefon Diggs racked up $200,000 in fines for unexcused absences from practices and meetings while teams started inquiring about a trade. Well, Cousins responded with his best performance this season, executing his part in a 28-10 thumping of the New York Giants. Cousins hit Thielen seven times for 130 yards and two scores. Diggs was targeted less often and only caught three passes for 33 yards. Still, he seemed pretty jazzed to participate in one of the NFL’s best touchdown celebrations this year. The Giants have a dismal secondary and Diggs winked when declaring he wanted to stay in Minnesota in the postgame so the positivity could be temporary. But Sunday was a much needed Band-Aid for the Vikings.• Teddy Bridgewater continues to shine in Drew Brees’s absence, this time in a tight isional 31-24 win over Tampa Bay. Bridgewater’s number were astounding, very Brees-like in fact with 314 yards and four touchdowns. The Saints are 3-0 under Bridgewater, all crucial wins over the Seahawks, Cowboys and now Bucs, and all three game were decided by less than a touchdown. The Saints quarterback situation is nothing short of idyllic especially when compared to so many other depleted franchises.• The Ravens were once again saved by the exquisite kicking of Justin Tucker in their 26-23 win over the Steelers. Tucker was four-for-four on field goals, including the game-winning 48-yarder in overtime. He continues to be a rock at a position that has plagued a plethora of franchises. See the Titans, who watched Cairo Santos miss FOUR field goals Sunday.• Hard to nitpick at the Patriots given their 5-0 record and the fact that they won by 26 points. But since we have a few months before they hoist the Lombardi Trophy again, there are a few glaring weaknesses exposed for the first half Sunday, namely the offensive line and lack of a physical tight end. Rob Gronkowski was a generational tight end and any team would be lucky to find a player with half of his impact. Many teams are fine without their tight end being an offensive weapon or even a decoy like Gronk was in recent years. But Brady, in particular, needs more security blanket given his notorious inability to scramble. There was a third and goal Sunday and a lane opened wide enough to entice many quarterbacks to scramble. Brady just threw the ball away after seeing his receivers couldn’t break away on their routes. Of course the Patriots have a top-flight defense and running game and the greatest coach in NFL history so a weakness here and there doesn’t quite have the same impact as in other franchises. But any dent in the armor provides some sense of hope to the other 31 fanbases, even if they know that hope is false."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/701c86297578e08f481a67ad1650bcacbfffdddf/0_52_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=566d9af8312a6c8f2fcfa3ad9f9108ce","title":"european racings showpiece gets its mojo back amid arc day upsets","story":"Longchamp’s raceday experience was vastly improved this time around and thoughts will be looking to the centenaryThe results were not kind to the punters at Longchamp on Sunday, when Enable, in the Arc, and the world’s top-rated sprinter, Baattash, in the Prix de l’Abbaye, were among five beaten favourites on the card. The track itself, however, did its best to make up for it with a much warmer welcome than a crowd of around 40,000 spectators had “enjoyed” last year.Longchamp was woefully under-prepared for the thirsts and appetites of the 15,000 or so travelling fans in particular when it re-opened last year after a €140m (£123m) redevelopment. There were reports of hour-long queues for food and drink and of supplies running out completely long before the main race. On the journey home, racegoers seemed to be spending more time on social media complaining about their miserable experience than spreading the word about a fantastic race between Enable and Sea Of Class.But to be fair to France Galop, which runs French racing, it got the message. A serious investment in (temporary) infrastructure for the one day of the year when Longchamp sees a proper crowd meant that the raceday experience was vastly improved this time around.Rather than spend all of their time queueing, spectators could actually circulate around one of the most elegant and storied racing environments anywhere, and admire, for instance, the clever ways that the ultra-modern new grandstand has incorporated elements of the old Longchamp, including several of the magnificent trees that are dotted around the enclosures. The architect actually designed around quite of few, putting holes in the walkways to accommodate them.As a result, the response to the day was all about the disappointment of Enable’s narrow defeat with no complaints at all – or none that I could see – about the overall experience. Where last year some fans were swearing they would never return, this year it seems more likely that they are already booking up for the first weekend in October next year. After its very unsteady start, European racing’s showpiece got its mojo back on Sunday and France Galop now has a firmer footing on which to build as they prepare for the 100th anniversary of the first running of the Arc next year.It would be wonderful if the race’s centenary renewal could be run in front of the sort of crowd that turned up to see Golden Horn win the last Arc at the old Longchamp. Around 55,000 were there for that one, when a ticket cost €20, but a big hike since has seen the local walk-up attendance in particular drop significantly.It would be fascinating to know how all the numbers stacked up on Sunday, and whether the day was any closer to breaking even (a situation that was discussed in this column a couple of months ago). It made no sense at all to tempt tens of thousands of people into your racecourse and then have them standing in queues all afternoon when they could be spending money instead, so if the add-ons – including betting turnover – are up, there could yet be scope for a cut in the ticket price for next year’s race.Enable will – almost certainly – not be in the line-up, as her retirement is surely imminent. Sottsass, who finished third, could well be in the field, however, as it has been confirmed that the French Derby winner will stay in training at four. With just seven races behind him, including a placed effort in the Arc, he still has much left to do.Pontefract’s meeting is the latest to succumb to the wet weather, which leaves Windsor – where the going is soft – as the only Flat card on turf and Secret Return (4.10) looking like the best option in the most competitive race.Paul George’s mare was all out to hold on by a neck when successful off a mark of 77 at Bath last time out, but she was perhaps in front a little too soon. The time of the race was good, she is up just 2lb in the ratings as a result of the narrow margin and she can make the most of that.Escapability (3.40) and Wild Hero (2.10) should go well on the same card, while Poetic Choice (7.30) has obvious claims at Newcastle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/224babb91280328f20a1cbd18963d1156616ba3e/0_260_4066_2439/master/4066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a239d33b56cb2dbd00a888ad529b163","title":"shuck n jive review soho theatre london","story":"Soho theatre, LondonThis fearless production uses intelligent humour to expose racial typecasting in the entertainment industry How erse is theatre? Are there more roles for BAME actors on stage? What about colour-blind casting? These are questions the entertainment industry has been asking itself in recent times and has answered in often positive ways.But lived experience suggests otherwise for Simone (Olivia Onyehara), who is a mixed-race singer, and Cassi (Tanisha Spring), a black actor. Both are made to feel lucky to be riding the cresting wave of this ersity, though in practice they contend with dire levels of racial typecasting in the audition rooms.This play is about race and representation which, as one of the two characters quips, might as well be called “Dear White Producers” – a variation on the Netflix series, Dear White People. It is in many ways a direct address to industry gatekeepers through the barbed, intelligent humour of Cassiopeia Berkeley-Agyepong and Simone Ibbett-Brown’s script: a erse version of Hamlet the Musical that is “keen to cast actors from a BAME background” and boasts a “gospel slash soul soundtrack” with a street-dance battle between Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.The playfulness grows teeth in the strongest moments and tips into savage, incendiary satire. Nothing is off limits, from the “woke” generation to questions about the worth of making art over taking direct action.Scenes take us from laughter to appalled silence, as in a skit performed in song at a bar, in which the women are crudely exoticised by a white man whose leering becomes a crescendo of racist abuse. In another moment, Simone auditions for a part in Porgy and Bess, but ends up singing about cotton fields, complete with white gloves and jazz hands. This minstrel act is a repeated refrain, the point being that women like Simone and Cassi are cornered into performing the role of the happy slave again and again.The play is being developed in a meta-fictive style on stage as it is performed, and rather than bearing a linear plot-line, it is made up of disparate scenarios, from song and dance routines to auditions, text messages spoken as dialogue and a quiz show that awards points for accepting everyday racist micro-aggressions from friends and strangers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fafda794e7f84de992bc9d36260da92150c4031c/373_518_4075_2445/master/4075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a1e90c78ba947283b9737eb6606ec7e","title":"iphone 11 pro the best small phone available","story":"A cracking camera, great screen and 32-hour battery life – but at an eye-watering priceApple’s iPhone has gone “pro” for its 11th iteration, with dramatically improved cameras and longer battery life, which make the smaller iPhone 11 Pro the king of more manageable phones.Costing from £1,049 the iPhone 11 Pro is one of a rare breed: a premium flagship smartphone that doesn’t have a ginormous screen and is therefore small by today’s standards.Everything is relative, of course. The iPhone 11 Pro’s 5.8in screen is considerably larger than the 4in iPhone SE, but compared with the monsters of the modern smartphone era with their 6.5in-plus screens the iPhone 11 Pro is positively pocketable.The iPhone 11 Pro is essentially the same on the outside as the mould-breaking iPhone X from 2017, with a stainless steel and glass body, Face ID notch and 5.8in screen.The new phone is 0.4mm taller, 0.5mm wider, 0.4mm thicker and 11g heavier than the iPhone XS that came before it, but you’d be very hard pressed to tell, even side-by-side. While the 188g weight is fairly heavy compared with rivals, the rest of the dimensions compare favourably, making the iPhone 11 Pro one of the easiest of devices to pocket, hold and use with one hand.Apple’s Super Retina XDR “Pro level” OLED screen is new for this year and is considerably brighter during regular usage and when displaying Dolby Vision or HDR10 content.It’s a gorgeous display. Sharp, bright, colour-rich and full of contrast. At 60Hz it isn’t quite as smooth a screen as the 90Hz display on the OnePlus 7 Pro, but it wins on all other counts against everything else, particularly at this size.Flip the phone over and you will see a new frosted glass back, which is more grippy when the phone and your hands are cold, but less so than the previous glossy coating when both are warm. The camera lump is now a square raised glass section in the top right with three cameras arranged in a triangle. If you suffer from trypophobia (that’s an aversion to clusters of small holes) the iPhone 11 Pro is definitely not for you.The iPhone 11 Pro has the same A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage as the rest of the iPhone 11 line, and performs similarly. Everything happens promptly, including intensive tasks such as video editing and gaming.The iPhone 11 Pro will handle everything you need now, and will likely be a top performer for years to come. There are two small disappointments, however. Despite being “Pro” the new phone still uses the old Lightning connector for charging, not the much more powerful and adaptable USB-C to which Apple switched all its MacBook laptops and the recent iPad Pro.The starting storage of 64GB is also disappointing. For anyone shooting any amount of 4K video you’ll very quickly fill 64GB, and even if you’re not a “pro” creative, then apps, games and movies will make short work of the space.Apple says that it’s managed to make the iPhone 11 Pro last four hours longer between charges than the iPhone XS, which only just managed 24 hours in my testing – which itself was worse than the iPhone X at 30 hours.I’m pleased to report that the iPhone 11 Pro beats Apple’s estimates and lasts eight hours longer than the iPhone XS, at just shy of 32 hours. It will get me from 7am on day one until almost 4pm on day two. Attaching an Apple Watch Series 5 made negligible difference to the battery life of the iPhone too.That was after the iOS 13.1.2 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.The phone also gets pretty hot when fast charging. It can wirelessly charge too, but can’t charge other devices.The iPhone 11 Pro shipped with iOS 13 but was quickly updated three times to iOS 13.1.2, following the same issues suffered with the iPhone 11.The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which switches the interface a predominately black or dark background with white text. Dark mode theoretically has a battery benefit for the iPhone 11 Pro thanks to the OLED screen, which only consumes electricity for pixels that aren’t black, making white text on a predominantly black background more power efficient than black on white. But you’ll only see a meaningful benefit if the background is truly black and not a dark shade of grey.Other highlights include the ability to swipe-type on the default keyboard, a long-press on control centre buttons now opens up quick connect menus for Bluetooth or wifi, as well as quickly jumping to the settings app. Photos now has an improved view of all your photos. You can silence unknown and spam callers, while location permissions for apps have been improved and there’s menstrual cycle and headphone audio level tracking in the Health app, which also now has a new more useful summary view.Apple leads the industry in software updates, providing at least five years of support from release, where other manufacturers cap out at about three years, and has recently shown a surprising ability to rapidly push out bug-fix updates in quick succession.The iPhone 11 Pro has Apple’s first triple 12-megapixel camera setup. It has the same normal and 2x telephoto configuration as previous models, but adds the new ultrawide camera from the iPhone 11.The combination gives you the ability to shoot at 0.5x, 1x or 2x optical zoom then up to 10x digital zoom.Apple calls this a “pro camera system” and like the dual-camera system fitted to the iPhone 11, it is a noticeable step up from last year, producing some of the best images I’ve had the pleasure to shoot across a range of different lighting conditions.Apple’s new night mode brings the iPhone 11 Pro up to par with the gold-standard of Google’s Pixel 3 in very low-light photography, but note that it only operates on the main camera not the ultrawide or telephoto.The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you’re shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to up to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots - something I couldn’t test in dank, rainy Britain.Smart HDR has been improved in bright lighting conditions too, producing well controlled highlights with detail in both shadow and bright spots. Images are slightly less flat and more dramatic than the XS last year too, which is a good thing.The deep fusion technology, which will be enabled on the iPhone 11 series with iOS 13.2 (tested in beta for this review), also made a huge difference in fine detail particularly in middling light. For the first time with any smartphone, including the Pixel 3, we’re approaching the level of sharpness and clarity at full crop that only a proper camera with a large lens has managed in the past.Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, arguably the best in the business, including 4K at 60 frames per second. With a third-party app you can also shoot from more than one of the cameras at once, which might be useful for filmmakers, but I can’t ever see myself needing to do that.The selfie camera is also improved, bumped to 12-megapixels and capable of capturing an almost terrifying level of detail in good lighting. The front-facing camera can also do slow motion selfies, which kids and big kids will love.Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 Pro is a big step up, levelling to or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features.After a misstep last year, Apple is back on top with what is simply the best smaller phone available. The iPhone 11 Pro has longer battery life, a better screen and excellent performance all round.The camera is also a big improvement in terms of clarity and performance, particularly in fine detail and very low light, with the added night mode now matching rivals. It won’t yet replace a digital SLR for my professional photography, but it’s closer than anything there has been before.The design is still a winner at this size, but is starting to look a little dated three years on from the mould-breaking iPhone X. And there’s no 5G to be seen either, when we’re right on the cusp of it being a key differentiator for 2020.It’s not perfect, but in the sea of ever-larger, hand-stretching phones, it’s refreshing to have a model that’s comparatively easy to pocket, hold and use one-handed that doesn’t compromise on power or features.The biggest issue with the iPhone 11 Pro is its price. The starting cost of £1,049 comes with only 64GB of storage, meaning you will likely have to rely heavily on cloud storage if you shoot a large number of photos, videos or download apps or movies.I won’t pretend the iPhone 11 Pro is even remotely good value, because it’s not. Even if you do get five years of software support. For £1,049 and up you’re buying a product that is unrivalled at this size and paying a hefty premium price for the privilege.Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, super expensive, no headphones adapter in the box, low starting storage This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Each of the companies involved had to pledge $10m (£8m) into a common pot to join.PayPal did not give a reason for leaving the project. It said in a statement: “PayPal has made the decision to forgo further participation in the Libra association at this time and to continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities as we strive to democratise access to financial services for underserved populations.Facebook says Libra is a \u0027global currency and financial infrastructure\u0027 - a digital asset built by Facebook and powered by a new Facebook-created version of blockchain, the encrypted technology used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the £ symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra.Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account.Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the \u0027Libra Association\u0027. It functions as what is known as a \u0027stablecoin\u0027, pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(£8m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn October 2019, PayPal became the first company to drop out, as the project continued to face queries from regulators around the world.When the cryptocurrency launches, users can download Calibra, a digital wallet, that will allow them to send it to anyone with a smartphone. It will be available in Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app.It is not clear which countries the coin will launch in first, though Facebook said \u0027almost anybody\u0027 in the world with a smartphone will be able to download the app.“We remain supportive of Libra’s aspirations and look forward to continued dialogue on ways to work together in the future. Facebook has been a longstanding and valued strategic partner to PayPal and we will continue to partner with and support Facebook in various capacities.”PayPal is not the only company thought to be having second thoughts about involvement. A Wall Street Journal report last week named Mastercard and Visa as companies reconsidering their position before a meeting on 14 October with representatives from the companies involved.Since that report, Visa’s chief executive pointed out that any involvement was only provisional. Al Kelly told investors: “No one has yet officially joined. We’re in discussions and our ultimate decision to join will be determined by a number of factors, including obviously the ability of the association to satisfy all the requisite regulatory requirements.”Libra has been under increasing scrutiny from regulators, particularly in Washington and Brussels, where the project is seen as an attempt to bypass rules on topics ranging from money laundering to tax evasion.The French government has said it would block the development of Libra in the EU, while US regulators have suggested the financial underpinnings of the currency, which will involve pegging the value of one Libra against a basket of currencies held in reserve, could bring the project under the auspices of securities regulators."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06cd580dea24ce9b26eb9b8ca36ddf588b147ca1/155_322_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e2e6db1c3d8578fa5b5eb0ba99489c7","title":"send tip small european ski resort win 200 pund hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about a favourite quieter resort in Europe with a relaxed atmosphere and some local flavourIt could be a bijou ski area tucked away in an obscure valley, an accidental find while heading off cross-country, or a less developed area with an old chairlift away from the main resort starting in a hamlet.

Norton has now said he decided to leave the outlet after it defended the likes of US supreme court then-nominee Brett Kavanaugh and published articles by future prime minister Boris Johnson containing falsehoods.He said: “When I signed up to be their agony aunt, I was aware that it was a rightwing paper and that didn’t bother me, but about a year before I left, it took a turn and there were some things in that paper about which I thought, ‘I cannot be contained within the same pages as this.’“I just had to step away, which saddened me, but I was beginning to feel a bit nauseous. It’s a weird thing: these very nice people would say, ‘Oh, I love your column in the ’ and I’m looking at them thinking, ‘You read the ?!’ That’s not good, that’s not a happy situation to be in.”The presenter of The Graham Norton Show made the comments while undertaking promotional work for the latest series of his Friday night show. He said he didn’t explain to the newspaper at the time his reasons for leaving, but now wanted to clarify the decision.Norton claimed the ’s standards were substantially below those of US newspapers. “Another awful thing is the fact they were such a mouthpiece for Boris Johnson with no fact-checking at all. He wrote an article where one of his solutions to the Irish problem was to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain and you only need to talk to one engineer to find out that’s it’s not possible: the depth of the ocean, the weather conditions you cannot do that. So how is he allowed to publish an article in a newspaper suggesting it was possible?“In America you couldn’t do that. The New York Times or The Washington Post, if they get caught out there’s hell to pay. When I do an interview with an American newspaper, I get all these follow-up calls, asking, ‘Did you say this?’ and ‘Can you just verify the spelling of the surname of the person you mentioned?’ They’re really on it in the way that, no disrespect, we’re not on it here. And when I found out how much they paid him – to do a weekly column he’s paid like a quarter-million a year, so I just thought, no.”Norton said he was restrained in his political opinions because of his BBC job: “Other people who work for the BBC are very political but I don’t feel comfortable doing that. I think when you work for the BBC you’re in a slightly different position. Having said that I do vote and have opinions. I’m not on marches. You wouldn’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out who I vote for, but I don’t say who I vote for.”A spokesperson for the  said: “Graham’s weekly column was widely enjoyed by our readers, and we wish him all the very best with his future plans.”The  has since found a replacement for Norton as its agony aunt: Richard Madeley."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef90673c07680845e5d65a22770fbacd6cc55ce5/0_95_5319_3191/master/5319.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd48ed3e0e34dbd7487a70b5ef4c5386","title":"socialists on course for victory but no majority in portugal election","story":"António Costa bucks the trend of declining fortunes for Europe’s left, but remains short of an outright majority Portuguese prime minister António Costa’s Socialist party has won the country’s general election but has fallen short of an outright majority, according to exit polls.The Socialists’ share of the vote was more than in the previous election in 2015 and followed recent electoral successes for the centre-left in Denmark, Spain, Finland and Sweden, bucking a more general European trend of declining centre-left fortunes.The results mean that the PS, which has governed for the past four years with the support of two smaller hard-left parties, will have 106 seats in the 230-seat parliament, up from 86 and just 10 seats short of an outright majority. Four seats are yet to be attributed according to the results of votes cast abroad.Negotiations to form a government will start on Monday. In 2015, Costa – who had finished second behind the PSD – took less than two months to seal an unexpected alliance with the Left Bloc and the Portuguese Communist party known as the geringonça, or improvised solution.Four years later, however, the hard-left is pushing for major increases in public spending and has accused Costa of veering to the right. The prime minister has already ruled out a formal coalition, but said in a victory speech early on Monday that he will now seek to renew his governing pact with one or both parties.“The Portuguese liked our arrangement,” Costa – whose Socialists, significantly, won more seats than the right-of-centre parties together – told cheering crowds of supporters. “We will see if it’s possible to continue.” The prime minister added that he may also talk to the new People-Animals-Nature party (PAN) party, which won four parliamentary seats and has said it is ready to support Costa if he commits to its environmentalist platform.Costa, 58, has reversed some of the more unpopular austerity measures, including cuts to public sector wages and pensions, introduced by the previous PSD-led government in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis, while still managing to bring the country’s budget deficit down to nearly zero.He has won praise both at home and in Brussels for combining fiscal discipline with successful measures to stimulate the economy, which is now growing faster than the EU average, helped by rising exports and a booming tourism industry that saw more tourists visit Portugal last year than it has inhabitants.The PSD, still associated in the public mind with deep cutbacks and a three-year recession that ended in 2014, was unable to profit enough from a series of recent scandals to hit the Socialists, ranging from a nepotism row to the alleged involvement of a former minister in an army cover-up of the theft of weapons from a military base.“The most probable outcome is a Socialist party minority government with support from radical left parties or, less likely, the small environmentalist party PAN,” said Federico Santi, an analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a90ed2db5c0c9bb449e91f29820b90c879d999fd/913_0_4047_2429/master/4047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3225f08c11180bfdd47010c06c09ed5","title":"idi amins mastery of media revealed in newly published photos","story":"Photos taken by official photographers show how Ugandan dictator exploited media ‘to amplify ego and political will’For decades he has been reviled as a simple-minded and sadistic dictator, or lampooned as a clownish thug.Now tens of thousands of newly discovered images have shown how Idi Amin exploited cutting-edge media technology, populism and radical ideologies to maintain his bloody grip on power in the 1970s.Most of the 70,000 pictures were taken by a team of photographers from the information ministry who followed the Ugandan dictator over the course of his eight-year rule. Many show Amin at public occasions, but some are of private episodes, such as the arrest and humiliation of alleged petty criminals shortly before their execution.Others are more intimate, showing the dictator with his family or close associates, and were taken by officials and associates. Amin is seen with his children surrounded by Christmas decorations, playing the accordion and swimming.Historians say the images, found in a locked filing cabinet at the Ugandan state broadcaster’s offices by archivists four years ago but only now given a public view, provide extraordinary new insights into Amin and the nature of his regime, which was one of the worst in post-colonial Africa. They also cast new light on the reality of life for ordinary Ugandans under the rule of a man held responsible for between 100,000 and 500,000 deaths.Rose Mwanja Nkaale, the commissioner of the government’s museums and monuments department, said she had been surprised to see images of a “jovial character who was very social with the common people”.“It made me wonder what turned him into what he became. He started well but turned into something else. We need to learn about what we must fight against to stop these things ever happening again,” Nkaale said.During Amin’s rule, security services and the military targeted different ethnic communities seen as potentially disloyal, as well as real and imagined opponents. Journalists, judges, businesspeople, artists, officials and clerics were abducted, tortured and killed. Victims included Uganda’s Anglican archbishop and one of Amin’s own wives.Dr Richard Vokes, an anthropologist at the University of Western Australia, who was involved in the discovery, said the photographs depicted a “kind of manic energy” that was both “behind the brutality and part of the brutality”.The display of a selection of the pictures at Uganda’s national museum in a pioneering exhibition has been welcomed by many of Amin’s relatives, as well as the families of some of his victims.Sarah Bananuka, whose father and three brothers were murdered during Amin’s rule, said the exhibition was a good initiative but expressed concern that the official photographs might hide the grim reality of the regime.“In these pictures you see him in parties, enjoying life and meeting people. We didn’t see the other side of Amin, which we felt, lived and experienced,” the 69-year-old said.Hajji Edrisa Mayanja Njuki, the head of the presidential press unit during the 1970s, said the exhibition depicted the “real Amin”. “The pictures that show his good side had never been produced and published. It has always been the negative side of the story,” Njuki said.Unlike in South Africa after the fall of the apartheid regime, or in Rwanda after the genocide of 1994, there has been no official attempt in Uganda to address the violence that followed Amin’s seizure of power in 1971.The exhibition’s organisers had to wrestle with the fact that few of the photographs depict the violence of life in Uganda in the 1970s.“As curators, we have made efforts throughout this exhibition to remind the viewer that for many Ugandans the 1970s were a perilous time,” said Derek Peterson, a historian at the University of Michigan, who is working to preserve endangered government archives in Uganda. “The photos are so overwhelmingly positive in their appraisal of Amin that we’ve really had to work to find ways to bring the violence of the time into focus.”One strategy was to feature images of Amin’s victims, as well as pictures taken immediately after his fall of torture chambers used by his feared security services.So extensive was the violence under Amin that state photographers themselves were at risk. One was executed after taking pictures of the aftermath of a hijacking by Palestinian and German terrorists that led to a raid by Israeli special forces on Entebbe airport in 1976.Peterson said the images underlined the breadth of Amin’s relations with radical leftist organisations and regimes across Africa, the Middle East and beyond. There are photos of representatives from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation meeting the dictator, and pictures of a deputation of black activists from the US.British and other officials expected Amin to choose the west in the cold war battle for influence under way across Africa at the time. Instead, he took Uganda into the “revolutionary international” group of what were then known as “progressive” states, receiving wide-ranging support from Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi and arms from the Soviet Union. East Germany assisted Amin’s security services.Amin was ousted after launching an invasion of Tanzania in 1979 and died in exile in Saudi Arabia in 2003.Bananuka said the exhibition was “a beginning”. “It’s making people come out to think how we can do it better. We need to get more people who are willing to talk about their experiences and share it out. Maybe somebody may learn a lesson or two,” she said.Jaffar Remo Amin, the third son of the dictator, said he hoped it would bring the country together. “The country has never settled and united as one. That fracture will be permanent if we don’t discuss our past and go through healing. The country needs a lot of healing,” the 53-year-old said.Additional reporting by Samuel Okiror in Kampala"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be4140fe2b8a6146b3ae407f987048c267e260de/0_364_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9f13474df28bc6aea0dcccfe947e277","title":"us to let turkish forces move into syria abandoning kurdish allies","story":"White House reveals policy shift, which follows conversation between Trump and ErdoğanThe White House has given the green light to a Turkish offensive into northern Syria, moving US forces out of the area in an abrupt foreign policy change that will in effect abandon Washington’s longtime military partners, the Kurds.Kurdish forces have spearheaded the campaign against Islamic State in the region, but the policy swerve, after a phone conversation between Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Sunday, means Turkey would take custody of captured Isis fighters, the White House said.It has also raised fears of fresh fighting between Turkey and Kurdish forces in Syria’s complex war now the US no longer acts as a buffer between the two sides.The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Monday morning that their US partners had already begun withdrawing troops from areas along Turkey’s border. Footage aired on Kurdish news agency Hawar purportedly showed US armoured vehicles evacuating key positions near the towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad in the border region. Erdogan himself also confirmed the development in remarks to reporters on Monday morning in Ankara.The SDF spokesman, Mustafa Bali, accused the US of leaving the area to “turn into a war zone”, adding that the SDF would “defend north-east Syria at all costs”.The decision represents the latest in a series of erratic moves by Trump, who is fighting impeachment at home, apparently taken without consultation with, or knowledge of, US diplomats dealing with Syria, or the UK and France, the US’s main international partners in the country.Brett McGurk, a former US special envoy for the fight against Isis, said: “The White House statement tonight on Syria after Trump spoke with Erdoğan demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of anything happening on the ground.McGurk pointed out that the US is not holding any Isis detainees. They are being held by the SDF “which Trump just served up to Turkey”.The US and Turkey came to an agreement in August to create a “safe zone” in northern Syria, by which the US-backed Kurdish-led SDF would pull back from the border. The safe zone deal was due to forestall a Turkish military offensive which has been threatened since Trump announced last December the 2,000 US special forces stationed in Syria would leave. Ankara sees the SDF as indistinguishable from Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey and views it as a serious security threat. In the White House statement issued just before 11 pm on Sunday, however, that agreement was not mentioned.“Today, President Donald J Trump spoke with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey by telephone,” it said. “Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria. The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the Isis territorial ‘caliphate’, will no longer be in the immediate area.”The statement suggested that in return for US acquiescence in a Turkish offensive, Erdoğan had assured Trump that Turkey would take over the detention of Isis militants captured by the SDF, on the battlefield.The custody of Europeans and other foreign fighters has long been one of Trump’s preoccupations, and he has lambasted European governments for not taking responsibility for their own nationals in Isis’ ranks.“The US government has pressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured Isis fighters came, to take them back, but they did not want them and refused,” the White House statement continued.“The US will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer. Turkey will now be responsible for all Isis fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial caliphate by the United States.”Syria experts have warned that the US abandonment of the SDF would lead to another, new front in the eight-year Syrian conflict, and could push the Kurds into seeking an arrangement with the Assad regime in Damascus. The Kurdish leadership has long been in talks with Damascus to ensure a level of Kurdish autonomy in north eastern Syria in the event of a US pullout.Two weeks ago, at the UN general assembly, the US special envoy for the global coalition to defeat Isis, James Jeffrey, stressed that the US had an agreement with Turkey on a safe zone, in recognition of Ankara’s security concerns, that obviated the need for an Turkish incursion.Ankara says the planned safe zone could allow up to two million Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey to return, although international observers and the SDF say such a move would amount to demographic engineering. Turkish presidency spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin said on Monday that Turkey has “no interest in occupation or changing demographics”.Another outcome of the Trump-Erdoğan call is that the Turkish leader is expected to visit the White House next month."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoFossil fuel workers are going to be disproportionately affected,\u0026rsquo says Fine Gael TD\u0026lsquoWhen I first moved here I was paying \u0026euro290 for a single bedroom,\u0026rsquo Adonis Moreira saysGroup plans week-long campaign of civil disobedience to put pressure on GovernmentCouple with two children not hopeful of help with \u0026lsquoexorbitant\u0026rsquo creche fees\u0026lsquoBlocking roads also disrupts business as usual, which is what is killing our planet\u0026rsquoAbba singer says teenage climate activist has the patriarchy \u0026lsquopissing in their pants in fear\u0026rsquoSharp increase in employment complaints on grounds of disability, commission says\u0026lsquoIt is not even about a no-deal Brexit, we can not contemplate that.

It is the only check he will undergo before crossing over into Northern Ireland.From the end of this month all that could change with the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st, the date British prime minister Boris Johnson wants Brexit to happen.McGurgan fears the return of the dreaded customs checks of more than a quarter century ago. He remembers the hard border when 300 or 400 trucks could be parked up for hours awaiting customs clearance.“It will be going back to square one, like in the 70s. It would be a disaster. You could be sitting all day in Dundalk waiting to get cleared,” he tells The .It is 11am on a Monday and the Armagh man has been working for six hours and has already lifted and “tipped” a trailer in Dublin and is heading across the Border for another delivery in Newtownards, Co Down.He is hauling a mixed load of food and industrial goods – sauces and engineering bolts – but requires no paperwork as he drives, unhindered, across an open border between two jurisdictions currently within the EU. A return to the border of the past, that McGurgan waited hours to cross. is very real again.Johnson’s government proposed to the EU last week to replace the contentious backstop guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border with a plan to impose a new customs border on the island of Ireland.The deluge of paperwork, the queues of lorries, the hours-long delays, the potential targeting of customs officers by people upset with the return of a visible border “would be a disaster,” says McGurgan.“People don’t realise how bad it is going to be. We, the older generation, we have done it all. We know how bad it is. There will be customs men shot. There will be. Everybody is fighting for a loaf,” he said.McGurgan’s truck was one of 6,639 goods vehicles to cross the Border on the A1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast last Monday. This is the busiest crossing on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Traffic counters operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the agency monitoring the State’s roads, show that on average five goods vehicles crossed this point of the Border every minute on Monday.This is where the impact of the UK leaving without a deal has the potential to cause the most complications.Next to McGurgan’s truck is fellow haulier Brendan McParland, also a veteran Border-crosser. He is heading to Dungannon, Co Tyrone, with a load of peat after dropping plasterboard in Athy, Co Kildare.He usually hauls European steel, landed at Warrenpoint in Co Down, across the Border to Dublin, Kilkenny or Carlow. Normally he can complete two return runs to Dublin in one day from Warrenpoint.“If the Border was to come, you couldn’t guarantee you would even get one load done,” he said, munching on a sandwich in the cab of his lorry.Michael Harbinson is one of several lorry drivers stopped at Applegreen transporting Coca-Cola products from its manufacturing facility in Knockmore Hill outside Belfast to customers in the Republic.He believes an all-island economic unit is the way to avoid a hard Border. Not everyone wants this when it comes to both customs and EU single market rules north and south. The DUP also wants Northern Ireland to be able to vote to opt in to an all-island zone covering EU single market rules for goods every four years.“If the North takes a deal still tied with the South, it is the best of both worlds. It is the DUP who is ruining it. They just stand firm in their stance,” said Harbinson.At the last junction before the southern M1-N1 crosses the Border and turns into the northern A1 there is a fuel service station. It lies between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.Colin Byrne, one of the pump attendants of the junction 20 service station, has no clue how the UK and EU would manage this Border if Britain leaves without a deal.“That’s the six million dollar question. Sure how many back roads are there across the Border. It is not doable, simply not doable,” he said.Johnson has ruled out customs checks at or near the Border but has not specified in his plan where “designated locations” for some required checks might be. Byrne offers a foretaste of how checks might work: “every once in a while,” he says, the Garda and customs check vehicles at the southbound exit 18 off the M1 into Dundalk. “If you saw the mayhem that that causes,” he said.On the bridge over the A1 dual-carriageway next to the Carrickdale Hotel there is a constant drone of noise as an “artic” or smaller “rigid” lorry or a light goods vehicle is always coming or going.This is the north-south White Van Man highway.Between 5am and 7pm last Monday – the busiest period of the day – 5,722 goods vehicles cross the Border. That is one goods vehicle every eight seconds. This traffic is split 50:50 in either direction.“It shows trade is equally balanced going in either direction,” said Séamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, speaking loudly to be heard over the hum of traffic on the bridge.“It is the artery of trade on the island of Ireland. It connects the two largest cities and to have any type of barrier on this, or ersions, or checks, it would inhabit trade and growth economically on either side of the Border here.”Interrupting the flow of traffic here would have a huge impact, he says lorries would “soon stack up” and could be waiting hours if they had to have paperwork inspected or their load physically inspected.The stakes on finding a fix to the Brexit-Border conundrum are high. Leheny explains that five times as much freight crosses the Irish Border than moves between Northern Ireland and Britain, the North’s biggest market, but it is lower in value because it is mostly ingredients and components, and not completed products.“What we make in Northern Ireland, it is comprised of bits and pieces sourced from every corner of the island of Ireland. If we have a hard border, the existence of those products that we make in Northern Ireland are jeopardised because you would have delays, tariffs and the sanitary controls as well,” he said.In the retail game, this Border crossing is an essential supply chain route for multinationals. Northern Ireland supermarkets are stocked from distribution centres in the Republic, and vice versa. Then there are the food products made with ingredients coming from both north and south of the Border.Aodhán Michael Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says that a supermarket chicken salad sandwich can have ingredients involving six border movements (north-south and east-west, between the North and Britain), while “the humble cottage pie” can have eight, including a cheese topping produced and processed on different sides of the Border. Each movement involves tariffs so the overall costs could be huge.“That border crossing isn’t just to move goods A to B. It is a lifeline to the supply chain and to those small and medium-sized enterprises right down to the farmers who are in our supply chain,” he said. “If there isn’t frictionless movement across that border, each of those costs will have to go down the supply chain and it is going to make things tougher for the Northern Ireland consumer.”Connolly sees Johnson’s plan as “unworkable” if it is the final deal because a customs border would amount to a hard border, but it is “progress” to open negotiations because it includes an all-island zone for goods.Driving one of his nine trucks across the Border on the A1, Declan Trainor, a cattle and goods haulier, believes the island of Ireland should be “treated as a whole and as one island”.He has no idea how the Border, just a few hundred metres from his office at Carrickcarnan, will look on November 1st, or how he will be able to continue transporting tiles from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland.“It is the unknown. That is the scary part. The Government hasn’t really said how to prepare for it. They are only guessing themselves now so how are you supposed to prepare?” he said. “You don’t know whether it is a dance you are going to or a war. Sure how do you dress for it?”Speaking a few days later, Trainor says Johnson’s “two borders for four years” proposal has left him even more confused. It has also made people who rely on free trade and free movement of goods across the Border “desperate,” he said.“Whatever concern we had, we are more concerned now,” he said.How busy is the M1A1\u0026nbspcrossing?The Border crossing on the M1 motorwayA1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast is the busiest thoroughfare along the 499-kilometre open frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland.The four-lane crossing between Newry and Dundalk is about five times busier than the next busiest crossing over the Blackwater river between Emyvale, Co Monaghan, and Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, based on traffic figures counted daily by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the State agency that manages the Irish road network.The agency uses a system of counters under the surface of strategically important roads across the country that can differentiate vehicles by wheel axle lengths. This allows the agency to gather data and analyse the volume of traffic and type of vehicles passing on the road for every hour of every day.The counter at Junction 20 on the A1 at Ravensdale between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth, showed that Monday, September 30th – a month before the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU – was a typically busy day for traffic for this major transport route on the island of Ireland.Some 25,301 vehicles crossed the Border over the 24-hour period: 18,175 cars, 6,639 goods vehicles (including the heaviest articulated lorries), 318 buses and 24 motorbikes. That means 17 vehicles crossed the Border on average every minute last Monday. One goods vehicle crossed the Border every 12 seconds.Hauliers, traders and businesses along the Border say any kind of delays stopping traffic on this corridor after Brexit would quickly result in heavy congestion and tailbacks.The busiest times of day are during the morning rush-hour between 8am and 9am, when traffic volumes peaked at 1,935 vehicles, and the late afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm at 1,897 vehicles.The bulk of the traffic crosses the Border between the hours of 7am and 7pm when 19,625 vehicles were counted last Monday, or on average of 1,635 an hour.The traffic is evenly split between northbound and southbound vehicles. However, more than twice as many goods vehicles head southbound between 5am and 9am – making deliveries to the Republic or transporting goods to Dublin Port in time to make the 8am ferry departures to England out of Dublin Port.This route is a critical artery for goods travelling from Northern Ireland south into the Republic. Some 3,425 goods vehicles crossed the Border heading south into the Republic last Monday.This worked out an average of 143 per hour. In other words, one goods vehicle crossed the Border into the Republic on the main Dublin-Belfast road every 25 seconds last Monday.To put this in a national context, this part of the A1 is almost as busy or busier every day than the main Dublin to Galway M4 road at Kinnegad (26,400 vehicles on average a day), the main Dublin to Cork M7 road at Portlaoise (25,700 vehicles) and than the main Dublin to Wexford M11 road at Arklow (22,800 vehicles).Cross-Border workersTen minutes drive south of the Border, dozens of parked cars – nearly all Northern Irish-registered vehicles – line either side of the road off Junction 17 of the M1 near Dundalk in Co Louth.They belong to Northern Irish tradesmen, mostly from across the Border in south Armagh, who park and car-pool into the Republic for work. They are mostly construction works, plumbers and electricians.“There are thousands of people going to and from work every day, crossing the Border every couple of minutes. There are thousands and thousands of guys down south working and Dublin is most of where the work is,” said Neil Byrne, a plumber from Mullaghbane near Forkhill.The Armagh man usually arrives at around 5.50am to park his car and catch his lift to Dublin. He has worked “all over the south” including in Kildare and Athlone.Byrne says he and his fellow commuters to the Republic are concerned about a crash-out Brexit and the return of a hard border resulting in hours and hours of traffic delays crossing the Border.He doesn’t believe a hard border would work it does not make sense to have one, he says. “It is one small country in my opinion: it doesn’t matter whether you are north or south, Ireland is Ireland and you have to get to your work regardless,” he said.Delays and traffic jams are not his only worry.“If there’s a Border, it has the whole issue of the Troubles starting again because in my own personal opinion it is going to happen the exact same way it did back then: customs guys get attacked, then there is a police presence, then they get attacked and then there is a military presence,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to set it off.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: ShandonHotelSpa“This winter will be the death of some of us. Many will close”.That is the message to Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, from Carolynne Harrison, general manager of the Shandon Hotel and Spa, in Dunfanaghy, Co Donegal.“It is not even about a no deal Brexit, we can not contemplate that. It is too awful,” she says.What is of immediate concern to Ms Harrison is the decline in tourist numbers from Britain, which had been showing tentative signs of recovery, before a drop in August. The weakness of the British pound is another problem and Ms Harrison says the industry in the northwest needs the Government to stimulate business with a return to a special, reduced, VAT\u0026nbsprate.The Shandon Hotel was itself a casualty of the recession and was brought out of receivership by new owners in 2016.“It had been a seasonal hotel but people have worked very hard and we are now keeping a staff of 130 on all year round,” Ms Harrison said.The business, a member of the Irish Hotels Federation, ersified into attracting tourists from Europe and the United States. But Ms Harrison says many hospitality businesses in the northwest depend on weddings and “nobody is booking weddings because they don’t know if there will be a Border”.She said the Government needs to do something with the VAT\u0026nbspnow rather than wait for a no-deal Brexit.A two-tier industryJohn O’Neill of The Hampton Court Hotel near Enfield in Co Meath also said the VAT\u0026nbspissue needs to be reviewed. Market conditions are different in “the Galways, Dublin and Killarneys of this world,” he said. For the Hamlet Court Hotel tour business is already 20 per cent down, and he agreed the main issue is not a potential no-deal Brexit, but an already significant decline in the hotel’s tours from Britain.Michael Lennon, president of the Irish Hotels Federation said 62 per cent of federation members had seen a drop in business levels from Northern Ireland while almost three-quarters of hoteliers (73 per cent) report a fall-off from the UK. He said there was a two-tier industry, which the Government was failing to address.Adrian Cummins of the Restaurants Association of Ireland was more militant in his response saying the message for the Government would be “no VAT, no vote”.He said the level of VAT\u0026nbspat about 9 per cent was in line with international experience and warned against Mr Donohoe and his officials “judging the industry by their ability to get a table in a restaurant in Dublin on a Saturday night”.Tourism Ireland said last year’s ending of the special VAT\u0026nbsprate was definitely being felt by hotels across the State, as part of a squeeze which included slower rates of growth and increasing costs such as insurance.However, in a Dáil response to questions from Fine Gael TD for Sligo-Leitrim, Tony McLoughlin, Mr Donohoe said there did not appear to be a case for a review of the Vat rate. He said “given the impact of an increase in the VAT rate on the hospitality sector has only recently been reviewed by my department and the Revenue Commissioners, there does not seem to currently be a case for reviewing the impact of the increase.He added “any reduction in VAT\u0026nbsprates incurs a cost to the exchequer, which would necessitate recovery elsewhere”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4042051.1570398772!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"budget 2020 changes to scheme for first time buyers planned","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Taoiseach had signalled changes to the help-to-buy scheme, saying some couples who could already afford a deposit were benefitting. File photograph: Getty The Government’s help-to-buy scheme will be modified so that “couples who can already well afford to buy” will not be unfairly subsidised, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.It is expected that an altered version of the incentive will form part of Tuesday’s budget following talks between Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Independent Alliance.All parties have agreed that the scheme, which offers tax rebates of up to €20,000 to first-time buyers purchasing a new build worth up to €500,000, should continue. It had been due to end in December.The Government has been examining lowering the cap from €500,000 to somewhere between €250,000 to €300,000. A senior source said there are still “mixed views” on the proposals but it is hoped that lowering the cap will incentivise developers to build more affordable homes in this price range.Mr Varadkar has signalled changes to the scheme, saying some couples who could already afford a deposit were benefitting.“What we’re working on are some modifications to make sure that it is actually helping young couples to buy, rather than subsidising couples who can already well afford to buy.”Some €206.4 million had been claimed by such first-time buyers by August of this year. Talks have centred on the proposed new cap as well as the funding of the scheme as it must be paid from the Government’s limited €700 million spending pot.Last-minute meetings between the Taoiseach, Ministers and the Independent Alliance continued on Sunday with the focus on carbon tax and health. In health, it is anticipated there will be extra funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund as well more money for home-help hours. Free GP care for under-eights is expected to be introduced at the start of the school year while prescription charges for over 70s are to be reduced. In social protection, there are expected to be no blanket welfare increases, as in previous budgets.The extra financial allocation to the Department of Social Protection is likely to be half of the €360 million secured last year, say sources. Minimum wageThe living-alone payment and qualified-child payment are likely to be increased as part of a series of targeted measures.On tax, there are expected to be no across-the-board cuts. Instead, small tweaks to the universal social charge are expected in order to protect against the expected rise in the minimum wage.However, it has emerged that any increase in the minimum wage could be deferred for a couple of months until March of next year in the event of a no-deal Brexit.While there is no financial room for across-the-board tax cuts, the Government is seeking to “correct anomalies” in the system.The personal tax credit for a self-employed person is €300 lower than the tax credit for PAYE workers.Meanwhile, the carbon tax is likely to be increased to between €6 and €7 a tonne. Talks were under way between the Independent Alliance and Mr Donohoe on Sunday night with members of the alliance keen to ensure there are financial supports available to poorer households who cannot afford an increase in the carbon tax.Speaking at a Fine Gael presidential dinner over the weekend, Mr Varadkar said there would also be provisions in the budget for increased demand for health, education and disability services. “It will also be a climate budget. We will use the budget to step-up climate action. We must do that in every budget from now on.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Boost for Boris Johnson as Court of Session refuses to set out sanction if he defies Benn ActExpansion of Delhi underground halted over pollution fearsExtinction Rebellion: 135 protesters arrested as London blockades begin - live updatesTrump abandons Kurds who fought Isil as he allows Turkish assault on northern SyriaHarry Dunn death: Boris Johnson will \u0026#39personally\u0026#39 ask Trump to send back diplomat\u0026#39s wife over fatal crashWhat do Extinction Rebellion want from their protests - and where in London will they be held?Comment: Jennifer Arcuri just gave a live TV interview about Boris Johnson... and it was utterly spectacularIraqi army admits using \u0026#39excessive force\u0026#39 as protest death toll tops 100At least nine migrants dead after boat capsizes off Italian island of LampedusaWho will win Strictly Come Dancing 2019?

According to less timely official data, online sales have been growing strongly compared with 2018 until at least August, the last month covered by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).“Ongoing Brexit uncertainty is clearly having a material impact on the consumer psyche,” said\u0026nbspPaul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG.Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, agreed, noting that many consumers held off from non-essential purchases or shopped\u0026nbsparound for bigger discounts.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesDemand for new ranges of autumn clothing was also dented by warm weather in September, Ms Dickinson said.“With four months of negative sales growth since March, the ongoing political gridlock surrounding Brexit is harming both consumers and retailers,” she added.“Clarity is needed over our future trading relationship with our closest neighbours, and it is vitally important that Britain does not leave the EU without a deal.”Retail sales and broader consumer spending have been a bright spot in an otherwise fragile UK economy this year. However, according to official data, year-on-year growth in retail sales has slowed sharply from a peak in March to stand at 2.7 per cent in August.On the less volatile three-month measure, retail sales inched up only 0.6 per cent in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, the ONS said. That was only a slight improvement on July’s 0.5 per cent rise, which was the weakest increase since December.The BRC-KPMG Retail Sales Monitor covered five weeks between 25 August and 28 September.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs.

The flare event ... was so powerful it had consequences on the surrounding of our galaxy. We are the witness to the awakening of the sleeping beauty.”Sagittarius A\u0026nbsptends to be a relatively stable “sleeping dragon”, researchers said.But the study suggests the\u0026nbspblack hole woke up dramatically as our ancient ancestors,\u0026nbspthe ape-like Australopithecines, were already afoot in Africa, releasing a burst known as a Seyfert flare.Study leader Professor Joss Bland-Hawthorn, of the University of Sydney, said: “The flare must have been a bit like a lighthouse beam.Nasa scientists get unprecedented view as black hole rips apart a starBlack hole behaving in a way scientists have never seen before“Imagine darkness, and then someone switches on a lighthouse beacon for a brief period of time.”His team at Australia’s ARC Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions (ASTRO 3D) described it as a “titanic, expanding beam of energy”.Professor Lisa Kewley, director of ASTRO 3D, said: “This is a dramatic event that happened a few million years ago in the Milky Way’s history.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is lucky we’re not residing there.”In 1996, astronomers became aware of a strange glow radiating from the\u0026nbspMagellanic\u0026nbspStream. Scientists began to hunt for a cause and Sagittarius A\u0026nbspbecame the prime suspect.The team first described the evidence of this explosion in 2013, when they identified the black hole\u0026nbspas the cause.Their latest work, published in the Astrophysical Journal, builds upon and reinforces their previous findings.Based on a recent analysis of the data gathered by the Hubble Space Telescope, the researchers calculated the massive explosion took place 3.5 million years ago and lasted around 300,000 years.Black hole named \u0027embellished dark source of unending creation\u0027Galaxy next to us is ‘violent’ and coming to eat the Milky WayThe question of how black holes evolve, influence and interact with galaxies “is an outstanding problem in astrophysics”, the researchers added.Black holes are places where matter is compressed by gravity to a point where the normal laws of physics break down, bending and distorting space and time.By definition, they cannot be seen in the conventional sense, making them hard to study. Their presence is inferred from radiation emitted as gas and debris swirl around them.In another contrast to its sleepy persona, last month\u0026nbspresearchers discovered Sagittarius A was “growing hungrier”,\u0026nbspeating far more interstellar gas and dust than it had\u0026nbspever been seen doing before.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

According to less timely official data, online sales have been growing strongly compared with 2018 until at least August, the last month covered by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).“Ongoing Brexit uncertainty is clearly having a material impact on the consumer psyche,” said\u0026nbspPaul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG.Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, agreed, noting that many consumers held off from non-essential purchases or shopped\u0026nbsparound for bigger discounts. Out of 13 product categories in the BRC figures, only sales of food and household appliances showed growth on either measure.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesDemand for new ranges of autumn clothing was also dented by warm weather in September, Ms Dickinson said.“With four months of negative sales growth since March, the ongoing political gridlock surrounding Brexit is harming both consumers and retailers,” she added.“Clarity is needed over our future trading relationship with our closest neighbours, and it is vitally important that Britain does not leave the EU without a deal.”Retail sales and broader consumer spending have been a bright spot in an otherwise fragile UK economy this year. However, according to official data, year-on-year growth in retail sales has slowed sharply from a peak in March to stand at 2.7 per cent in August.On the less volatile three-month measure, retail sales inched up only 0.6 per cent in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, the ONS said. That was only a slight improvement on July’s 0.5 per cent rise, which was the weakest increase since December.The BRC-KPMG Retail Sales Monitor covered five weeks between 25 August and 28 September.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Why  Because, for the EU, the aim was never to avoid a hard border in Ireland — something these proposals plainly achieve.The aim, rather, was to keep Britain in a subordinate position, still subject to EU law and trade policy.Brussels was reluctant to spell this out in so many words — at least publicly.A fly-on-the-wall documentary caught the staff of the European Parliament’s Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, cheering when Theresa May’s Cabinet accepted the backstop.“It took us two years,” said one, joyfully, “but we finally turned them into a colony”. Obviously, though, EU officials couldn’t take this line openly.So, instead of owning up that their goal was to keep Britain tied to their laws, they invented a story about avoiding border checks and making sure that violence did not come back to Irish politics.Still, there was a telling admission when the proposals first emerged earlier this week.Reporting on the Irish government’s response, RTE’s Tony Connelly tweeted: “The main argument against this approach is that all the technology in the world is of no usethe actual customs tarf makes your cross-border business unviable, especiallyyou’re in agrood.”In other words, it’s not about the border at all. It’s about maintaining privileged access to the UK market.At present, more than two thirds of all Irish beef exports come to the UK.Understandably, the last thing Dublin wants is for us to switch to cheaper and better beef from Australia, Argentina and the United States — something we would be able to do outside the EU’s trade rules.Many continental countries also want to make sure that Britain remains a captive market for their exporters.So when it became clear that the UK had come up with a way to avoid infrastructure at the Irish border, they moved the goalposts.What they now wanted was not an invisible border, they said, but common rules on both sides of it.Oddly, this applies only one way. No one regarded it as a threat to peace when, for example, the Republic of Ireland left the sterling zone and joined first the ERM and then the euro. But Britain signing its own trade deals is apparently unacceptable.To be fair to Eurocrats, the only reason they put these outrageous demands on the table was because there was a Remainer majority in both Houses of Parliament egging them on.The concept of keeping Britain in the customs union — or of an “Irish backstop” as Brussels officials cunningly called it — only appeared in late , more than a year after the referendum.Why  Because, by then, there had been a new election in the UK and there was now a pro-EU majority in the Commons.Labour and Lib Dem MPs told the EU, quite openly, that they would not let Britain leave except on terms agreed with Brussels — or “not without a deal” as they put it.The EU responded by offering deliberately unpalatable terms.It, like the opposition parties, plainly hopes that,the terms are hard enough, Britain will drop the whole idea of Brexit.As Michel Barnier, the Brexit negotiator, told EU leaders at the start of the process: “I’ll have done my job , by the end, the terms are so hard that the Brits would prefer to stay in.”What, then, will happen now  My guess is that the EU will reject Britain’s offer — even though it achieves all the things Brussels had said were important.It will do so because it believes the alternative is not No Deal — an outcome for which Britain is far better prepared than are the  — but yet another postponement.When MPs voted to make No Deal impossible, they were in fact making a deal impossible, because they were taking away from the EU any incentive to agree terms.If I am right —Brussels rejects the deal, and Parliament then demands another extension — we will be back where we started.But with one critical dference. It will now be obvious to the entire country that Boris was prepared to go as far as any British leader could to find a compromise.It will be clear that neither the EU nor its fth columnists in our own Parliament have any interest in any outcome short of reversing the referendum.Boris, in other words, will be able to go into a general election having demonstrated good faith.He will have done everything possible to leave on good terms, but will have been blocked by MPs who had previously promised to respect the result.Labour and the Lib Dems will, by contrast, have to go into that campaign explaining why, despite their earlier pledges, they now want to drag everything out again.Why they want months or years more of anger and broken friendships, of business uncertainty, and of Britain being made to look ridiculous before the world.

As we are all too aware, their triumph has been overshadowed by a decision to take legal action against The Mail on Sunday over a story that everyone but them had forgotten about and with every chance they might lose.Whoever happens to be right or wrong, I find the situation desperately sad.Meghan and her dad could end up having to face each other in court. It would be the sort of ghastly media circus Harry wants to protect her from. It should never have been allowed to get so out of hand.I believe that they need to think long and hard about what they want for their future happiness and that of their baby son. It would be a huge decision to walk away from public le and become plain Mr and Mrs Windsor, but it may be for the best.I am well aware it’s a dficult one. As new parents, they want to make the world a better place for their baby. They are in a uniquely privileged position to do an incredible amount of good.But we have Harry confessing he finds it tough to get out of bed in the morning and revealing that Meghan has been left bruised and battered by criticism in newspapers and magazines, and presumably by online trolls.So I reckon they need to do some serious soul-searching and ask themselves whether the wounding criticism outweighs the potential for making a dference.I think even Harry would agree that it would be unrealistic of them to expect the kind of North Korean fawning press enjoyed by Kim Jong-un.If they make mistakes they will be called out, and they have made some howlers.Flying on private jets while scolding the rest of us about our carbon footprint is not a good look.“Do as I say and not as I do” muddies the waters and dilutes their good intentions.I do sympathise with Meghan. It must have been upsetting to see a private letter she sent to her father appear in print.But we are told that a desperate Thomas Markle gave itto the newspaper concerned, presumably as some sort of misguided attempt to make contact with his estranged daughter.There’s no denying Thomas has been an idiot, with set-up paparazzi photos, plus interviews bemoaning he has lost touch with Meghan. Every time he opens his mouth, the gulf between them grows wider. Harry hasn’t even met his father-in-law. Even the birth of Archie didn’t heal the rt.If Harry’s mum was alive it would all have been very dferent. Canny Diana would have dazzled Thomas and welcomed him to the family. She would have protected her son and burnished the Meghan and Harry fairytale.Harry mentions his mum in the statement he made justying the decision to take legal action, and he is absolutely spot on about how she was pursued and hounded.It should be pointed out, however, that it was foreign paparazzi out to make a fast buck who pursued her on the night she died. The accident was fatal because she wasn’t wearing a seatbelt and the driver of her car was drunk.Harry must realise that his wonderful Invictus Games and important work highlighting mental health would not be as le-changing or effectivethe media wasn’t there to cover the events.I understand why he is angry. He is protective of his we and finds it unbearable to see her upset.Like most people in the public eye, I have been subjected to deeply distressing and inaccurate media coverage, although nothing remotely on the scale suffered by members of the Royal Family.It’s tempting to hit back, but I’ve always thought it comes with the territory, andyou and those you care about know the truth that’s all that matters.Harry and Meghan are rich enough in their own right to live extremely comfortablythey gave up being royals.They could freely live anywhere in the world and Archie could grow up without any media scrutiny.If they don’t care about the fame and being “celebrities” then surely it’s a no-brainer.It would be a real shame as they have such a lot to offer but no one wants them to be miserable or even resentful.They’ve a whole lot of thinking to do.Since I turned  my mantra has been “a little bit of what you fancy does you good”.In the past decade I haven’t denied myself anythingand as a result have never felt healthier.All things in moderation hasn’t let me down yet and there really is nothing like a bacon roll slathered in butter with a fried egg on top. Unless it is a juicy steak washed down with a very large glass of red.As long as you aren’t ­having deep-fried lard three times a day then I say go for it – and ignore the faddy-food police.AMID the posturing, the bickering, the juvenile name-calling and the sheer ineptitude of our Parliament, there was one shining moment of clarity and authenticity this week.It came in the shape of Labour MP Rosie Duffield, who bravely stood up in the House of Commons and spoke about her own experience during a debate on the domestic abuse bill.It was honest, deeply moving and extremely important.Rosie is an admirable, decent person who articulated not only her own experiences, but also those who have no voice and who might not have bruises but are bleeding inside.She spoke about how abusers seek power and how they control their victims.It left fellow MPs in tears and reminded all of them that there is a hell of a lot more to do than just resolving bloody Brexit.Rosie is the sort of MP we deserve, andthis bill doesn’t go through it will be a national disgrace.I only wish there were more politicians like her.I HAVE been banging on about how deliciously seductive Sky Atlantic’s Succession is since it first burst on to our screens last year, and it looks like everyone  is now catching up.Our own Brian Cox is superb as Logan Roy, the ruthless billionaire who refuses to name the heir to his multinational business.Everyone is hideous, devious, ghastly and selfish, and the whole thing is compulsively addictive, right from the jarring theme tune to the end-of-episode clfhanger.It’s a bit like a really twisted King Lear, and Cox has never been better.This week the whole episode was dedicated to my adopted city of Dundee and the clan descended there from their NY base to “honour” Logan Roy.I was beyond excited to see Dundee University, the Discovery ship and the newly opened VA featured in this glossy, snarky American drama.Only one bum note.Logan’s hideous son Roman tries to wriggle into his father’s good books by buying him a Scottish football team.He merely incurs his wrath by purchasing deadly rivals Hearts instead of Hibs. It would have been far more effectivethe little weasel had bought my beloved Dundee United instead of Hearts.In real le, Cox is a massive Dundee fan and that would have been a wonderful nod to art imitating real le.BIG congrats to Westle’s Mark Feehily and his fiancé Cailean O’Neill, who welcomed their baby girl into the world this week.Mark was always the quiet one in the band, partly because he wasn’t able to talk about being gay when Westle were packaged as heart-throbs for teenage girls.That was back in the late Nineties and how silly it all seems now. Thankfully we have come a long way since then.Mark and Cailean have described themselves as “the happiest dads in the world”.I’m delighted Mark found his soulmate and that they’ve started a family together. I wish them all the very best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was ready to end my le there and then because of the pain.Another sufferer, Tayla Marshall, from Northamptonshire, has to rely on pain relief to cope with her symptoms and is now addicted to strong opioid medication.The -year-old said: I worry every day about my opioid intake. I take ml of morphine sulfate, Fentanyl patches, Naproxen and mg of amitriptyline and although Im not addicted in my mind, my body is physically dependant on this now.She has had multiple operations, two chemically-induced menopauses and is even considering having a hysterectomy when she is .Tayla said she has six years to try for a family - but her condition leaves her unable to be intimate because she is often dosed up on painkillers.The charity Endometriosis UK, which helped gather the womens testimonies, said failing to treat those with the condition is costing the government £.billion a year.It has called on the NHS to wake up and properly implement NICE guidelines to ensure people are getting the right level of care.CEO Emma Cox said: Currently the diagnosis time for endometriosis is an unacceptable . years on average - this must come down.“The potentially devastating impact this condition can have on people’s physical and mental health cannot be overstated.Without investment in research, a reduction in diagnosis time and better access to pain management, women will continue to face huge barriers in accessing the right treatment at the right time.”Minister for Women’s Health, Caroline Dinenage, said: Too often across society womens bodies are seen as an inconvenience, with their symptoms and health concerns not taken seriously enough.One of the main symptoms is painful periods – but the pain is often more severe than ‘normal’ period pain, and lasts from a few days before the period until the end of the period.Many women also have low tummy and pelvic pain, which may be worse before and during a period but can be there all the time.Painful sex – especially during deep penetration – is also a common symptom of endometriosis. This can last for several hours after sex.Penetration and other movements related to sex can pull and stretch endometrial tissue, especiallyit has grown behind the vagina or lower uterus.Endometriosis can also make it harder for you to get pregnant.If you have endometriosis and are trying to get pregnant without success, it is important that you get help and support so speak to your doctor about being referred to a gynaecologist or a fertility specialist.Spotting between periods might not seem like too bothersome a problem but it can be one of the key signs of endometriosis.A study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology showed premenstrual spotting is the clearest predictor of endometriosis.It can also cause pain when you wee or poo and very occasionally blood in the wee or poo.You may also experience fatigue, diarrhoea, constipation, bloating or nausea.Thankfully, awareness of endometriosis and other painful and debilitating menstrual conditions is increasing – but there is still a long way to go.”Centre for Mental Health chief executive, Sarah Hughes, added: Women living with endometriosis deserve support for their mental health as well as for the condition itself and its many effects on a woman’s le.Health services need to wake up to the hidden and unspoken emotional pain too many women experience without the help they need to manage such a poorly understood and distressing condition.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inquest jeremy kyle steve dymond","story":"Lawyers acting on behalf of the -year-old’s relatives insist executives and programme-makers hand over evidence, in the form of emails, video footage and correspondence.The dad-of-one, a machinery operator, was found dead in Portsmouth by his landlady just ten days after taking part in a recording for the show.Mr Dymond is thought to have died of an overdose.The Jeremy Kyle Show was axed following his death in May.He had appeared on the controversial programme to convince his fiance Jane Callaghan that he hadnt been unfaithful, in an attempt to repair their relationship.But they split after he failed a lie detector test.His ex-fiancée Jane claims that Steve was determined to go in front of the cameras despite having underlying health concerns.Mr Dymond first split from his fiancée Jane in February , after she accused him of cheating on her.

But how does the process work While it depends on rank, top officers get full immunity in their host country along with their deputies and families, following laws crafted in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations .This means ambassadors can commit any crime, including murder, and be immune from local law which includes being arrested, prosecuted or being forced to testy in court.They can still be expelled from the country they are based in.This immunity became contentious as when unarmed PC Yvone Fletcher, , died in April  after shots were fired from inside the Libyan Embassy in London at an anti-Gaddafi protest outside.When the siege ended after  days, all Libyan diplomats made their way out of the embassy and were given passage to the airport.The Libyan government accepted “general responsibility” for the shooting  years later and offered compensation to her family, but no one has been convicted for her murder.Customs give diplomats courtesy of ports at airports, which means their luggage can be passed through without inspection.They must still pass through security checkpoints like other travellers, but many are given an express route.A diplomat is an ambassador, envoy or other official whose job is to represent their country while based abroad.This can be split into three main roles involving political, commercial and consular interests.A political diplomat monitors political and economic developments in other countries as well as representing a country in government and the media.Commercial diplomats promote trade and investment, while consular staff assist citizens from their country abroad and process visa applications.Nikesh Mehta currently based at the British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, has also worked in Iraq and Uganda, mingled with British royalty, dined with Hollywood stars and flew to war-torn Basra in Iraq in a Chinook military helicopter.He said: A typical day could involve lobbying on the UN security council resolution on Syria, for example, or it could involve working on a visit for a member of the royal family. Its an incredibly ied workload.Spies are well known to operate in foreign countries under the cover of working as a diplomat.Embassy staff are usually granted diplomatic immunity under international agreements, meaning they will not be prosecuted for breaking laws in the host country. They are likely to be sent home instead.To become a UK diplomat, you would need to apply to the Foreign  Commonwealth Office .Applicants need to pass a strict vetting test and meet nationality and residency requirements.People from all backgrounds are welcome to apply but they may be asked for GCSEs, A levels and a degree.No formal qualications are needed but many staff are expected to speak the language of the country they are based in.Christopher Meyer, the ex-UK ambassador in Washington DC at the time of the Iraq War in , once suggested a good diplomat needs “a quick mind, a hard head, a strong stomach, a warm smile and a cold eye”.It is expected you would have relevant work or le experience. Promotion could see you earn £k a year within five years.The FCO employs around , staff - from  nationalities - around the world.Around one third are made up of UK-based British civil servants whose career includes work in the UK and postings overseas.The remainder are employed by a British diplomatic mission abroad.The FCO has a network of  ministerial posts in  countries.Diplomatic number plates are issued to vehicles used by diplomats in the UK.They follow a simple pattern and are designed to be instantly recognisable.They all have three digits, a letter D, and three more digits.The first three digits tell you what country the diplomat represents, the D is for diplomat and the last three digits are for internal identication.Administrative staff - non-diplomatic staff who work on diplomatic missions - follow the same format, but with an X instead of a D."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now! px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" And dont forget to check out the all-new Sun Mobile app - with an amazing facelt, the new app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own homepage.Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there are also dogging hotspots all over the place.”Officials are particularly concerned that home-grown drivers will engage in dogging – watching people have sex in vehicles - with one minister remarking that there was “something deeply British” about the X-rated activity.This is not the first time dogging has crossed over into the world of politics.In  Nick Clegg inadvertently visited a sex site in Scotland after an embarrassing blunder by his former campaign manager Ben Rathe.Mr Rathe picked the Cathkin Marsh beauty spot as the location for the Deputy PM to unveil his p plastic bag charge policy.However, he was unaware that just weeks earlier two male OAPs were caught engaging in an “unsavoury act” in a bird hide there.Mr Rathe – who is now press secretary for Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson – recalled in his blog that he only discovered his mistake when he spoke to local police during a security check.The cop remarked: “Interesting place for a visit. It’s a dogging site.”Mr Rathe said: “Just four weeks before our conference, two pensioners had been caught doing ‘unsavoury’ things to one another in the very bird hut I’d signed off as a suitable location.“The next morning came, and off went the deputy prime minister and lord president of the council ... To a dogging site.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eu wont engage until boris election","story":"His new Brexit proposal is a big move, but it still isn’t enough for the EU and Dublin. They still object to anything that leads to checks on the island of Ireland, as the UK scheme would do.No say there is the “potential for some meetings next week”. There is, though, little optimism about what will come from them.Even the biggest optimists in Downing Street think there is only a one in four chance of getting a deal, and these odds are ening by the hour.There is doubt that the process will even make it into the “tunnel”, the EU’s term for intensive serious negotiations.One No source tells me: “We’re not going to get into the tunnel without more compromise but we’re getting to the limit of what we can do.”There are TWO ESSENTIAL PROBLEMS. Firstly, Theresa May gave away so much with the original backstop.The Irish and the EU, understandably, object to the UK giving up on commitments it made in both the Joint Report of December  and the Withdrawal Agreement.But this means the perfectly reasonable proposition that the UK should be able to leave the EU with its customs territory INTACT is seen as unreasonable.It should be noted that at Cabinet on Thursday several ministers, notably Theresa Villiers and Andrea Leadsom, expressed concern at just how much the Government was conceding in this offer.Secondly the EU know thatno agreement can be reached, that doesn’t mean the UK leaves without a deal on October , but there is an extension. Why  Because the Benn Act saysthere is No Deal, the UK Government must ask the EU for an extension of its membership.This takes the pressure off Dublin. It means they know the choice now isn’t between Boris’ offer and No Deal, but between this offer and an extension.This creates an almost irresistible temptation to take the extension and seea general election changes things.After all,you think — as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar does — that the UK would vote to Remain in a second referendum, why not take your chances with that I understand thatthe UK and the EU were close to an agreement, the Government would be prepared to hold a vote in Parliament to reassure Brussels its plan could pass. But with little sign of a deal, it doesn’t see the point.If Boris is to get the EU to take his Brexit offer seriously, he will have to win an election. A majority in Parliament would show both that he could pass a deal and that the UK would leave without a dealone could not be reached.In these circumstances, he would have a real shot at getting the EU to engage seriously with him.But, as Michael Gove fretted at Cabinet this week, there is a danger that the Irish government ends up rejecting pragmatic solutions as it finds it politically easier to accept No Deal and blame the Brits.Brexit isn’t going to be over by the end of this month. There is going to have to be a general election before this deadlock can be broken.THE mystery of what the Government intends to do about the Benn Act is deepening.In a submission to a Scottish Court this week, No said it would send a letterthere is no deal by October   and that it wouldn’t try to subvert the act.Yet at Cabinet this week, Boris Johnson told Esther McVey that the Government had four or five extremely good plans for dealing with the Benn Act. When challenged by another minister, Boris  said that “some of them are cunning plans”.But what could they be Well, the submission to the court appears to rule out saying that another piece of law trumps the Benn Act.  One senior Downing Street source tells me thatthe Government has to send the letter, then the EU will have to send for its lawyers to understand it.My information is that Downing Street thinks that the fact that the European Council and Commission deal with governments – not parliaments – gives it some flexibility both before and after the letter is sent.For instance, the letter that the Benn Act requires the PM to send doesn’t set out any reason for the extension and the EU has always said it would want to know what the purpose of any delay was.It also does not say that the UK will not disrupt the EU’s own proceedings – something Theresa May committed to, to get her two extensions.But it is still hard to imagine that the EU would refuse to grant an extensionthe letter was sent.No Deal would be disastrous for Ireland and it is hard to imagine the EU going for that option rather than an extension.Stewart, who has quit the Tories to run as an independent, has a mountain to climb to defeat the Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan next May.But with the campaign of the Tory candidate Shaun Bailey a cause of despair for senior Tories, Stewart has a chance to seize second place.A good campaign and a strong second place would get Stewart noticed.It would put him in a stronger position to either set up a new type of party, something he is very keen to do, or to negotiate histo the ToriesBrexit is done by then.THE Business Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has written to Cabinet colleagues asking for agreement to offer more than £million of public backing to Ataer Holdingsit takes over British Steel.If British Steel can be saved it would preserve several thousand jobs.But there will be worries that this proposal will open the Government up to demands that they help out other struggling firms. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mum-of-two Maria Hopkins, , was beaten so badly by Ricky Wilding that she was left eating through a syringe after sustaining a broken jaw and her spine was fractured. Maria, from Swindon, said her injuries were so horrying that her own children did not recognise her, and were scared of her. The -year-old father of her two children was jailed for six years and eight months for the sickening attack which happened in July.    But now, in a more detailed letter released through Wiltshire Police, Maria, has shared further details of her terrying ordeal and pleaded with other victims to come forward. She said she only became angry at Wilding after she saw him smirking in court, and looking proud of the damage he had caused. She wrote: When he was given his prison sentence, and he walked out of the court, that was it. It was all over and I could focus on moving on. I know that so many people think it is impossible to escape an abusive relationship, especially those who have children, but it is so important to prioritise their wellbeing as well as your own. It can happen to any relationship behind closed doors. If I can help one other person in a similar position to me then it will be worth it. Maria, who is mum to a five-year-old daughter and three-year-old son, met Ricky when she was , whilst in Year  at school. She wrote: We were good friends at first and a few months later it became more of a relationship. We got on well and it was fine, he was just how you would expect a boyfriend to be, considerate and thoughtful. I had no concerns.      In , I gave birth to our daughter. About a year later, I noticed his behaviour started to slip. He wasnapost violent and he didnapost smoke, drink or take drugs, and we didnapost argue, but his tone towards me in everyday conversations started to change. He almost had to have a say on everything and became really jealous - I was never really allowed to go out with friends. Maria continued: In , we had our son, but Rickyaposs behaviour went rapidly downhill the following year. When our daughter was born he was really excited, like a typical doting dad. But he was dferent this time. The only way I can describe it is like a switch had been flicked.  The first time he hit me I was really shocked, I never expected that from him. Over time, I became accustomed to it, it almost became normal le to me. On July  this year, long after we had split up, Ricky turned up unannounced at my house.  He thought I had a new boyfriend and asked to see my phone, but I refused. He became aggressive so I locked him out the house - from my past experience with him, I knew he had a tendency to switch and he was clearly getting wound up. But he kicked the door in and attacked me, smashing my head against the TV unit so hard itaposs left a dent in the wood.  He then stamped on my head several times before taking my sisteraposs phone from her so she couldnapost call the police. I was unconscious so I canapost remember exactly what happened but my sister managed to get outside and call for help. Maria was taken to John Radclfe Hospital in Oxford, where she had to have a number of operations for a broken jaw and fractured spine - including a permanent metal plate fitted to her jaw.  She wrote: I could only eat with a syringe for weeks after and my jaw will never be straight again. I force it in to placeI think about it, but when I smile in pictures my face isnapost straight anymore and I can only eat on one side.  I never really felt angry towards Ricky about what happened because I was just so focused on recovering from the surgery that I hadnapost given him a second thought. The next time I saw him was when I went to court to see him sentenced.  That is the first time I felt angry towards him because he was smirking and he almost looked proud of what he had done.  When the Judge was reading out details of the surgery I had required, Ricky looked proud that someone had needed surgery as a result of his actions, and proud of the damage he had caused.  That was when the anger set in and the realisation that he, of all people, had done that to me. I wanted to go to court because I wanted closure, she added. When he was given his prison sentence, and he walked out of the court, that was it. It was all over and I could focus on moving on. Iaposm now in a new relationship which I never thought would happen. If you told me I would meet someone while I was in my hospital bed I would have laughed.  What I have been through has definitely affected me, itaposs made me more wary, and I worry a lot about how things I say and do are perceived. Iaposve spoken to my daughter about what has happened. She is young but she understands. I was advised to talk to her, because the last thing I would want is for her to find out about her daddy from someone at school, she continued. My son is too young but I will speak to him when he gets a bit older. I donapost want them to grow up with the burden on their shoulders of who their dad is and what he has done to their mum. If they can be told at a young age, they can start to process it and understand that itaposs not who they are and his actions do not define them. The police have been so helpful to me, the Detective Constable assigned to my case has kept me well informed throughout the whole court process, which has been really helpful. Iaposd urge anyone to report information to the policethey are in an abusive relationship.

The most deceitful Prime Minister in living memory is orchestrating a giant con job, chanting his “Get Brexit Done” manta with the dishonesty of an immoral fraudster who doesn’t know right from wrong. Apply to politics the legal, decent, honest and truthful tests applied by the Advertising Standards Authority to traders flogging blueberries or pet insurance and Johnson would be fined a packet. Brexit is far more likely to be an expensive calamity than the gt he pretends, yet Johnson’s immediate dishonesty is maintaining that Britain will be out of Europe on Hallo­­ween, without explaining how. Theresa May declared  times we’d be out by March  this year, so maybe he’s going for her record before conceding an October  defeat.    Labour and opposition parties striving to take back control of Parliament to ensure the tinpot tyrant obeys the law doesn’t distract from an uncomfortable truth – lying all of the time to some of the people is working for the Fake News PM.

Denise Ohnona, who dreamed of gracing the catwalk when she was a teenager, thought her chance had been snatched from her when the car she was travelling in was hit by a bus. Now, aged , she is finally living her dream. And Denise has relived the horrying moment she awoke to see the damage caused to her face by the collision.She told the Liverpool Echo : When I first looked in the mirror at my reflection in the hospital and saw my face I screamed. I started to cry as soon as I saw it.    Up to that point she had been working as a retail assistant. She then received a call from a modelling agency offering her work - and the new opportunity meant she was able to sign to the firm and start a new career. However on October , , just days after the phone call, Denise found her dreams being crushed when she was involved in a horric road accident. She said: Iaposd been in Liverpool during the day, but I decided to stay over which is something I never normally would do. My boyfriend at the time picked me up and the city was just like a ghost town, it felt like something was going to happen. We’d been in the car for about  seconds and then a double-decker bus crashed into us.    In the impact of the collision, Denise was forced across the passenger seating, hitting the steering wheel. She said: My head was pouring with blood, I was screaming. It was completely split in every way - my cheek was pretty much hanging off. Tragically, the road accident left Denise with permanent facial scars. Heartbroken by what had happened, she found herself becoming a recluse. She said: After the accident, I wasnapost going out at all. I’d changed, I wasnapost the person I used to be. I was put on anti-depressants. When I ed to my job at Next, I went to work in the office in the back - I couldn’t face people. I wouldn’t even go to the supermarket on my own, I needed someone to hold my hand. I never wanted to be in the limelight, my scars couldn’t even be covered up with makeup as I suffer from hypertrophic scarring.  Over the next  years, Denise would start the slow progression back to normality. She said: I moved back home and joined the gym and started weightlting. The biggest thing for me was quitting sugar. Denise also became a mother to two girls. She added: People were still interested in me to do jobs as a model. My boyfriend would say to me that I should start it again, but I didnapost want to with the scars on my face. It would only be in January this year that Denise, now -years-old, would reignite her teenage dreams.

Thomas Markle yesterday told why he felt forced to release details of a private letter sent to him by his daughter Meghan which is now at the centre of a bitter UK legal battle. Sources close to him say he is ready to travel to the UK to defend his actions. An insider said: “It is tragic how Tom didn’t come to Meghan’s wedding yet his first brush with anything royal could be in one of Her Majesty’s courts. “Tom speaking out to defend his actions [over the letter] shows his intent, he is adamant he was justied.” The potential court case is yet another twist in the bitter estrangement between Meghan and her father. The retired Hollywood lighting director, who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, failed to walk the Duchess, , down the aisle at Windsor Castle in May last year after having a heart attack.  Thomas, , was hospitalised days after he was exposed for faking pictures with the paparazzi. The pair have not seen each other since . He has never met his son-in-law Harry or grandson, Archie. The Duchess is suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing the highly personal note. Her solicitors filed papers last week claiming to publish the letter was a breach of , infringed her privacy and was a breach of the Data Protection Act. Meghan could be called by the paper to be cross-examined while her father appears as a witness for the defence. She is facing claims she invaded her own privacy after her US friends provided details of the letter’s contents to an American celeb magazine. Pals of the royal spoke to a journalist from People after Meghan had reportedly sanctioned the move. She could now be forced to swear on oath whether she did.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum says she finds surrogacy as an aposaddictionapos and after giving birth to her own niece she wants to do it again. Jenna Newell, , from Llanelli, recently decided to give her cousin a child of their own after they struggled to naturally conceive. Jenna decided to do it while pregnant with her second child, reports Wales Online. She gave birth to her daughter and less than six months later she was pregnant with her cousinaposs child. There are two types of surrogacy traditional and gestational. Traditional is where the surrogateaposs own eggs are used, and gestational is where a sperm and egg from others are used, sometimes from the Intended Parents . Initially, Jenna was hoping to go down the gestational surrogacy route.    Jenna said: I signed up to  surrogacy UK , and it was after I had revealed this to my family that my cousin came forward and told me they were having trouble conceiving. I had no idea. At first we were looking into getting an egg donated, but when we realised how much more medical intervention was involved, we decided to go for a traditional surrogacy. It worked out as my cousin would then have a biological link to the baby. Traditional surrogacy can be initiated at home with an insemination method, but Jenna and the Intended Parents opted to go to a clinic. The fact it was my egg didnapost change my feelings about the surrogacy. We were done having our children after our two and I was considering egg donation anyway. Jennaaposs family were initially sceptical about the idea of surrogacy. She added: My husband always knew from when we met that I wanted to be a surrogate, but he never thought it would happen. When we found out my cousin wanted a baby, but was struggling, he said I just had to do it. He was always worried that I would be a surrogate for a couple and then they would just leave with the baby, and I would have no contact or relationship, but this way we knew I wouldnapost feel used.  My parents were initially a bit worried about the idea, but as soon as they realised it was for someone they knew they were really happy about it. Before Jenna knew of her cousinaposs fertility issues she had been in talks with a couple who lived a seven-hour drive away. She said: It didnapost work out as I was worried they would have missed the birth as they were so far away, and also you have to build up that trust to know you would get updates or stay in touch. Iaposm not there to be a parent at all, but Iaposve heard stories of surrogates who have never heard from the family again and have felt used. During the surrogacy process Jenna ran a blog called Then There Were Three and signed up to exclusively surrogate Facebook groups to try to build relationships with fellow women going through the same thing. Sometimes you would get someone slip through the net, Jenna said, adding two days after I gave birth to my niece I had a message askingcould be their surrogate, at that point I was like, aposerm, noapos. This wasnapost the only message like this that Jenna received. I had a message from one woman which said that she had bad morning sickness in her pregnancy and could I have her next one for her, then even someone asking how much I charge which was ridiculous. In the UK is it illegal to advertise for a surrogate and to pay them. Surrogacy is technically a gt, although any expenses for the surrogate are expected to be paid by the intended parents, so that the surrogate is not out of pocket by the process.    The expenses can include fuel and parking for attending appointments, loss of earnings, maternity clothing, pregnancy vitamins and food for cravings. Jenna said: Usually, average expenses for a surrogacy in the UK can range from £, to £,, but the only thing we needed really was for loss of earnings for my husband as he took a week off work once the baby was born for my recovery, and my cousin drove me to most appointments and bought me vitamins. I also had maternity clothes from my most recent pregnancy so that saved lots of money. Aside from the creation of a new family, there is another aspect to surrogacy, filled with legal admin. Both Jenna and her husband, along with the Intended Parents, had to adjust their wills so, for example,Jenna passed away, none of her estate would be left to the new baby. Legally in the UK, Jenna and her husband had legal rights over the baby until a Parental Order was able to go through the courts, which took  months after the birth. It was scary and annoying, Jenna recalled. I had to go and register the birth, and until the baby was six weeks old, it was myself and my husband who had to go on the birth certicate, because we are married, even though we werenapost the parents. I had to give consent to my cousin for her to register the baby at the doctors. It makes me grateful that I decided to do surrogacy with someone I already knew and trusted and vice versa, as legally the surrogate can have the final say and change their minds, as could the intended parents, leaving you with a baby you werenapost expecting, but that is very rare.    The service Jenna experienced medically, she said, was incredible. When I was  weeks pregnant my midwe asked my cousinshe intended to breastfeed, which not many people know is possible. She was referred straight away to induce lactation and was eventually able to successfully breastfeed. Even at the hospital, after I gave birth, they had to put tags on the baby to match my own name, but they also gave tags to mum that match the baby too. Itaposs something that is so lovely to keep and I know it meant a lot to her. Jenna was allowed three people in the birthing room with her her husband and the Intended Parents. The midwives allowed the IPs to make the decision of delayed cord clamping and the mother was told to remove her top so that the baby could be put straight on her skin.

Inside is the final heartbeaking love letter from we Tanya, written before she lost her cancer battle. The former footballer admits he was left in pieces after reading it. He said: “I broke down. Now, I take it everywhere I go so Tanya is always with me.” Tanya, , wrote the card in July, as her le slipped away, to give Vinnie strength in the days after her death from cancer. The actor said: “She left it with her precious diaries. “Inside she had written: ‘To my love Vin, something wonderful happens to me every day. It’s being with you. You are my morning sunshine the moment I wake. All my love, Tanya.’ I broke down when I read it because I loved her like that too.”    Sobbing, Vinnie said he is counting the days until he is reunited with the love of his le. And he has bought an adjacent cemetery plot so his ashes can be buried alongside Tanya’s. Tanya endured a six-year battle after being diagnosed with melanoma in  but last year it spread to her brain. In today’s Sunday Mirror, -year-old Vinnie revealed he believes he was visited by her spirit in the hours after her death in July.  He now believes she is waiting for him in the afterle. Vinnie said: “I’m content to crash through the rest of my le in Heaven’s waiting room until Tanya calls me. The rest of my le is not a long timewe are going to be together for eternity. “But I want to live to do the right thing by our daughter, Kaley, and Tanya’s family. “But she’ll call me when the time is right.”  Vinnie and Tanya met when they were children in their hometown of Watford. He said: “I can’t rememberI fancied her straight away but she was always very striking.” But the pair never got together until after Tanya’s first marriage to footballer Steve Terry broke down. By then, issues with her health were already beginning to loom. She almost died in childbirth with Kaley, who Vinnie later adopted, and had to have an emergency heart transplant. When he asked Tanya’s dad Lou, now ,he could marry her, he warned him le would be dficult because of her health. But he was unperturbed. Vinnie recalled: “Lou asked meI knew what I was taking on because Tanya was not a well lady. But I promised him I loved her and that never changed and never will.”  Tanya never spoke about dying or her wishes for her funeral throughout her fight. Vinnie added: “I begged doctors not to tell her she was nearing the end when things got really bad. “We just couldn’t talk about her dying because I just couldn’t accept it.” But that tragic moment did arrive. Speaking of Tanya’s funeral, Vinnie said: “Hundreds packed into our local church in LA, where we had built our le, to say goodbye. Another memorial was held in the UK, she was so loved.” Tanya was cremated and her ashes buried in LA’s Forest Lawn Cemetery. Vinnie said. “There’s a tree next to her plot for Kaley to sit under. I’ve already bought the plot next to her so my ashes can be buried there too, and we can be together forever.”  Tanya died weeks after the couple’s th wedding anniversary in June, which she spent in intensive care. They had planned to mark the occasion by flying family and friends from the UK for a New Year’s Eve party in LA but Tanya didn’t make it. Vinnie said: “While Tanya was going through chemo, she’d stop treatment for a month so she could enjoy Christmas. But she always had to have something to look forward to and she wanted to celebrate our anniversary on New Year’s Eve. She booked all the flights. “We’re going ahead with the plans. It will be tough but it’s what she would have wanted.”  The festive period for Vinnie will also be tainted with sad memories. It was last Christmas Eve, the couple received a call from Tanya’s doctor, who broke the dreadful news the cancer had spread to her brain. Vinnie said: “We broke down in each other’s arms. It was the first time we really both broke down. That was when Tanya knew it could be her last Christmas. She said, ‘I want to have a fantastic Christmas, what can they do ’ The doctors gave her steroids. She was hugging friends and family and saying, ‘Every moment is precious.’ I think they maybe knew.” "},{"url":null,"title":"best man pulls hilarious prank","story":"NewsBest man pulls hilarious prank on groom by dressing up as bride for first lookBilly Hunt was shocked to see his best friend, Pat Jones, in a white bridal gown when he turned around on his wedding dayShareByChiara Fiorillo:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video best-man-pulls-hilarious-prank-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news best-man-pulls-hilarious-prank-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Uncapped Motherwell defender Declan Gallagher has already been called in.Clarke also lost Leeds defender Liam Cooper with Kilmarnock’s Stuart Findlay named in his place.On whether McKenna would be available for a Scotland call-up, Docherty said: “We would need to monitor that and speak with the physios.“It is something the management team and medical team would need to make a decision on.“I am sure there will be conversations about that later.“For the moment the squad has been named and Scott wasn’t in it.”McKenna has been a regular starter for the Scots andfit would have been set to face Russia and San Marino.It is understood Clarke has been in regular contact with Aberdeen and McKenna.It was agreed that due to having only had a few days training, McKenna would be allowed to work with Aberdeen this week.However, Clarke could yet move to hand a late call-up to McKenna to bring experience to his backline.Hearts centre-back John Souttar is also out injured.Docherty said: “Scott did fantastically well and only ed to training in the latter stages of the week.“He put his body on the line after being out for quite a while.“Scott got through the  minutes and will be tired.“We monitored Scott on Thursday and Friday and in discussions with him he thought he could give it a go. You saw with his performance that he has the heart of a lion.“He will get through anything and did his bit for the team.”Aberdeen battled back from a goal down and a man down to salvage a draw with Hibs.They were down to  men following a straight red card to Curtis Main moments after Hibs had gone - up.The Dons secured a late equaliser with a Sam Cosgrove header although Lewis Ferguson was also sent off in injury-time.Following the - defeat to Rangers manager Derek McInnes received flak from angry supporters.It was the heaviest loss of McInnes’ six-and-a-half years at Pittodrie and some supporters went to the extreme of questioning the manager’s future at the club.Docherty insists the Dons, and the Red Army, are lucky to have McInnes at the helm. And he called for the critics to wake up to that.Docherty said: “We are lucky at Aberdeen football club that we have a manager in Derek McInnes.“A lot of people need to realise that. The amount of solid, sterling work that has been done.“Sometimes when you are in a situation like that it brings out the best in people.“It made them stand up and show their personality which is a reflection of the manager.“A lot of questions had been raised from the last performance in terms of the team’s personality and mentality.“What they did is reflect the manager’s personality and mentality in that last  minutes.“It speaks volumes of the squad as they weren’t giving it up.”Main and Ferguson will both be suspended for the upcoming game against Motherwell and Celtic following their dismissals.Docherty said: “I think hisreaction to the Curtis Main tackle influenced the referee.“I didn’t think it was a red card for Ferguson.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45890269-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45890269-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45890269-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45890269-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"sam cosgrove heads late equalizer for 10 man aberdeen against hibs","story":"Aberdeen came back from a goal and a man down to salvage a draw against Hibs.The Reds went into this match reeling from a humiliating - loss to Rangers at Ibrox.Although they did not beat Hibs there was at least the fight, passion and battle that was missing to such damage against Rangers.Aberdeen were up against it going into the final minutes having gone behind to a Ryan Porteous goal early in the second half.It got worse as Curtiss Main was sent off minutes later.However Aberdeen kept battling away and were rewarded when Sam Cosgrove headed home a late equalizer.However only the poor finishing of Doidge prevented Hibs winning.Dons boss Derek McInnes made four changes to the side that were over-run at Ibrox with -year-old Ethan Ross coming in for his first start.Scotland international defender Scott McKenna ed to the starting line-up after five weeks out with a hamstring tear.McKenna only ed to training on Wednesday but was given the all clear to go straight back into the team.Striker Curtis Main and defender Andy Cosidine, who was a late withdrawal for Ibrox with illness, ed to the starting line up.Dropping out were Mikey Devlin, Zak Vyner, Connor McLennan and Niall McGinn.Hibs created the first opportunity in the fourth minute when Christian Doidge  was played clean through on goal but keeper Joe Lewis raced off his line to block the eight yard shot.Aberdeen threatened in the th minute when left back Greg Leigh latched onto a corner delivered to Ryan Hedges to the near post but his  yard header flew wide.Moments later Curits Main drilled a low shot across the face of goal. With keeper Chris Maxwell stranded at his neer post all it needed was a tap in for a goal.However no Aberdeen player was in a situation to capitalize in front of goal.In the th minute Lewis Ferguson fired in a powerful  yard drive but it was straight at keeper Maxwell who comfortably saved,Moments later Hedges shot over from the edge of the penalty area as Aberdeen began to press.Hibs went ahead in the th minute when a corner kick fell to defender Ryan PORTEOUS who took a touch then fired beyond keeper Lewis from  yards out.Aberdeen were deservedly leading. A bad day for the Dons got even worse when Main received a straight red card for a challenge on Stevie Mallan where he jumped into the challenge and appeared to catch his foot with his studs.Red was harsh on Main.Yet again captain Lewis came to the rescue when Doidge was one on one but the keeper raced off his line and brilliantly blocked his  yard shot.McGinn#s cross from the left finds Hedges who lays the ball back to Gallagher. He finds himself some space in the box but he shoots over the bar.In the th minute Hedges slid the eball to substitute Jon Gallagher who turned quickly in the box to open up space but blasted over from  yards.Hibs should have doubled their advantage in the th minute when Doidge, who had looked offsside when collecting the ball, was played one on one with Lewis.Instead of squaring to the onrushing Scott Allan for what would surely have been a goal he opted to shoot and Lewis raced off his line to make another vital save.Moments later Hedges fired in a vicious  yard drive that cracked off the near post.A man down Aberdeen equalized in the th minute when COSGROVE raced onto a corner from Niall McGinn to bullet in a header from  yards.Deep into injury time Aberdeen were reduced to  men when Ferguson was red carded for a challenge on Mallan.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Logan, Leigh, Considine, McKenna, Ferguson, Campbell, E.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"world champion pipe band hops to it","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCairndow brewery Fyne Ales has teamed up with Inveraray and District Pipe Bandto brew a special beer in celebration of their recent world championship win.The new batch of Piper’s Gold, one of Fyne Ales# classic recipes, was brewed with a helping hand from IDPB’s Pipe Major Stuart Liddell and piper Johan Van Der Wal, who visited the farm in September to help with the brew day and play a few reels for lucky visitors to the Fyne Ales# Brewery Tap and shop.#We were thrilled the band were keen to work with us on a brew and Piper’s Gold was really the only thing we could make after their incredible win last month,# said Fyne Ales managing director Jamie Delap.The pipers weren’t afraid to get their hands dirty alongside head brewer Malcolm Downie on the original Fyne Ales kit, where Piper’s Gold was first brewed in the early s, and even popped over to help add the hops on the big kit where Mills and Hills was being brewed.#It’s been really interesting to learn about the brewing process and there’s definitely a parallel with the pipes # in brewing, it’s all about controlling the iables # adding the right amount of malt, or getting the hops added at the right time or a tiny in iation in temperature can massively change what the final beer is like and in piping it’s the same, it’s about controlling the iables,# added Stuart.The day concluded with a drive along the glen accompanied by Fyne Ales farmer Stu MacLachlan who joined the champions with his own pipes for a few tunes in the hills of Glen Fyne."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day. During our visit there was nothing unusual moving over the sea but the warden accounted for an adult Pomarine Skua, a Manx Shearwater and four Red-breasted Merganser. Then at .am the next day another birder had a Sabinersquos Gull with Kittiwakes and an Artic Skua.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

I was telling him there used to be a path in places but we couldn#t see one because it was so overgrown.#It means so much to me because of my mate and I#ll be up again next year, but it puts you off.#John, who runs a walking club in Scotstoun, believes the route needs to be better promoted and supported by the local community.#Walkers can stay in Carradale or Clachan, for example, so hotels should support the Kintyre Way,# he said. #It opens up the islands like Gigha and Arran as well. If the walk is not maintained, people won#t do it, and that#s a lost opportunity.#The company which formerly administered the Kintyre Way, The Long and Winding Way Ltd, closed down in  due to financial dficulties.Alan Milstead, convener of the Kintyre Way, the Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation which now maintains the route, told the Courier he sympathised with John.

However we have been working on a new website – now active at www.thekintyreway – and we are looking to incorporate a problem reporting system.#We’ve had good support from Scottish Natural Heritage, Forestry and Land Scotland and another few charities but we were turned down by two local funds and we just haven’t been able to maintain the upkeep as a result.#Looking forward, however, we remain positive about the future of the Kintyre Way.#Alan added that anyone who wishes to help or support the Kintyre Way can email thekintyreway@gmail to find out more."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrations-mark-25-years-port-seton-centre","story":"The centrersquos management committee and staff held the weekend of celebrations on August -.They began in the main hall on the Friday evening with the community awards .

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10459949.jpg?type=article-full","title":"guide-scotlands-best-seafood-experiences","story":"The Seafood Ristorante, St AndrewsLocated in an iconic lsquoglass boxrsquo, the Seafood Ristorante relaunched in March  and isnow one of Scotlandrsquos premium dining venues.

We save carbon because we make a really high quality energy efficient system but the biggest impact is that we knock about a quarter of the construction carbon footprint off the average UK house because we store more carbon in the products than the amount that was needed to make them.IndiNaturersquos production is estimated to use around an eighth less energy than standard glass and rock wool insulation, and their use of naturally carbon storing crops that pull carbon dioxide from the air makes their material almost carbon neutral.The industrial hemp and flax crops are naturally resilient too, taking unexpected weather iations such as flooding in their stride.Currently the supply chain is based in the north of England but Scottish farmers who want to revive the traditional crops previously used to supply the navy with anchor ropes and rigging are in talks with the company.It was while renovating his own home with eco materials that Mr Simpson discovered that not all sustainable building products are created equally.After importing apparently eco insulation, he noticed that it was bound with petro-plastics, negating the companyrsquos environmental credentials.He said: ldquoI thought I was doing the eco thing but when I read the text-sheet it said it used petro-chemicals and it was eye wateringly expensive so I thought, why donrsquot we do this here in Scotland With a background in community development, Mr Simpson worked in housing and saw people living in ldquoterrible conditions.He said: ldquoHouses were damp, [people] couldnrsquot afford to heat them, there was black mould and fuel poverty.It was during a masters in Sustainable Architecture that Mr Simpson started developing the materials he now uses to produce the insulation he thinks will revolutionise the construction industry.He said: ldquoI thought,you can solve the built environment problem, you can solve a lot of problems.ldquoIf you know to design the built environment in a holistic way with sustainable materials that will have a huge impact on peoplersquos health and reduce the impacts on the environment.A site had been secured in Hawick to build their first factory, close to their farm supply chain. As well as working with Scottish farmers in the future, IndiNature hope to boost employment in the area.The insulation can be retro-fitted into homes and businesses, allowing for current social housing developments to benefit from the technology. Mr Simpson is in talks with local authorities, contractors and big firms who ldquoknow they need to move into the sector.The company has plans for expansion with their global replication model that will build factories overseas.Mr Simpson said: ldquoI used to be involved with building nice little bespoke homes for wealthy people which is great but there was nothing being done on an industrial scale.ldquoGlobally we aim to be a pound million plus business but with one factory wersquore looking at a poundm turnover.\""},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-thousands-independence-supporters-march-edinburgh","story":"Organisers of All Under One Bannerevent in Edinburgh confirmed that Saturdayrsquos demonstration was the biggest one yet, estimating that over , people took part.Men, women, children and pets were draped in Saltires, waving flags, bagpipes and lsquoYesrsquo banners as they walked from Holyrood Park to the Meadows.The First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was absent during the march but took to Twitter to tell supporters that she was there lsquoin spiritrsquo.:Everything you need to know about All Under One Banner march in Edinburgh on SaturdayShe said: ldquoGood luck to everyone marching for independence in Edinburgh later.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"dav\"  Residents urged to support Recycle Week viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

He stated that the application went against ious aspects of council planning policy. He had been seconded by Councillor Owen Tierney.Councillors then voted by ten votes to four to approve the development.• A planning application for the erection of   kV electricity substation at Dounreay, Caithness, which connects to the subsea cable across the Pentland Firth and forms part of the high voltage electricity transmission network and the “National Development”, was consented on September  by Highland Council.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While Be Reasonable Scotland is concerned this new law will turn ‘good’ parents into criminals.This is a concern I share. I have vivid memories of my mum walloping me as a mouthy teenager – but should she have been prosecuted  Absolutely not, she was a great mum, and will be mortiedshe reads this article.: Scotland becomes first part of UK to ban smacking of children: Smacking laws in Scotland: current regulations, proposed changes and how the rest of the UK matches upBack in the s, hitting your kids was standard practice. Things have changed since then, as has language we use. We now talk about ‘smacking’ children, as opposed to hitting them just as we call those things we put our expensive cross-breed puppies in, crates instead of cages. It softens the blow, so to speak.Smacking our own kidsThe fact is, many of us have been driven to give our kids a smack at some point. According to a report by four leading Scottish children’s charities around % of parents in the UK have used physical punishment, with children aged three to seven the most likely to be on the receiving end.The numbers don’t surprise me. Nor do the ages of the children, as this is the time when parenting can be the most challenging. My son was three when I smacked him. Six years on, it still makes me shudder with regret.We were at the start of our holiday and had been travelling for around eight hours. I needed to change his nappy, but he wouldn’t let me. He wouldn’t stop shouting, he wouldn’t listen, he wouldn’t do a single thing I asked. So, in desperation, I smacked his very well padded bottom .And you know what  He stopped. Everything went quiet. And for a split second I felt relief. And victory. But then he turned to me and said ‘don’t you hit me’. Well, he did have a point… And then we both sobbed.A flash of furyThe essential problem with smacking or hitting your child is that it’s done in a moment of madness. It’s a flash of fury and frustration, when all other options have failed.This is what ‘time out’ was created for. It’s not just about punishing the child, it’s about giving the parent time to take a breath and calm their thoughts. There are countless times I have shut myself in the kitchen cupboard, so I can silently scream into the fridge, or bang my head against the cornflakes.I will do everything I can to avoid hitting my children because I know, in my gut, that violence is wrong. I tell me children on a daily basis not to hit each other, so how can I justy doing the same to them  We shouldn’t hit our children just because society or the law say it’s ok, or because they aren’t big enough to hit us back.In fact that is the very reason we shouldn’t hit them.

This is a fight not just for the twelve hundred workers facing redundancy but for the future of Ballymena. It is not a fight we can afford to lose.”At the weekend a major protest was held at the gates of Green Pastures Church where Wrightbus main shareholder, Jeff Wright, is lead pastor.Hundreds of ex-employees yesterday attended a redundancy clinic in Ballymena following the firms collapse. Former workers queued to fill in claim forms almost a week after the bus manufacturer crashed into administration.The Wright family, who founded the bus-making company in , said the collapse of the business was due to a big fall in demand for buses in the UK market.Meanwhile, a debate in Westminster yesterday heard calls for bus operators to be encouraged with economic assistance to buy British.DUP MP Ian Paisley pushed for the commitment after seeking assurances that potential investors in Wrightbus know what British government support looks like, in terms of research and development, soft loans or grants.Asking an urgent question in the Commons, Mr Paisley asked Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith: Could he recognise that the arms- bodies, such as Translink and First Group and other bus buyers, need to be encouraged directly with economic assistance to buy more British-made buses Could he ensure in future all bus orders go through British companies therefore supporting British jobs and British investment Mr Smith said the government is making any potential Wrightbus bidders aware of what support could be available, adding: This is a commercial process.Its been managed by an administrator and many of the actions are required to take place at a devolved level.But we will continue, and I do continue, to speak actively to all stakeholders in this issue and I am conducting meetings in the course of this week.

If we allow these jobs to be lost then this community and indeed the wider region faces the prospect of post-industrial declinewe succeed in saving these jobs and this production, then the road is open to an economic renaissance.“Wrightbus workers hold the key to growth in their hands. Their skills and expertise are vital for the future public transport needs of Northern Ireland and further afield. The renewable energy powered buses that this company were developing will become the new normal – the demand for these buses will drive investment and job creation above anything we have witnessed to date. Northern Ireland cannot simply sit back and watch as this historic opportunity is lost.“We are urging the wider Ballymena community to join our march and rally for jobs and a future – we need to keep on the pressure to secure a win for all”, Mr Brash concluded.

He was the le and soul of anywhere he walked into.“He was full of confidence, a real lovely lad. He did a bit of MMA fighting too – he was like a big gladiator and all the lads would have looked up to him. He was obviously able to mask his problems –only he knew how much everybody loved him.”He continued: “This night is a tribute to Caomhin, but it will also help his family out and let them know that the community cares.“It’s also about raising awareness. When people have mental health problems or suicidal thoughts there is not enough being done for them. There’s still a lot stigma surrounding it. They feel that there’s nobody to talk to or that it makes them weak. People need to know they can reach out.”Sean Dobbin, Manager at The Rock Bar, said: “Caoimhin’s death was a massive shock toeverybody. He would have been the type of doorman who would’ve been part of the craic.

It comes after a major backlash from other Northern Ireland parties, as well as the Irish Government, to proposals that would see Stormont vote every four years on whether to stay aligned with the EUs single market rules. The current set-up of the Assembly, which hasnt sat in over two years, would allow the DUP to control the decision. But Mr Barclay said: \"The key issue is the principle of consent, thats why the backstop was rejected three times, that was the concern in terms of both sides in Northern Ireland not approving of the backstop.\"So the key is the principle of consent, now of course in the mechanism, as part of the intensive negotiations we could look at that and discuss that.\"The comments open up a potential line of discussion for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who could meet later this week. Mr Varadkar is expected to hold talks with the PM amid reports that other EU leaders including Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are refusing to meet him. The French President did speak with Mr Johnson by telephone last night but Downing Street suggested afterwards that they made little progress. Mr Johnson told his counterpart that the EU should not be lured into the mistaken belief that Brexit will be delayed beyond October . Downing Street warned Brussels it would be an \"historic misunderstanding\" to believe the so-called Benn Act could prevent a no-deal Brexit, despite being designed to do so.If a deal is not reached by October  then Mr Johnson is legally required to seek an extension. A Cabinet minister said yesterday that the Government has \"no plan\" for what might happenParliament blocks the UK leaving the EU at the end of the month.Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said delivering Brexit on October  was the \"sole focus\" of ministers, who he said would do \"absolutely everything in our power\" to meet the deadline. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to meet the leaders of other Opposition parties early this week to decide on their next steps towards avoiding a no-deal Brexit. \"Its already clear that Johnsons proposal would slash food safety and standards, exposing us to, among other things, chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef, currently banned under EU standards. Thats what a Trump Deal Brexit would mean in practice,\" said Mr Corbyn.\"And on environmental protections, Johnsons proposals would mean the UK ditching the highest standards on things like air pollution or chemical safety,\" he added. Meanwhile, suggestions that the UK could try to disrupt the workings of the EUthey were forced into an extension have been rejected by MEPs. Conservative MP Steve Baker even suggested that the Brexit Partys Nigel Farage could be nominated as the UKs Commissioner. \"I think we should appoint somebody with about  years experience... we should appoint somebody whos incredibly well-known throughout the institutions, somebody who can be absolutely relied upon at all times to support our exit from the European Union,\" he said.Fine Gael MEP Frances Fitzgerald said there was no chance Mr Farage would survive the necessary appointment process. Like nominees from all other  member states, he would be subject to an assessment hearing in the European Parliament. \"We havent seen anything yetwe see Farage before a parliament hearing. It would certainly be a circus, which is not what we need,\" Ms Fitzgerald said.

AUTOCROP h bpanews_c-bde-de-bfe-bdacf_EmailThe dairy industry in Northern Ireland could be “wiped out” by a no-deal Brexit, a representative body has warned.In a stark forecast, Dairy Council Northern Irelandsaid producers and farmers face a “certain doomsday scenario”the UK leaves on October  without a negotiated agreement.The council said the industry was staring at a crisis of “epic proportions”.The body represents major milk processors in the region, including Dale Farm, Glanbia Cheese, Glanbia Ireland and Lakeland Dairies, four companies that account for over % of the . billion litres of milk collected from Northern Ireland farms each year.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Dairy Council NI CEO Dr Mike Johnston highlighted that % of milk collected at Northern Ireland farms is processed in facilities across the border Dr Mike Johnston, chief executive of Dairy Council NI, said the future of , farm families in the region was on the line.“Put simply, dairy processors and their farmers will not survive unless there is a deal,” he said.Dr Johnston said the council had estimated that trade tarfs on both raw milk and finished products moved from Northern Ireland to the EU would cost in the region of £ million a year, a burden he said would equate to a p per litre drop in the price paid to farmers.He highlighted that % of milk collected at Northern Ireland farms is processed in facilities across the border.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The council said a no deal could result in a £ million tarf bill for the industry Dr Johnston expressed concern about the administrative burden of obtaining certication to transport the milk south.He said there was not the capacity to process hundreds of millions of extra litres of milk within Northern Ireland.“Based on Dairy Council NI calculations in a no-deal Brexit, trade tarfs on both raw milk and finished products moved from NI to the EU would total £ million, before you calculate the cost of the administrative burden customs will place on dairy processors,” he said.“This tarf represents % of the value of our entire industry. “In a sector where the margin is, at best, % or %, trade tarfs of that magnitude would wipe out the industry.“The reality is stark for farmers. “Our analysis suggests that the milk price paid to farmers would fall by over  pence per litre from its current base should such tarfs be imposed.”On the milk processing capacity issue, Dr Johnston added: “The dairy industry in Northern Ireland simply does not have the capacity to process all the milk produced on farms at present and we are seriously exposed.“After maximising NI milk processing capacity, there is a processing shortfall of some  million litres that will not have a viable homepoliticians cannot find a solution to the current Brexit impasse.“That would be a devastating situation for the Northern Ireland dairy industry, farming families, rural communities and the Northern Ireland economy.“If we don’t get a Brexit deal and cannot transport raw milk south, without signicant delays and or certication requirements, then our industry is facing a crisis of epic proportions. “All processing sites in Northern Ireland will be full while there is no spare capacity to process that volume of milk in Great Britain.“We have communicated these signicant risks in the event of a no-deal to authorities in NI, the Republic and London but have not got any satisfactory outcome so far.”Put simply, dairy processors and their farmers will not survive unless there is a dealDr Mike Johnston, chief executive Dairy Council NIDr Johnston added: “Farmers and processors are extremely worried about the outcome of a no-deal Brexit.“We are now less than  days away from Brexit and we are still faced with more questions than answers and more uncertainty than certainty. “Our farmers, their families, our customers and the entire rural economy of Northern Ireland need greater security and clarity.“If we crash out on October , we do not have the capacity to process all the milk that will be produced, and we will not be able to afford to pay EU tarfs nor navigate the EU certication requirements such that we can process that milk in the Republic of Ireland.“Put simply, dairy processors and their farmers will not survive unless there is a deal. “NI farmers, processors and customers need a deal to mitigate trade tarfs and enable the continued movement and trade in raw milk and finished products.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38568793.ece/13a07/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Traffic1.jpg","title":"5000

Its lead to the cancellation of planned games because they couldnt organise a full team, according to the Irish News.Just two games were played during the  season after the end of   recruitment in  has seen a decline in nationalist recruits.The club made history after Rule , which prohibited security force members from joining the GAA, was lted in November  when the changeover from RUC to PSNI was made. Read MoreGAA players free to join policeA serving officer who has been a long-standing member of the PSNI GAC told the paper the club provided a \"safe haven and home to many gaels unable to continue playing with their own clubs for ious reasons, not least security\".\"Like any GAA club, it has given its members lelong friendships and memories,\" he said.The officer, who cannot be identied for security reasons, said at its peak the football team had  players - \"most of whom had previously played at a reasonable club level\".He said the attempted murder of Catholic officer Peadar Heffron in January , who was the then-captain of the team, and the murder of Ronan Kerr, who was from a GAA family, the next year, hit the team hard. It led them to consider closing PSNI GAC, which fields both football and hurling teams, due to fears for players lives. \"At that time, each member of the club had to decide whether they wished to continue their association, identying themselves as Irish Catholic police officers,\" he said.\"Defiantly, when the time came for the next football training a few months later we had a massive turn out, not matched before or since.\"We have played twice on the hallowed turf of Croke Park and competed against our colleagues An Garda Síochána, London politan and NYPD every two years in an international police tournament whilst also playing local club teams in counties Antrim and Down.\"Devastatingly, there has been a slow decline in the clubs fortunes in recent years.\"Since the end of   recruitment the football team has had little to no new blood. Our most recent signings have been open minded colleagues from non-GAA backgrounds willing to give the sport a go.\"They have been brilliant for us and it must be said, very talented footballers.\"With no police officers coming from a GAA background or willing to try the sport, our team has grown old. The average age of the team is now mid to late thirties with a core of players that have been together for the last decade.\"We struggle to get games at the best of times as clubs have reservations about playing us and also have their own season fixtures to contend with.\"This is the first year in memory that we have had to cancel organised games because we cannot field a team, let alone a squad.\"The officer also criticised what he described as \"aggressive and rude\" treatment by civilian staff when attending training.\"I have literally watched a number of them approach my car smiling and friendly, only to become rude and obnoxious, treating me with suspicion as they set eyes on my GAA gear [PSNI GAA gear] as I attend for training.\"However ... you will see a number of civilian soccer teams using the facilities whilst wearing their Glasgow Rangers soccer jerseys without issue.\"Around % of PSNI officers are currently from the Catholic community, while Catholics make up around % of the population of Northern Ireland.In August, Chief Constable Simon Byrne said the PSNI was \"not yet back at the point\" where - recruitment of Protestant and Catholics was needed. The Chief Constable said he wanted to \"convince the people that hold me to account that we have tried every means possible to encourage people from both the Catholic community and also the working-class loyalist community, who I think need a stronger voice in policing\".The PSNI officer who did not wish to be named said: \"It is no exaggeration to say that at least  per cent of all new recruits placed in my district since the end of   are from a Protestant and or unionist background.\"With the lack of Catholic recruits presently, the number of gaels joining the PSNI is non-existent\".He said despite requests and other sports receiving financial support, players due to travel to New York this year for the Police Games have funded the trip themselves to the tune of £, each, which is subsidised by a small amount of sponsorship from GAA supporting businesses.\"All of these ongoing issues will bring an end to the PSNI GAA club,\" the officer said.A police spokesman said: \"PSNI officers are encouraged to join the GAA club, as well as other sports clubs, within the service.

In a strongly worded statement, they accused Washington of failing to abide by its commitments to its key allies.There was no immediate confirmation from the White House of US troops clearing positions in areas in northern Syria.However, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said American troops have started pulling back, and a video posted by a Kurdish news agency showed a convoy of American armoured vehicles apparently heading away from the border area of Tal Abyad.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A line of US military vehicles travel down a main road in north east Syria Mr Erdogan spoke hours after the White House said US forces in north-eastern Syria will move aside and clear the way for an expected Turkish assault – raising concerns about the fate of Kurdish fighters who fought alongside American forces in the years-long battle to defeat IS.“Following our conversation last night , the withdrawal has started as expressed by the president,” the Turkish leader said.Mr Erdogan did not elaborate on the planned Turkish incursion but said Turkey was determined to halt what it perceives as threats from the Syrian Kurdish fighters.The White House, in a statement that was silent on the fate of Kurds, said US troops “will not support or be involved in the operation” and “will no longer be in the immediate area” in northern Syria.There are about , American troops in northern Syria, and a senior US official said they will pull back from the area – and potentially depart the country entirely, should widespread fighting break out between Turkish and Kurdish forces.The White House statement on Sunday also said Turkey will take custody of foreign fighters captured in the US-led campaign against IS who have been held by the Kurdish forces.The Kurds have custody of thousands of captured IS militants. They include about , highly dangerous foreign fighters from Europe and where – their native countries have been reluctant to take them back – and about , captured fighters from Syria and Iraq.Kurdish officials have expressed concerns of a possible breakout by IS prisoners in case of fighting in the area.Asked about the White House comments, Mr Erdogan said that both Turkey and the US were working separately to see “what steps can be taken” so that foreign fighters in prison can be repatriated.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  US President Donald Trump with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “This is being worked on,” he said.Mr Erdogan has threatened for months to launch the military operation across the border. He views the Syria Kurdish forces as terrorists and a threat to his country as Ankara has struggled with a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey.In the US, Republicans and Democrats have warned that allowing the Turkish attack could lead to a massacre of the Kurds and send a troubling message to American allies across the globe.The Syrian Democratic Forces, as the Kurdish-led force is known, said the American pullout began first from areas along the Syria-Turkey border. The Syrian Kurdish Hawar news agency and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said American troops were evacuating positions near the towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad on Monday.“The American forces did not abide by their commitments and withdrew their forces along the border with Turkey,” the SDF said in its statement. “The Turkish military operation in northern and eastern Syria will have a huge negative effect on our war against” IS, it added.SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali tweeted that his group is not expecting the US to protect north-eastern Syria. “But people here are owed an explanation regarding the security mechanism deal and destruction of fortications,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Turkish armoured vehicles conduct a joint ground patrol with American forces in the so-called ‘safe zone’ on the Syrian side of the border with Turkey In an agreement between Ankara and Washington, joint US and Turkish aerial and ground patrols had started in a security zone that covers more than  kilometresalong the Turkey-Syria border between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. The SDF had removed fortication from the areas, considered a threat by Turkey, and withdrawn with heavy weapons.But Turkey and the US have disagreed over the depth of the zone, with Ankara seeking to also have its troops monitor a stretch of territory between  and  kilometres deep .Mr Erdogan has continued to threaten an attack.The Kurdish-led fighters have been the main US-backed force in Syria in the fight against IS and in March, the group captured the last sliver of land held by the extremists, marking the end of the so-called caliphate that was declared by IS’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in .“We will not hesitate for a moment in defending our people” against Turkish troops, the Syrian Kurdish force said, adding that it has lost , fighters in the war against IS in Syria.It said IS sleeper cells are already plotting to break free some , militants detained by Syrian Kurdish fighters in north-eastern Syria.The Kurdish fighters also control the al-Hol camp, home to more than , people, including at least , foreigners, mostly wives and children of IS fighters."},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"foyleside student night set biggest best yet","story":" Magician Joel Mawhinney who will be performing mindblowing tricks to students on Foylesides Student NightThere will also be music from Q Radio, giveaways from Red Bull and VIP passes provided by Derry’s top student bars on the night to get students ready for some post-shopping drinks.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTo keep the students refreshed throughout their shopping spree there will be popcorn, slush drinks, a pick ‘n’ mix cart and doughnut walls – there really is something for everyone!Fergal Rafferty, Centre Manager of Foyleside, said: “For this year’s student night, we wanted to introduce entertaining and collaborative activities to get the students excited and encouraged to make great memories with their new peers – as well as grab a few bargains!

Coleman and Gerard Hughes exchanged scores in the aftermath of McManusrsquo red card before Nicholson gave Ballycran a - to - lead after  minutes. Two OrsquoPrey frees levelled matters in the st minute, but the drama was still unfolding.A Martin goal in the st minute put Ballycran into a - to - lead and a point from Phelim Savage increased the lead to four points just before the break.To make matters even worse for Portaferry, they had OrsquoPrey sent off after picking up a second yellow card.Ballycran now had the bit between their teeth and scores after the break from Scott Nicholsonand Phelim and Liam Savage had the McKenna Park side almost out of sight.Martin and Woods increased Ballycranrsquos lead to nine points before Portaferry hit back with scores from Colemanand Conor Mageean to leave the score at - to - with  minutes remaining.Another Coleman point left five in it, but Ballycran simply pulled away and claimed the SHC title for the th time.Ballycranrsquos Mick Branf, who managed the side with Gary Savage, was more than pleased with the way his charges went about the job.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable. This team has never put back-to-back championships and then all you have from everyone is that they are one-hit wonders, theyrsquoll get a championship this year, but sure next year itrsquoll not happen, he said.ldquoThey havenrsquot the heart for it, but they showed the heart they have.

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is. I was pleased to see friendships developing during the course and a sense of achievement in the creation of the booklet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey mdash who opened the conference mdashpraised the impact the PEACE IV project has had on the community.He said that exploring the legacy of the rebellion and the development of the United Irishmen provided participants with an insight into the heritage of their areas and into the very important topic of challenging preconceptions about history, in particular, the areas of shared and contested history.Cllr Casey said the event also provided participants with a chance to work together ldquoacross the community to discover their own stories and those of neighbouring and dferent communities.Further projects on Crime and Punishment in County Down and lsquoPreserving or Plundering rsquo: Museum Collecting from Hans Sloane to Modern Museumsrsquo will take place next year.

He felt that the delay had caused great inconvenience to a great number of people, who were expected to be moved.CROSSGAR mdash For the third successive year Crossgar soprano Rosemary McKibben has won a major inidual award at the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.Following her lsquoBest Female Singerrsquo award in , Rosemany retained the Frank Ryan Cup for the lsquoBest Irish Singerrsquo which she won last year.The Belfast Operatic Companyrsquos lsquoMikadorsquo, in which she appeared, took third place at the st anniversary festival.Rosemary also figured prominently in the quartet which was awarded the Wallace Memorial Trophy for the lsquobest concerted itemrsquo and the company lted two other major awards to make its trip to Waterford well worthwhile.Rosemaryrsquos next major engagement is in the demanding role of Donna Elviva in Mozartrsquos Don Giovanni which is to be presented by the Studio Opera Group in Belfast later this month. This opera will also be presented in Down High School, Downpatrick.DUNDRUM mdash Local councillor Mr Jarlath Carey is to meet local planners soon in an attempt to save a major housing project in Dundrum.Mr Carey will be accompanied by Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue, and Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill, who all condemned a refusal by planners this week to allow the project to go ahead.The project is to develop a -acre site to provide about  new private homes and it has been turned down because it is too big.The planners say the proposed development would be out of scale and character with the existing village and would be prominent in the villagersquos landscape.The have also said the site is outside the area considered suitable for future development in Dundrum.A planning spokesman told local councillors at a meeting on Monday that the bulk of new development of this type should be directed at district towns such as Downpatrick rather that to smaller towns like Dundrum.Mr Carey called on councillors to support a plea to planners to reconsider their decision and said he didnrsquot support the philosophy that larger development projects should go to larger towns.TANNAGHMORE mdash A landmark in the Tannaghmore district for the past century was thoughtlessly destroyed this week mdash not by vandals but by DoE workmen.The landmark took the form of a holly tree, which was shaped like an igloo, and had a seat cut inside it, but it was destroyed when workmen carried out hedge trimming operations in the area.The tree, referred to as the lsquoCourting Treersquo or lsquoCourting Denrsquo by generations, had been maintained for many years by Eddie Kelly. He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon. He was found searching drawers in the h ouse by the elderly resident, who is under doctorrsquos care, but he identied himself as a doctor.However, when he left, the man discovered around pound was missing. He contacted police, who believed the intruder was a lsquobogus doctorrsquo.BALLYKINLAR mdash A new training establishment has been set up at Ballykinlar to increase the skills of the Ulster Defence Regiment.This new instructional base will be used by full time and part time members of the UDR who will be taught to counter the increased sophistication of terrorist activity.The camp is staffed by instructors from the UDR, Regular Army units in the province and others from the School of Infantry at Warminster, and will be assisted by the RUC. To date  UDR recruits have completed a four-week course at the camp.HORSE RACING mdash More than  entries have been received for the Ulster Cesarewich meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse on Saturday.The card produces another bumper programme, following on the heels of the successful August Bank meeting, and the entries have been split over six dferent races.The meeting again has had to depend on sponsorship, as the Downpatrick course continues to do what isnrsquot done anywhere  in the racing world mdash carry on racing without government support.Major William Brownlow, in his annual report recently, said that he was confident that racing would continue at Downpatrick mdash the second oldest course in Ireland mdash for at least another few years.

Dominicrsquos practice in Newcastle, to offer the opportunity to have a standard will written for free.A limited number of free will appointments are being made available will be offered on a first

2019 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa resident’s delight after ‘nightmare’ over sewer issue resolved  ","story":"A CRUCIAL meeting has taken place to establish the scale of work required at a private housing development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station. The extent and nature of this work will largely dictate the timeframe going forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd October 2019 Speeders.jpg","title":"Speeders ‘to face pupils in school trial’  ","story":"DRIVERS caught speeding past local primary schools could soon find themselves in front of pupils who will decide their punishment at a kidsrsquo court.As part of a radical new initiative being proposed by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, drivers caught speeding outside a school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special court where the judges are children.Motorists who do not want to participate in the initiative will have to pay a speeding fine and accept penalty points on their driving licences.The idea of kidsrsquo courts started in England and now is being trialled in Northern Ireland. After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10423619.jpg","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

They must know that there are real-world consequences from dangerous language.I have many friends who took a respectful and dferent view from me on Brexit. Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

traffic calming at Ardress crossroads.The DUP MLA welcomed additional signage and awareness works at the notorious junction.Crash after crash has beenhighlighted by the MLA and he has echoed the warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor this issue and continue to raise their concerns going forward.” PSNI probe ‘serious’ assaults which left victims hospitalisedThieves ransack woman’ home while she was out on volunteer community work

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"around  jobs lost as wrightbus enters administration","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Around , jobs have been lost after Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus entered administration. The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.
