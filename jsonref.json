The cruise ship ran aground and overturned off Isola del Giglio, Tuscany, in January 2012, killing 32 people.But, even though a £23million ($30million) deal with Royal Boskalis Westminster was announced, the ship was refloated and towed to be scrapped in Genoa in July 2014 instead.             The ship is powered by four main engines driving two controllable pitch propellers (CPP) and, situated to the side of the deck, The Vanguard has a bridge, lifeboat area and living quarters capable of housing a crew of 40         The vessel was designed by Dutch holding company Dockwise who were previously famed for being the brains behind the Blue Marlin, another semi-submersible heavy lift ship, which is now the third largest of its kind"},{"url":null,"title":"Brit posts pictures raw chicken 1 300 TUI four star Menorca hotel","story":"Share this article TUI responded to Mr Collins, writing: \u0027Hi James, I am sorry to hear of your disappointment, please ensure you notify a rep or speak with our 247 holiday line.\u0027Mr Collins, who is part of a group of 11, responded: \u0027We have another week here and would rather you just put us on the next flight home if you can\u0027t change us to a competent hotel.\u0027 Speaking today, Mr Collins said: \u0027We asked to move to another hotel and were told this would come at an extra cost of £1,130 to move us all.\u0027We said we would like to fly home and were told to pay for our own flights and make our way to the airport but we don\u0027t have a mass of money because we have been eating out as a result of the raw food.\u0027                He added: \u0027The rooms are full of mould, the food has been non-existent or raw, one bar open for the whole hotel at night with queues of 25 mins and a maximum of two party sized cups, some rooms have rats, no entertainment and rude incompetent staff\u0027Other holidaymakers have since shared their experiences online.  Mina Kowalkowski responded: \u0027Four years ago I went here and the issues were the same then.

A thoroughbred horse previously bought for £240,000, with past links to a famous Irish trainer and to a stud farm owned by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, was found abandoned and nearly starved to death in a Cork barn.War Celeste, now a seven-year-old mare, was bred from a United States-based stallion called War Front, who commands a current stud fee of $250,000 (€222,500).Last year, the horse was found abandoned alongside 10 others, in a farm barn. The thoroughbred horse was emaciated, with its ribcage showing, and in such poor condition euthanising the animal was considered.Four of the horses, including War Celeste, were discovered locked into stable pens. In one stable horses were found standing on a mound of excrement several feet high. The other seven horses were found by an animal welfare charity elsewhere on the farm, left without access to hay or adequate water.At least three of the 11 horses had to be euthanised due to the condition they were recovered in. Two dogs in poor condition and a number of cats were also found at the farm.War Celeste has since been nursed back to health by My Lovely Horse Rescue, whose volunteers initially discovered the abandoned animals.Horse-racing clubThe horse was originally bought for £240,000 in 2013 by a horse-racing club, China Horse Club. Preparation for the auction sale was done by a Watership Down stud farm, which is owned by musical composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.After the sale the horse was moved to Ireland to be trained as a racehorse. At one point it was trained by famous Co Tipperary trainer David Wachman, who retired in 2016. However, the horse never raced, and was later sold as a brood mare, which is a horse used for breeding, in 2015.This was the last registered sale of the horse at auction, bought from the horse racing club for £15,000 by a bloodstock agent. It is unclear how the horse later came to reside on the Co Cork farm.Maddie Doyle, a volunteer with My Lovely Horse Rescue, said the charity regularly deals with cases of animals found in bad condition. “This case is probably one of the worst we’ve ever witnessed,” she said.The horses locked in stables “hadn’t seen daylight in a long time”, and had been without care for “at least weeks and weeks”, she said. The animals were emaciated, with overgrown feet, and later difficulties moving due to their confinement, Ms Doyle said.People were “uncomfortable” talking about cases where thoroughbred horses were abandoned, due to the significance of the horse-racing industry, she said.China Horse Club was set up by Teo Ah Khing, a wealthy architect, entrepreneur and racehorse enthusiast. A spokesman for the club said the animal was sold in “great condition” in 2015, and it was “disheartening” to learn of its abandonment.Gardaí in Cork are investigating the abandonment of the animals, and a Garda spokesman said officers were pursuing a “definite line of inquiry.”Gardaí are investigating a single suspect who had previously run the farm but is since believed to have left the country, one local Garda source said.Department of Agriculture veterinary inspectors seized the horses shortly after they were discovered, and several have been rehomed with rescue charities."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3890667.1557753019!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"widow of paraglider seeks to return 500 voucher he found","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDominika and Rafal SkóraThe widow of a taxi driver who died in a paragliding incident on Saturday says she wants to ensure a wedding voucher left in his car is returned to its owners.Rafal “Ralph” Skóra (41), a paragliding enthusiast originally from Poland but living in Artane in north Dublin, went out of his way to make contact with the owners of the gift voucher mislaid in his taxi on Friday night and was looking forward to handing it over.However, the following day, the experienced glider took off from Black Hill above Blessington Lakes and was last seen heading south over the Wicklow Mountains and Glenmalure. The alarm was raised by his wife Dominika on Saturday night when he failed to return home.Mr Skóra’s body was found at 8am on Sunday by a group of fellow paragliders and adventure sports enthusiasts, who were working with the Wicklow Mountain Rescue and the Irish Coast Guard.Prior to the fatal trip, the father of three had on Friday evening picked up a male passenger at Merrion Row in Dublin.He dropped the man at a Spar shop in Monkstown, some 9 kilometres away. Afterwards, Mr Skóra found a gift voucher belonging to the passenger in his car. He made contact with the man and his future spouse.“He was very happy to find them and before he left the house on Saturday morning. He said that because he did something good and found them, karma will get back to him with something good as well,” Mrs Skóra said.“He was sure he would have a lovely day and fly 100 kilometres.”Mrs Skóra said the voucher was still in her possession and appealed for the engaged couple to make contact so she can return it to them.“The voucher is still at home and I would love to get it to them. Rafal really wanted them to have it back because finding them made him so happy,” she said.“I have no contact details for the couple so I would be so grateful if they got in touch with me. It was Rafal’s wish to return the voucher to them and I want that to happen.”Mrs Skóra said she realises the couple may not want to impose on her due to the accident, but added: “Please get in touch — Rafal would have wanted them to be happy.“He was the best husband I could pray for and amazing father. That’s all what matters. I will never forget him. I’ll hope to see him in my dreams,” she said.Mrs Skóra said he would be missed by his 21-year-old son Jakub who lives in Poland.“I will make sure that my children with Rafal, Benjamin who is three-years-old and 12-weeks-old Julianna, will know everything there is to about their father.”On Friday night Mr Skóra had asked for help in trying to trace his passenger, who is due to be married on May 24th.“Picked customer up at Merrion Row and dropped off at Spar in Monkstown. All I know is that . . . he is going to marry . . . in two weeks’ time. I would love to get it back to him. Please share. Thanks.”Many people tried to help Mr Skóra to find the man, with 22,000 people sharing his post. Many praised the taxi driver for being so “kind, caring and honest”.One commented on Friday night: “You’re truly remarkable so well done”. Another added: “Fair play. Great to see some honest people still out there. Well done to you.”Following Mr Skóra’s death, the Dublin Taxi Drivers organisation paid tribute: “Rest in peace to the most honest taxi driver,” it said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3885416.1557342181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"deal giving reciprocal rights for british irish citizens is signed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan, Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Britain’s minister for the cabinet office David Lidington, and  secretary of state for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley during a press conference in London at the signing of the Common Travel Area deal. Photograph: ReutersHenry NichollsThe British and Irish governments have signed an agreement that formally outlines the provisions of the Common Travel Area (CTA) for the first time and guarantees the reciprocal rights it confers regardless of Brexit. Tánaiste Simon Coveney and cabinet office minister David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy, signed the agreement in London on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council (BIIGC).“Our message to Irish citizens in the UK is that your rights will not change. You will still be able to move freely between Ireland, the UK and the islands.“You will still be able to work, study, draw your pension and access social security and public services in the UK. Above all, you will be welcome. And we welcome the similar commitment the Government of Ireland makes to British citizens in Ireland,” Mr Lidington said.Mr Coveney said the agreement should reassure British citizens in Ireland and Irish citizens in Britain that, regardless of whether Britain leaves with or without a deal, their rights and privileges would be protected. “This Memorandum of Understanding is comprehensive but it’s also flexible enough to be able to be updated and changed in the future if necessary and will be backed up with legislation in the necessary areas,” he said. Mr Lidington and Mr Coveney were joined by Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan and Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley for the two-hour BIIGC meeting. Established under the 1998 Belfast Agreement, the BIIGC did not meet from 2007 until last July but met again last November.Wednesday’s meeting focused on the future of the east-west relationship, economic cooperation, security issues in Northern Ireland and legacy issues as well as the Stormont talks.“The theme running through this is how we can strengthen our bilateral cooperation on everything from economic regeneration to security and justice. We obviously very much welcomed the resumption this week of talks aimed at restoring the Executive at Stormont,” Mr Lidington said. The memorandum of understanding sets out an agreed policy framework for the CTA, which not only guarantees free movement of people between Britain and Ireland but covers access to social security, health and education. The two governments have agreed to maintain existing arrangements on social insurance, child benefit and pensions. They have also agreed to work on new arrangements to ensure that British and Irish citizens will continue to have equal access to public health and education services in both countries.Newcastle University’s Colin Murray, a legal academic in the research project NI Constitution who campaigned for the CTA to be codified, said the agreement had been largely settled for months. “It is being concluded now because there is a period of relatively low tension in the Brexit negotiations, because the Irish and UK governments being seen to work together supports the drive towards a deal on restoring power-sharing institutions within Northern Ireland, and because, from the Irish Government’s perspective, Theresa May might not be long in office, and the CTA therefore needs to be locked down,” he told The .Business groups welcomed the agreement and John McGrane, director general of the British-Irish Chamber, said the free movement of people between Britain and Ireland brought tangible economic benefits.“The CTA helps support the €70 billion annual trade between our countries. It has resulted in there being more Irish Directors of UK companies than any other foreign nationality and it has contributed to Irish companies being the fifth largest foreign owners of UK firms,” he said.“Today’s agreement will go some way to protecting these achievements. However, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce remains clear in its view that the best way of protecting the economic and social links between these islands is through an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU followed by an unprecedented close future relationship. We encourage public representatives on all sides to work together to make this happen.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3890403.1557744022!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"greens and labour may claw their way back in upcoming local elections poll data shows","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCllr Duncan Smith (left) Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin and Cllr Dermot Lacey during the launch of The Labour Party’s manifesto for the local elections in Buswells Hotel, Dublin.

Both parties suffered massive losses in Dublin after the financial crisis but Monday’s data shows they may, through local candidates, be clawing their way back. Labour has grown to 14 per cent support in Dublin, while the Greens are at 10 per cent — both representing significant gains since March when voters were asked their voting intentions in the general election. The Social Democrats, who hope for a breakthrough local elections, are at just 2 per cent in Dublin, the same as Independents for Change. SolidarityPeople Before Profit are at 4 per cent. The regional breakdowns of a national poll are derived from a smaller sample size (the national sample size was 1,500 in this poll) and therefore carries a larger margin of error. They should be seen as indicative, rather than absolute numbers. However, they are useful as likely evidence of broad trends among voters. The poll was taken in the middle of last week. Elsewhere, Fine Gael has a strong lead in the rest of Leinster in the local elections with 32 per cent of the first preference vote, followed by Fianna Fáil on 23 per cent, Sinn Féin on 17 per cent, Labour on 6 per cent and the Green Party on 3 per cent. The Social Democrats are on 1 per cent in Munster, Fianna Fáil leads the local elections race with 34 per cent, while Fine Gael is on 28 per cent. Support for Labour is at 3 per cent, while the Greens attract 4 per cent of first preference voters, according to the poll. Sinn Féin is on 12 per cent. In Connacht-Ulster, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are almost neck-and-neck, with just a point separating them — Fine Gael on 26 per cent, Fianna Fáil 25 per cent.

Photograph: Doug MillsThe New York TimesI am not going to write “a beautiful letter” to Premier Trump, the kind he likes to get from fellow autocrats. But I have to give him credit for one thing. When Trump fatigue seemed to set in after the Mueller report, with cable network ratings dropping, I had total faith that Trump and his crazy posse would find some bizarre way to grab back the spotlight. And, indeed, what could be more insane than this? A president who has spent two years battling accusations that he colluded with a foreign power to fix the 2016 election manages to wriggle off the hook. Just three weeks later, his lawyer unveils their 2020 plan: to collude with a foreign power to fix the election. “We’re not meddling in an election,” Rudy Giuliani protested to the New York Times’s Ken Vogel. “We’re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do.”Giuliani had his bags packed for a trip to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, to meet with the president-elect – who made his name playing a president on a TV comedy. Rudy wanted to stir up investigations that might buoy any one of Trump’s febrile rants about Ukrainian connections to “the dirty dossier”, the origins of the “witch hunt” and, of course, how all of it leads back to Hillary and the Democrats. And, while he was over there, Giuliani was going to try to pick up some fresh ammo to use against Hunter Biden, who served on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch, in an effort to hurt the Democratic rival he now calls “SleepyCreepy Joe”.UproarAfter an uproar, Giuliani cancelled the trip late Friday night, saying he thought he was being “set up” and that Democrats were trying to “spin” the trip. Volume I of the Mueller report garnered less attention than Volume II, but in some ways it was more chilling. The Russian spies, hackers and cyberteams who aimed to upend the 2016 election “in sweeping and systematic fashion”, as the Mueller report put it, were far more efficient and successful than the Russians who met with Donald Trump jnr in Trump Tower.Trump’s former homeland security chief, Kirstjen Nielsen, was told not to talk to the president about plans to protect America from Russian interference in the next election. He’s putting his hands over his ears on this one. He didn’t even bother to bring it up in his recent phone call with his pal Vlad. Volume I is dispiriting, both because of the spectre that the Russians are coming for us again, with our digital defenses down, and because of the sad arc it unspools about the existential perils of social media. George W Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld dragged us into the past. Still stung by rollbacks of presidential power after Watergate, Nixon acolytes Cheney and Rumsfeld had pushed for extreme executive privilege and for America to be a swaggering hyperpower in the world. They mired us in two interminable wars in Flintstones territory when we should have been looking ahead.Bogged downWhen Barack Obama was elected, it felt like we were moving to a bold, gleaming future with a young, appealing president who would reposition America to deal with Asia, AI, globalisation and all the fresh challenges of the 21st century. But Obama’s presidency was bogged down by W’s epic mistakes and his own professorial aloofness. The fears and ire of Americans who felt displaced and left behind intensified and metastasized across social media. We learned the dark side of the fiendish little devices that were supposed to make our lives brighter, and the avaricious side of the lords of the cloud, who turned out to have world domination dreams that rivalled Cheney’s.Silicon Valley’s touted utopia helped deliver our current dystopia. “Collectively,” the Mueller report said, the social media accounts of the Russian troll farms and bots, pretending to be American activists, “reached tens of millions of US persons.” Boosted by all the phony content on social media during the campaign, and by his own adeptness using Twitter as a sabre, Donald Trump got into the White House and began yanking us back to the ‘50s – on abortion, on climate change, on women’s rights, on regulations. Most devastatingly, he’s turning back the clock with the judiciary. Trump always seems like someone who walked out of a Vegas steam bath in 1959. And now the whole country is starting to smell of moth balls. When the Vatican complains that you’re dragging the US “back to the past”, you know you’re in trouble. Besides Mark Zuckerberg, Trump is the most successful exploiter of social media in history – and he’s 72.FrighteningChris Hughes is not the perfect messenger. He stumbled into a fortune based on a lucky roommate situation and then used it to trash the venerable New Republic magazine and help bungle a swing district for the Democrats. But the co-founder of Facebook is correct that Zuckerberg’s unbridled power is frightening it’s a story straight out of Mary Shelley. “Mark may never have a boss, but he needs to have some check on his power,” Hughes wrote in a searing New York Times oped piece. “The American government needs to do two things: break up Facebook’s monopoly and regulate the company to make it more accountable to the American people.” It’s time for all our social-media-addicted dictators – in the DC swamp and in Silicon Valley – to have their wings clipped.\u0026nbsp– New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

I\u0027m 62 nearly now and I thought, well, retire.He then joked: I didn\u0027t want to be forced to retire.Wearing an orange shirt and a fez, the broadcaster went on to say his show would ironically be about the times his career ... had hit a brick wall.He said: Topically, here we are again. That\u0027s the last time I\u0027m going to mention it.That\u0027s the whole point of tonight. It\u0027s the most unlikely tower, and I\u0027m stuck in it.It should never have happened.Continuing to speak about the issue, the 61-year-old said: I genuinely didn\u0027t know what the atmosphere would be like tonight.But equally, if anyone does want to rush the stage, I\u0027m a Millwall fan with a snooker cue.You wouldn\u0027t believe how I was feeling 20 minutes ago but I\u0027m so pleased so let\u0027s do this.He added: When life deals you lemons, you chuck them at people calling you a racist.Opening the second half of the show, Baker said: I\u0027ve never been a sentimental sort. But I\u0027m numb with gratitude tonight, I caught my wife in the break and you reduced her to a pile of tears.At the end, he said: I do want to say this and I\u0027m not milking it but it\u0027s been one of the best nights of my career tonight.

After a 15 minute surgery, the vast majority of patients will regain their sight.However barriers to treatment are significant. In many corners of the globe, the £28 operation represents a small fortune – if it is offered at all in local hospitals.  The coordinated approach to community health (Catch) programme, part-funded by the UK’s Department of International Development (DFID), has sought to close treatment gaps by tapping into existing networks established to eradicate trachoma.“Avoidable blindness could triple by 2050 unless efforts to improve eye health-care are stepped up across the world,” Moses Chege, Sightsavers project director for Catch, told The .Disease of thorns | The battle to eliminate trachoma“Catch used innovative ways of improving this eye health-care, by piggybacking on trachoma camps to identify and treat people with other conditions,” he added.The fight against the so-called “disease of thorns” – which turns eyelashes against the globe of the eye and slowly blinds – has been ongoing for decades. Trachoma screening camps established by organisations such as Sightsavers across East Africa, where the disease was endemic, have had considerable success.But thousands of those who went in search of help did not receive treatment, as the trachoma camps were not equipped to tackle the eye conditions they were suffering from.The £5 million Catch programme, funded through the UK government’s aid match scheme, has addressed these gaps in eye care.Between 2014 and 2018, more than 64,600 cases of bacterial conjunctivitis were treated and 28,400 pairs of glasses were provided within the camps.Gladys Atto with patient Loumo Mariam, after performing sight-saving surgeryA further 21,000 people with cataracts who had surgery, having been provided with transport to their nearest hospital facility.“My life has totally changed,” said Loumo Mariam, who had cataract operation last year. “I can now move, look for water, for food. They will say I was half dead, but now I have risen back to life.”In her 60s, Loumo is from a small village in north-west Uganda. After a diagnosis at a trachoma camp in her village she was taken to hospital, completing the hours-long journey with 16 other patients.Her surgery was completed by Gladys Atto, a new ophthalmologist. It costs in the region of £20,000 to train a specialist eye doctor, and Dr Atto is one of 30 funded by Catch.Gladys Atto performing a cataract operation at at Moroto Regional Referral Hospital, North UgandaSome 650 existing health workers also received additional training in eye care - skills desperately required.The 30-year-old can perform as many as 30 cataract operations each day.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleBut as targets to eliminate trachoma are neared and the screening camps no longer required, the Catch project will have to adapt again. Sightsavers say the lessons learned will play a major part in further improving eye care in some of the world’s most remote communities.“It has also strengthened health systems so that this important work can continue,” he added.Sightsavers are currently raising funds for the \u0027End is in Sight\u0027 appeal.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBreaking through the $6,000 barrier was a moment of truth for bitcoin... it holds a major psychological significance for the community, said Simon Peters, a cryptocurrency expert\u0026nbspat the online trading platform eToro.We could see prices reach levels last seen at the start of 2019, potentially hitting the $12,000 to $14,000 range by the end of the year.Other major cryptocurrencies have been significantly boosted by bitcoin\u0027s turnaround in fortunes, including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin.\u0026nbspThe combined market capitalisations of the top four alternative cryptocurrencies have risen by nearly $10 billion since the start of May.The cryptocurrency market\u0027s remarkable recovery comes despite traditional markets seeing a relative slowdown in growth since the start of the year.Given that global markets are having a bit of a wobble at the minute, bitcoin\u0027s price growth in recent weeks means it is one ot the strongest asset classes so far in 2019, Mr Peters said.Other experts have suggested similar positive movement in the months ahead, with financial adviser Nigel Green saying in April that the so-called crypto winter has come to an end.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Andy Martin meets one of the brains behind the projectClick to followThe IndependentStark raised thousands of pounds for his firm through public initiatives and private donationsAs a schoolboy, Adam Stark was torn between being a musician and a computer scientist. So while he was supposed to be studying IT at Queen Mary University\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspLondon, he was mainly moonlighting on bass guitar and keyboards in a band called Munro Fox. But he also did a bit of producing and engineering on the side. By the time he graduated and embarked on a PhD, there had been a convergence between his academic work and his “first love”. The subject of his dissertation was Musicians and Machines: Bridging the Semantic Gap in Live Performance.“It made perfect sense,” he says when we meet in the cafe at the British Library in London. “I had been studying the mathematical relation of the harmonic series. The problem was how to make machines more sensitive.” Stark is 36 now, managing director of MI.MU\u0026nbsp(pronounced Me-Mew), and has come up with the most musically sensitive glove in the history of the world.Music is now, inescapably, music tech. Computers are an integral part of music production. “But,” says Stark, “they are still stupid: they don’t understand changes in tempo.” His dream is to get a computer tapping its foot in time to the music. “Why can’t I play a G chord and the computer chimes in with me?” The idea of “machine musicianship” is not to turn musicians into clunky robots but to free them up and allow them to play with more soul and spontaneity.The MI.MU\u0026nbspglove may be the closest we have yet come to synchronising musician and machine. “I love going to gigs,” says Stark. “But when you see live performances of electronic music, it often looks as if they’re sending their emails.” A guy behind a box pressing buttons or twiddling knobs is never going to be as visceral or exciting as a drummer or a guitarist. The glove enables you to become a one-hand band. “It gives the electronic performer the same expressive power that acoustic musicians have.”We’ve always used our hands to communicate. With the advent of the glove, body language is now body music. But (a word of warning) you have to be a decent musician to start with. It’s not going to magically turn a clumsy wannabe into a virtuoso overnight.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Samsung will cancel orders of its Galaxy Fold phone at the end of May if the phone is not then ready for sale.

Then he saw a tweet from Imogen Heap seeking technical expertise for a project she had been working on. She wanted to do a live performance in her garden using a glove. “She needed something serious and professional, not a toy.” The seed had been planted by an opera singer who had used a glove, engineered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u0026nbspMedia\u0026nbspLab, to produce more vibrato. Gloves had also been used to control machinery. “But we had to start again from scratch,” says Stark. “They weren’t up to spec.”Stark pays tribute to all the people involved in the project. As well as musicians and techies (including Tom Mitchell of the University of the West of England in Bristol), they needed a textile specialist (Hannah Wilson) to make the gloves work and a designer (Rachel Freire) to bring style and flair and make them look and feel good. The summer of 2012 saw Imogen Heap performing a song, with the gloves, in a geodesic dome powered by the pedalling of massed cyclists in her back garden in Essex.Imogen Heap presents the glove to a summit in Lisbon last year (Getty)But that was just the start. They had made something wonderful: an item of clothing that controlled music wearable tech, but fitted, bespoke, to just one inidual artist. It was hugely over-designed and expensive. The point was to make one that worked potentially for anyone. That’s when MI.MU\u0026nbspwas born with a mission to “enable people to express themselves through tech”. The name means Me-Music, ie you are personalising the music you play, shaping it – with the movements of your own body – to give form to your mood and thoughts and personality.At the beginning, you needed a backpack, loaded with technical kit, wired to the gloves, and a team of people standing in the wings to make it work. Now, after years of research and development, the glove really is just a very streamlined, sinuous-looking glove, connected to a computer via bluetooth. Numerous artists, including Ariana Grande on her 2015 world tour, have road-tested them. And now they’re available to pre-order online direct from MI.MU\u0026nbspat £2,500 per pair (you can buy one at half the price).Harry Potter composer invents pair of gloves that makes musicBut what impressed me was Stark’s ability to drum up funding to keep the whole show on the road for years before the product could go on sale. Inidual musicians who believed in the concept chipped in thousands of pounds. But Stark was also able to win a number of grants, from Innovate UK (funded by the government) and an EU source, Horizon 2020. The company still had to finesse the sensors that were capable of recognising postures and measuring the bend of a finger or the orientation of a wrist. Are you clenching your fist? Pinching your fingers? The glove needs to know.Wearing these gloves is cool in a\u0026nbspway that holding a white stick\u0026nbspis notThe gloves are made of 60 per cent\u0026nbsprecycled fabric. MI.MU\u0026nbspuses\u0026nbspCarvico vita, a high performance sports fabric, and Yulex, a sustainable, plant-based alternative to neoprene. And they are produced in Leicester by Sew Systems, who helped them develop fabric bonding in place of stitching.The glove can be used by dancers and actors as well as musicians:\u0026nbsp“They’ve got the movement, now we can do the sound.” But Stark reckons that\u0026nbsp“gesture-based” tech\u0026nbsphas other potential uses. He foresees MI.MU-gloved surgeons carrying out remote operations in far-flung parts of the world via Skype. Meanwhile, he is still heading up a long-running musical project called Rumour Cubes\u0026nbspand there is talk of his old band, Munro Fox, reforming. At least they won’t need a huge vehicle to lug all their kit around. All they have to do is snap their fingers.View from the TopQueen Mary University of LondonOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not ready to return home to Washington DC\u0026nbspyet, the couple scoured Airbnb\u0026nbspfor holiday\u0026nbsprentals and found a cabin in the mountains of West Virginia in a town called Lost River. Neither of them had heard of the place before, but they instantly fell in love with its wild, forested landscape – and the solitude.“It didn’t feel like any place I’d been to before,” says\u0026nbspJonas, who grew up backpacking with her family near their home in northern California. “All the other places where I’d vacationed around here were full of people.” When her wife, Laurie, suggested buying property there, Jonas, an entrepreneur, wondered if there might be a business opportunity.Now, two years later, Jonas and two friends, Shawn Harrington and Andrew St\u0026nbspCyr, have launched Lost River Vacations, an eco-friendly tiny house retreat on a 22-acre property in Lost River. Two and a half hours away from the district, the retreat is scheduled to open in June.The three friends are all small businesses owners in the DC\u0026nbsparea, but what makes their story unique is not that they’re starting a trendy new venture – it’s that their trendy new venture is owned, managed, and supported almost exclusively by the deaf community. Jonas, Harrington, and St\u0026nbspCyr, who met as students at Gallaudet University, are deaf the tiny house itself was built by deaf carpenters a deaf-owned company, Catalyst+, will design hiking trails on the property and the walls of the tiny house will be decorated with artwork by deaf artists.That’s part of the purpose of Lost River Vacations – to support the deaf economy.“Deaf people and deaf businesses have been marginalised for a long time,” Harrington says\u0026nbspRed Bear Brewing Co, where Lost River Vacations launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to expand the retreat. “If you take a deaf business and a hearing business, people typically choose the hearing business,” Harrington says. By encouraging everyone to visit their retreat, the trio hopes that hearing people, who might otherwise be reluctant to hire deaf businesses and iniduals, will see the value deaf people can add to a project and be inspired to work with them.They\u0026nbspwill open with one tiny house that sleeps four available to rent. But the trio hopes to raise enough capital to build 10\u0026nbspmore small abodes, including a tree house and a yurt, in the years ahead. This past week, they raised enough money to build a second house that they hope will be up and running later this summer.The retreat, previously a hunting ground, is 2\u0026nbspmiles away from Lost River State Park. It lies outside the range of mobile-phone\u0026nbspservice and sits at an elevation of 1,850ft\u0026nbspwith views of mountains and forests – and no signs of other human inhabitants. (Urban travellers need not fear: “High-speed wifi,” the retreat’s website reads, “makes it easy to post your best pictures to Instagram!”)Google Doodle honours Charles-Michel de l’Épée, ‘father of deaf’More than 500 deaf people gathered for the fundraiser at Red Bear Brewing Co\u0026nbspover craft beers, sausages and free cake to support Lost River Vacations. All across the room, people in the crowd – which included government workers, small business owners, and students – were signing to one another while the deaf DJ, Nico DiMarco, blared songs like “No Scrubs” and “All the Single Ladies” loudly enough so that the audience could “feel” the beats and vibrations of the music. (DiMarco’s brother, Nyle, also deaf, was the 2015 winner of the reality show America’s Top Model.)It was no accident that the event was full of creative talent, says\u0026nbspCalvin Young, a filmmaker who created the marketing video for Lost River Vacations, as he interacted with the crowd at the brewery.“We have something called ‘deaf gain’,” says\u0026nbspYoung, explaining that when one sense like hearing is missing, that amplifies the others, like taste and sight\u0026nbsp– meaning that in the deaf community, there are a disproportionate number of cooks, artists\u0026nbspand designers. “Hearing people might focus on sound,” Young says, “but when I’m filming, I’ll focus on movement or the facial expression. There is no sound in my videos. I want people to see my film as I see them, through deaf eyes.”Rosemary Latin, the baker of the free cake, was sitting along a wall watching the party unfold. A pastry chef, she founded Rosemary’s Fabulous Cakes in Keedysville, Maryland in 2003. Many of her clients are deaf, but she also has a roster of hearing clients, some of whom didn’t realise she was deaf when they first approached her. “When they found out,” Latin says, “they were a little resistant at first.” They worried about how they’d communicate and work together. But Latin reassured them. She told them that they could communicate via texting rather than calling. “I had to be a bit more assertive,” she says.Entrepreneurs like Latin, Young\u0026nbspand Jonas and her partners are bucking trends in the deaf community. According to an analysis by the National Deaf Centre, which used data from the US\u0026nbspCensus’s 2014 American Community Survey, the employment rate among the deaf is 48 per cent compared to 72 per cent in the hearing community, and nearly half of all deaf people are not in the labour force compared to a quarter of hearing people.“The deaf community is starving for entrepreneurs,” says\u0026nbspRyan Maliszewski at Red Bear.Cyr, Jane Jonas\u0026nbspand Shawn Harrington\u0026nbspduring the\u0026nbspfundraiser at Red Bear Brewing Co\u0026nbspin Washington\u0026nbspDCMaliszewski directs the Gallaudet Innovation and\u0026nbspEntrepreneurship Institute, which launched in the autumn\u0026nbspof 2017. Most students at Gallaudet, he says, major in communication studies, interpretation\u0026nbspor social work, and go on to work in deaf-related roles, such as teachers in deaf schools. Though that’s fine, he also wants the students to not be afraid to think big. Being deaf, Maliszewski points out, equips students with a set of characteristics that makes them natural entrepreneurs – like assertiveness and the ability to quickly adapt and be resourceful.“Our community has some absolutely phenomenal talents, but they do not communicate using sound, so they are unknown,” Jonas says, “so it’s my passion to get their work and talents out there.”The other, major goal of Lost River Vacations is to expose more hearing people to the deaf community.of deaf people are unemployed, according to analysis by the National Deaf CentreThe retreat will welcome deaf and hearing people alike, and the three co-founders hope that hearing people who come will leave with a different perspective on deaf iniduals. Right now, Harrington explains, many hearing people see deafness as a disability, a term that implies victimhood and helplessness. They don’t understand how deaf people can function in a culture as auditory as ours. “Once when I was at a restaurant,” Harrington says, “a stranger gave me a $20 bill saying ‘I’m so sorry you’re deaf.’ But it’s like, no, I can pay for my own food! But they learn you’re deaf and they think everything is falling apart, that there’s something wrong with you.”It’s similar with parents, he explains. More than\u0026nbsp90 per cent of deaf children are born to hearing parents, and many of these parents believe the only way for their children to succeed is by learning to speak. There is a major schism in the deaf community between people who embrace sign language\u0026nbspas their primary method of communication and those who want themselves or their children to assimilate into hearing culture with cochlear implants and speech therapy.NHS to offer hundreds more deaf people life-changing implantBritish Sign Language GCSE may be introduced after deaf boy’s campaign‘Deaf students far less likely to attend prestigious UK universities’Growing up, Jonas sat in the middle of that schism. She was raised by hearing parents in Berkeley, California. Her mother, a high-school foreign language teacher, understood the critical importance of language to the development of a young child and so learned to sign with Jonas. But Jonas’s parents also sent her to thousands of hours of speech therapy classes. Eventually, they enrolled her in deaf schools. Jonas thrived academically and when the time came to choose a college, she decided to attend Gallaudet. She considered going to a more mainstream school like UC Santa Cruz, where she’d been accepted, but Jonas realised she didn’t want to spend the next four years of her life speaking and learning through an interpreter. She wanted to “figure out how to be a deaf person in the world,” she says.Jonas, Harrington, and St\u0026nbspCyr want to show deaf children, their parents\u0026nbspand the hearing community that it’s possible to be productive and successful while embracing one’s deaf identity.Seeing Lost River Vacations launch, Maliszewski says, gave him goosebumps. “I want students to hear more of these stories,” he says, “and say, ‘Oh, if they can do it, I can do it, too.’”Audiology and DeafnessOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It could table a takeover bid after which it would be free to appoint whomever it wanted to run the thing and implement its strategy.Of course, that would involve the outfit buying out all the other shareholders at a premium and\u0026nbspCoast\u0026nbspdoesn’t want to do that, hence all the noise\u0026nbsp(this sort of thing is great fun for those of us in the media).\u0026nbspDirectors are, of course, charged with acting in the interests of all shareholders. But don’t kid yourself. Coast\u0026nbspCapital’s attempt to get it\u0027s nominees on to\u0026nbspthe board is about getting control on the cheap, and then getting out quick with a nice return when the show\u0027s over.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

This morning the bank sought to stop the rot\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent Bank has sought to reassure investors and customers that all is well with the institution“Meet the new bankers, same as the old bankers.”That was The Independent’s headline at the top of a piece I wrote back in 2016, having delved into the backgrounds of the bosses of the challenger banks the government hoped would shake up Britain’s moribund banking industry. More than half of them were linked through having worked for Fred Goodwin’s Royal Bank of Scotland, which ended up nearly breaking the UK economy.\u0026nbspGiven the rash of negative stories about  Bank (its boss Craig Donaldson is one of the RBS alumni who were featured in that story), would that headline today read\u0026nbsp“meet the new banks, same as the old banks”?\u0026nbsp Bank reassures customers’ their money safe after WhatsApp rumour Bank should not let recent failures alter its course Bank and Starling get millions from RBS competition fundThere was even, over the weekend, an incidence of people queuing to withdraw cash in west London, which brought back uncomfortable memories of a certain Northern Rock.\u0026nbspFor goodness sake, calm down, said the bank this morning, in response to some of the wild rumours flying around social media. We’re not even close to being in the sort of situation the Rock was in. Yes, we’re raising £350m from our investors, but it’s to finance growth, not to bail us out and it’s going well. We’ll complete before the end of June. So move along, there really is nothing to see here.\u0026nbspThe trouble for  is that it created a rod for its own back when it had to admit that it had messed up with the risk classification of some of its loans for regulatory purposes – a big no no – and reported some disappointing results at the start of the year.\u0026nbspThe shares behaved as if they’d taken a right to the nose from Canelo\u0026nbspAlvarez. They’ve been rolling around on the floor ever since. Shorting the stock has been a favoured tactic of hedge fund managers with their eyes on new yachts. In the space of not much more than a year, a stock that had reached the giddy heights of £35 has fallen back to just over £5. It was on the slide again this morning.\u0026nbspThe world outside London’s financial centre has taken note of this. It has only added fuel to the brush fires that Donaldson and his team are now trying to put out.\u0026nbspThey’ve pointed to the awards  has been winning for customer service, the fact that it’s opening branches when others are closing them, the profits it has declared.Your money is safe, and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme covers you up to £85,000 anyway, has been the message.\u0026nbspProblem is, bitter past experience tells people there’s no smoke without fire and logic says that if they’re worried it’s safer to get out. Even though depositor protection has markedly improved since the Rock hit the rocks, getting compensation takes time and causes inconvenience and worry.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Details of the fundraising are expected to be revealed this week.The new funds are to cover an\u0026nbspaccounting error that saw the bank underestimate the amount of cash it needed to hold to cover the risk some of its loans.Despite the assurances  Bank’s share price dropped as much as 9 per cent on Monday before recovering to trade 5 per cent down. Bank should not let recent failures alter its courseIn an interview with the Financial Times, chief executive Craig Donaldson revealed that  Bank is looking at selling\u0026nbsp£1bn worth of loans at the centre of the problems.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said: “Having hundreds of customers queue up to withdraw money certainly hasn’t helped matters, particularly as the business is in the process of trying to raise £350m to alleviate concerns about its balance sheet.“Chatter on social media that customers’ money wasn’t safe spiralled out of control at the weekend, with memories of the run on Northern Rock in 2007 still in many people’s minds.”Pre-tax profits slumped to £6.9m in the first quarter from £10m a year ago, while shareholders have also been urged to vote against the re-election of chairman Vernon Hill.Mr Hill has come under fire for the accounting blunder and for millions of pounds of company money paid to his wife’s architecture firm InterArchMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “It is highly probable that shareholders will insist on some management changes as a quid pro quo for any new capital, with chairman Vernon Hill, as well as chief executive Craig Donaldson, in the firing line of some investors, on the back of a share price e from £35 12 months ago to under £5 now.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Details of the fundraising are expected to be revealed this week.The new funds are to cover an\u0026nbspaccounting error that saw the bank underestimate the amount of cash it needed to hold to cover the risk some of its loans.Despite the assurances  Bank’s share price dropped as much as 9 per cent on Monday before recovering to trade 5 per cent down. Bank should not let recent failures alter its courseIn an interview with the Financial Times, chief executive Craig Donaldson revealed that  Bank is looking at selling\u0026nbsp£1bn worth of loans at the centre of the problems.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said: “Having hundreds of customers queue up to withdraw money certainly hasn’t helped matters, particularly as the business is in the process of trying to raise £350m to alleviate concerns about its balance sheet.“Chatter on social media that customers’ money wasn’t safe spiralled out of control at the weekend, with memories of the run on Northern Rock in 2007 still in many people’s minds.”Pre-tax profits slumped to £6.9m in the first quarter from £10m a year ago, while shareholders have also been urged to vote against the re-election of chairman Vernon Hill.Mr Hill has come under fire for the accounting blunder and for millions of pounds of company money paid to his wife’s architecture firm InterArchMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “It is highly probable that shareholders will insist on some management changes as a quid pro quo for any new capital, with chairman Vernon Hill, as well as chief executive Craig Donaldson, in the firing line of some investors, on the back of a share price e from £35 12 months ago to under £5 now.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The extra light came about because the galaxies were releasing blazing amounts of ionising radiation.That discovery could help shed light on what is called the Epoch of\u0026nbspReionization, the mysterious moment at which the universe\u0027s first lights started switching on, and which led to the starry sky we see at night.The new study looked at some of the universe\u0027s first ever galaxies, which formed less than a billion years after the big bang or more than 13 bilion years ago.It found that in some wavelengths of infrared light, the light coming from the stars were much brighter than had been expected. The study was the first time that scientists had seen the phenomenon in a big sample of different galaxies – showing that the brightness was coming not from a few galaxies but that the average galaxies were much brighter than those we see today.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

But the existing evidence suggests the first lights started to switch on about 100 or 200 million years after the big bang, when the hydrogen gas that was floating around the universe gradually started to push itself into stars.Universe expanding faster than expected, Nasa data confirmsAfter about a billion years, the universe was dazzling with the bright lights we see today. And the universe had changed fundamentally: the neutral hydrogen gas that had been floating around had disappeared, with the universe switching from being full of neutrogen hydrogen to being filled with ionised hydrogen.That process is known as the\u0026nbspEpoch of\u0026nbspReionization and is key to the nature of the universe as we see it now. And while scientists understand what happened and how it changed the universe, they do not know how the universe was filled with enough radiation to switch over an entire universe, and what prompted it.It\u0027s one of the biggest open questions in observational cosmology,\u0026nbspStephane De Barros, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Geneva in Switzerland said in a statement. We know it happened, but what caused it? These new findings could be a big clue.To try and answer that question, researchers looked back in time, peering through the universe to see the moment just before the Epoch of Reionization came to an end. The Spitzer telescope looked at two specific parts of the sky for 200 hours, letting it see light that began its journey more than 13 billion years ago, coming from the very beginnings of the universe.In that data, the astronomers were able to find 135 distant galaxies, and spotted particular brightness in two specific wavelengths where light is produced during the process of ionizing radiation colliding with\u0026nbsphydrogen and oxygen. It suggests those early galaxies had huge young stars made up of\u0026nbsphydrogen and helium.Those are not the universe\u0027s first stars, but they among the oldest. As such, they offer a hint at how the universe evolved during the time they were born.We did not expect that Spitzer, with a mirror no larger than a Hula-Hoop, would be capable of seeing galaxies so close to the dawn of time, said Michael Werner, Spitzer\u0027s project scientist at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. But nature is full of surprises, and the unexpected brightness of these early galaxies, together with Spitzer\u0027s superb performance, puts them within range of our small but powerful observatory.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However he\u0026nbspwill not be equipped with the same heavy radio equipment or a gun.The event, described as a “Jump for Freedom”\u0026nbspon his fundraising webpage, has already raised more than £7,000 for the Salvation Army and its work to fight human trafficking and modern slavery.“Parachute jumps are dependent upon reasonable weather but all being well I will be jumping again on June\u0026nbsp5th\u0026nbsp- almost to the hour since my jump into Normandy 75 years ago,” he said.Mr Read, who was awarded France’s highest honour, the Légion d’Honneur, in 2016, said he\u0026nbspis looking forward to the challenge despite his age.“Yesterday is not our best, our best is tomorrow,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ordinary voters will receive a less crude version, simply entitled\u0026nbsp”Stop Brexit”.The party also supports a Final Say vote with Remain as an option, as well as freedom of movement.\u0026nbspThe Greens put a second referendum at the heart of their document,\u0026nbsp”Right Now. For the Future”, promising to mobilise\u0026nbsp”a positive, pro-European movement to win”.Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP\u0026nbspmakes the case for Scotland to stay as part of the EU, rather than “being dragged out against its will”.On the other side of the ide, the Brexit Party is arguing for a no-deal exit, which it calls a WTO (World Trade Organisation) departure.It wants its MEPs to be part of the negotiations and says it will refuse to pay the UK’s £39bn orce bill.Ukip wants an “unconditional Brexit” and vows its MEPs will vote against all EU legislation if they take their seats.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately it hasn\u0027t been respected and we have a Remain parliament, therefore parliament has not been able to deliver on Brexit in the way it should have been delivered upon, she said.We have a prime minister\u0026nbspfrankly who doesn\u0027t have the vision for the United Kingdom post Brexit that we all want to see. We want to see a United Kingdom that is strong post-Brexit and has a close relationship with Europe.Nigel Evans - an executive member of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs - has said his party are going to get an absolute hammering in the European Union elections.\u0026nbspEven the opinion polls for the next general election are woeful for the Conservative Party, he told The Emma Barnett Show on BBC Radio 5 Live.They\u0027re the worst I\u0027ve seen in my political history and I\u0027ve been a member of the party for 44 years.The fact is, what are we going to say? Please vote for our MEPs who we hope won\u0027t be able to take their seats because we will have done a deal? That\u0027s basically the message.On the cross-party Brexit talks between Labour and the Conservatives, he added: These talks that are resuming today between the Labour Party and the Conservatives are nothing more than a cosmetic exercise, which was displayed by Tom Watson this morning, he said.How can we possibly talk to a Labour Party that has its deputy leader of that party saying now they wish to remain and reform the European Union?On the cross-party talks, a spokesperson for the prime minister has just been quizzed by journalists, but made it clear there has been no change in the current position. Let\u0027s see where we get to this evening, the spokesman said - referring to the resumption of talks today at 5pm in Whitehall.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAsked whether Theresa May was playing for time, he added that the PM had tried all other avenues and that she is trying\u0026nbspdeterminedly to find a way through.\u0026nbspPressed on whether firms should be stockpiling for the possibility of a no-deal outcome in October - the new Brexit deadline - the PM\u0027s spokesman would not be drawn, but said it was a matter of legal fact that a deal Brexit was still the default route, without a deal in place.Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has arrived at the EU\u0027s foreign affairs council and has given a brief clip to cameras.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAsked about the cross-party negotiations with Labour aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock, he said: We are talking to the Labour leadership, and we have had very, very detailed discussions.People have been pessimistic right from the outset that these discussions weren\u0027t going to go anywhere, but they have actually continued.So we have to see what happens this week. This is a crunch week.On the possibility of a second referendum on Brexit, Mr Hunt added:\u0026nbspFrom a Conservative point of view, we\u0027ve always said that we think that would be a betrayal of what people voted for, and we want to implement the first referendum.But let\u0027s see where these talks go to.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s insane. ‘I don’t know, I haven’t spoken to her?’ That’s ridiculous. Pathetic, pathetic,” he says.The comments are in contrast to the EU’s diplomatic public approach to talks, throughout which they heaped praise on their counterparts such as Ms May and David Davis.On another occasion captured in the documentary, Edel Rettman-Crosse, Mr Verhofstadt’s top aide, describes the UK’s then Brexit secretary Mr Davis, who the team has just met with, as having his “head in the f***ing clouds”.The officials agreed that Mr Davis\u0026nbspdid not “really give a f**k” about the Irish border, one of the key issues\u0026nbspthat bogged down Brexit talks for months afterwards.“David Davis explained to us that Ireland is not a problem,” says an exasperated Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin, recounting the meeting. The Brexit deal has since been blocked by the UK parliament effectively over the Irish border question.Ms May’s conference speech also goes down poorly with the team, with Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin shouting “Oh, f**k\u0026nbspoff!” at the screen when the prime minister\u0026nbspclaims she is working hard to get a deal.The film also gives the impression of a Brussels that feels totally unthreatened by the UK, with regular mocking doled out at the UK’s expense.Over breakfast in one scene, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Barnier end up discussing classic cars, and Mr Barnier jokes: “That’s what they’re trying to do with Brexit, take an old car and restore it.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentElmar Brok, a German ally of Angela Merkel who sits on the Brexit steering group, says the EU should not help the UK sort out its “mess”.\u0026nbsp“I am very clear we have to do nothing. We are ready and they have to come,” he advises. “And we have to wait while the air becomes thinner and thinner because we lose time.”On another occasion, officials are also bemused at Ms May’s invocation of “war spirit” in her conference speech.After one encounter in which Mr Verhofstadt has an argument with Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Rosindell,\u0026nbsptop aide Ms\u0026nbspRettman-Crosse tells her boss: “I’m most proud of you when you take on a Tory. He was a f***er.”The documentary is likely to be seized on by second referendum campaigners and opposition politicians as evidence of the UK’s incompetence in talks. It is also likely to anger Brexiteers, many of whom see Brussels as trying to punish the UK.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We must declare a climate emergency nowThe committee recommended scrapping\u0026nbspthe outdated\u0026nbspemissions target, which aimed to slash damaging greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent of what they were in 1990.To reach net zero by 2050,\u0026nbspmillions of people will have to switch to low-carbon heating, eat less meat, fly less and\u0026nbspdispose of waste more efficiently.Necessary overall investment could run to\u0026nbsptens of billions each year, or 1 to 2 per cent of GDP, the report said.Energy\u0026nbspsecretary Greg Clark\u0026nbsphailed the report as a “comprehensive and groundbreaking” document, and vowed to respond “in a timeframe which reflects the urgency of the issue”.But the government\u0026nbspfaces increased pressure to act, after MPs\u0026nbspoverwhelmingly\u0026nbspbacked Commons bid\u0026nbspby Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspto declare\u0026nbspa “climate emergency”.The new survey, conducted between 7 and 10 May, found\u0026nbspthe public was unimpressed by the\u0026nbspgovernment’s record on climate change.Nearly half (46 per cent) either did not know or had no view on its performance, while 30 per cent disapproved of its actions.Only 23 per cent of respondents gave\u0026nbspa positive response when asked about the\u0026nbspgovernment’s record.Created with Sketch.Extinction Rebellion: Climate change protests cause chaos in London Show all 46Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester gives a thumbs up as he stalls a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in London246 City of LondonProtesters hold up traffic on Upper Thames Street in the City of LondonProtesters hold a banner as they hold up a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in LondonOfficers remove plants that were placed in the occupation of Waterloo BridgePolice officers arrive at Oxford Circus as they prepare to remove protesters during the fifth day of a coordinated protest by the Extinction Rebellion group, April 19An activist waters the plants at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeUndeterred by over 400 arrests, climate change activists continued their demonstration into a fifth day in London with a small protest at the country\u0027s main Heathrow Airport, along with the ongoing protest camps at other iconic locations around the British capitalProtesters with the words \u0027glued on\u0027 written on their hands hold hands as police officers arrive at Oxford CircusOfficers circle the lorry that serves as the central stage to the Waterloo Bridge occupation, repeating their tactic from a earlier at the Oxford Circus occupationOxford Circus reopens after being closed for days due to occupationOfficers prepare to move in on the occupation of Waterloo BridgeActivists relax on a sofa at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeBritish actress Emma Thompson talks to members of the media from atop the pink boat after police officers surrounded the boat being used as a stage as climate change activists occupy the road junction at Oxford Circus  in central London during the fifth day of environmental protesst by the Extinction Rebellion groupAn Extinction Rebellion demonstrator is carried away by police on Waterloo BridgeActivists on Waterloo Bridge have made a garden for their occupation site, April 20Demonstrators began blocking off a bridge and major central road junctions on April 15 at the start of a civil disobedience campaign calling for governments to declare an ecological emergency over climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt bioersity loss and be led by new citizens\u0027 assemblies on climate and ecological justiceEmma Thompson joins the Extinction Rebellion protest at Oxford Circus.

It seems that love is going to win.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of the action group Extinction Rebellion hold banners in front of the Eiffel Tower after spilling fake blood on the Trocadero esplanade during a demonstration to alert on the state of decline of bioersity, in Paris.

Roads are for everybody. Every house has been electrified. National security is for everybody.” \u0026nbspThe past five years had been “very good”, she said. “A lot of work has been done, the country is progressing. We are happy.”Sunita Rajput, 42, the wife of a police officer, said her family had\u0026nbspalways voted BJP. “People do say Congress is good, but for me it is important that we have a person who can kill the terrorists. He did that, so I am voting for Modi.”She credited\u0026nbspMr Modi with “helping stop corruption” through demonetisation, a 2016 policy which overnight devalued the most common Rs1,000 notes, supposedly in order to deny organised criminals great hoards of “black money” and make it all liable for taxation.\u0026nbspEconomists say the drastic action dented the country’s GDP growth and hit small and medium businesses particularly hard.Narendra Modi celebrates Diwali with militaryA report by the Reserve Bank of India said 99.3 per cent of the notes were legitimately returned to the banking system, suggesting the attempt to wipe out “black money” had failed.Ms Rajput insisted\u0026nbspthe move was “for the good of the country”, however – “even if we did have to stand in line for two days to get our notes exchanged”.It’s a very different story across the city in Old Delhi, home to the city’s largest historic Muslim community. The parliamentary constituency for the area, Chandni Chowk, also voted BJP in 2014, albeit with a smaller margin of victory.Muhammad Abed, 38, a Muslim e-rickshaw driver, said\u0026nbsphe was voting for Congress.Gandhis face stern reelection test as India goes to polls“He craves a fight between Hindus and Muslims, talking about temples versus mosques, emphasising the differences between the two communities. The level of hatred is very high now, relations are very strained, and this has only happened in the last five years. We used to go and drink water in each other’s houses, now we don’t.”Though he fervently supports Congress, Mr Abed admitted\u0026nbspthe vote in Chandni Chowk\u0026nbspwas “mixed”.Muhammad Kamran Hussain, another rickshaw driver and also 38, said he would vote for AAP.\u0026nbsp“This is a very poor neighbourhood, and there are a lot of people doing business on the streets. He has killed those businesses. Modi claims it is in the name of ‘cleaning up India’, but he doesn’t look out for the poor. He only looks after the wealthy.”\u0026nbspHe said\u0026nbspthat while he thought\u0026nbspthe BJP would “not get any votes” in the neighbourhood around Jama Masjid, the opposition was split – between Congress and AAP. It’s a split which might have been avoided if alliance talks had not broken down in recent weeks, and which could be enough to see the BJP succeed across Delhi once again.Speaking outside a polling station right in the heart of Old Delhi, among spice stalls and jewellery shops unusually shuttered for the holiday that is election day here, elderly men and women from a generation that had\u0026nbspalways voted Congress struggled to muster much enthusiasm for the party’s current leader, Mr Gandhi.Asked who should be the next prime minister, 67-year-old Mahesh Nagar said: “Anyone except Modi.“This is a fight between two ideologies. It is between a Congress that says ‘we, the people of India’. And what does the BJP say? ‘Only Hindu’. India is a place for all religions, not for just one.”Madama Sachdeva, 79, said India was in a state of “unannounced emergency”. “People are terrified, but they cannot speak of it. Our freedom of speech has been lost. \u0026nbsp“The middle class and the small people are unhappy due to price increases, but nobody seems to care about it. They say our country is progressing – but progressing on the shoulders of whom?”Asked if he thought\u0026nbspCongress had\u0026nbspa chance of beating the BJP when results are announced on 23 May, he said: “That is up to almighty God.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And, of course, she was with the prince by her daughter’s side when she gave birth.Normally the Queen is the first person to know of a new royal arrival, but this time Doria pipped her to the post.It is the first time a photo has shown the non-royal grandparent watching the Queen meet a new member of “The Firm” for the first time. And in another break with tradition, Doria was given a special mention when Buckingham Palace officially announced the baby’s birth on Monday.This suggests Doria, , will have a big role to play in Archie’s le and as a rock-like presence for Meghan.The Queen, like her grandson Harry, has a special affinity with Africa, both having spent extended periods on the continent during their twenties. She will likely appreciate the important role maternal grandmothers play in families with African heritage.Doria is an African-American grandmother who has raised a young woman of mixed heritage to be confident, strong and independent in the US, a country still coming to terms with its complicated racial history.The fact that Archie has such a erse family, from free-spirited yoga teacher Doria, right through to the Queen, will help him navigate the path in front of him. The baby ushered in an offshoot of our Royal Family that represents modern Britain where people of mixed race or dual heritage are the fastest-growing ethnic group.Archie bridges three continents: Europe, America and Africa, and the ability to help dferent groups of people find common ground will be really important in our future.By embracing change and adapting to the modern age, our Royal Family continues to occupy a place in the nation’s hearts.Archie will grow to be a young man familiar with the challenges we face in learning to live with dference, and he will be raised by people — such as Doria — who have done this successfully. In an interview, Doria’s stepmother, retired teacher Ava Burrows, said: “I’d assume she is going to be a hands-on grandmother. Historically in our culture, the mother worked long hours and needed support with her kids.“Grandmas usually live close together with the rest of the family, playing a big part raising their grandkids.“Doria is very important to Meghan. She’ll be a wonderful grandmother.”Doria was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in September . When she was a baby, her father Alvin, an antiques dealer, uprooted the family to Calornia. Soon after they settled in LA, Doria’s parents orced.Her father married Ava. He died after he tripped and hit his head on a kerb in .Doria was raised by her mother Jeanette, a shorthand typist. After leaving school Doria worked as a travel agent and later started a business selling clothes she made herself.In her early s she trained as a make-up artist and landed a job on the set of a TV soap, where she met and fell in love with Meghan’s dad Thomas, who she married.They orced when Meghan was six and Doria later worked as an air stewardess.Doria’s pet name for Meghan was “flower” and the pair shared a powerful bond.Describing her mum on her former blog The Tig, Meghan wrote: “Dreadlocks. Nose ring. Yoga instructor. Social worker. Free Spirit. Lover of potato chips and lemon tarts.“Andthe DJ cues Al Green’s soul classic Call Me, just forget it. She will swivel her hips into the sweetest little dance, swaying her head and snapping her fingers to the beat.”She also wrote about how Doria imposed strict curfews when she was a teenager, taught her to cook Cajun shrimp gumbo and took her jogging and bike-riding.Perhaps Meghan will hope her mother will repeat all these activities with Archie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they would. And there ARE Tory Remainiacs who, in their religious zeal to engineer a second chance to halt Brexit, appear ready to shred everything : their Government, their party and their own jobs.The EU, justiably emboldened, now brazenly interferes in our politics.The EU Parliament’s odious Guy Verhofstadt campaigns alongside Vince “B***ocks to Democracy” Cable of the Lib Dems. Donald Tusk tells Brussels to give us enough time for a second vote he is certain would overturn the first.They’re cocksure . . . they have done this so often where, after all. Yet they simply have no grasp of the rage among British voters — both Leavers and former Remainers are determined to uphold our democracy.That was the Government’s goal too once. Now  We’re not sure.In  days the Brexit Party can put the EU and its Westminster stooges straight.EVEN now the Tories could save themselves with a new leader.Unlike Theresa May, he or she needs to be determined to exit the EU with no dealnecessary — AND sell it to MPs.That may look the tallest of tall orders.But civil service preparations have made huge strides. The worst effects can be mitigated. Many Remainer MPs still spread panic about it, knowing only that they are meant to.The new Tory leader must back No Deal, or use the genuine threat of it to improve Mrs May’s deal with the EU.It is indeed the party’s only chance.A MEASURE of how far our once great Parliament has sunk is that Labour MP Richard Burgon may soon run the justice system.Five years ago this thick Corbynista called Zionism, the right of Jews to their homeland, “the enemy of peace”. “I am proud to say,” he crowed, “I wouldn’t be a member of ‘Labour Friends of Israel’.”Then the spotlight fell on his party’s anti-Semitism. Burgon denied saying any of it, only for footage to turn up revealing he did. But the Shadow Justice Secretary insists his denials weren’t lies. He just forgot what he’d said.So that’s OK, then.Imagine our future under Corbyn’s prejudice-fuelled mob: With Marxists casually spitting out bile, making ­denials, then excuses.And this one would run our courts.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we must try to find a balance.The royals have long-established traditions and do not like change.But given how intense le is for new parents, who can blame Meghan and Harry for wanting to enjoy it alone for a bit Most women avoid cameras for weeks after giving birth. So having a photo taken, under pressure to look gorgeous, scrutinised from every angle, just a couple of days after giving birth  That is a huge ask.I didn’t get out of my pyjamas for a week both times after I had children.Harry and Meghan did a fantastic job introducing Archie to the world.I loved how Harry carried his baby in, already the hands-on father he wants to be, alight with the joy of new fatherhood.However, it was impossible not to think about how wonderful Diana would have been as a grandmother.The birth of a son must be bittersweet for Harry, knowing Diana will never meet Archie.While some grumbled about the two-day wait to show off the baby, others recommend a “babymoon” for parents to shut out the rest of the world and bond with their baby for a week or two.Something tells me that would have been Meghan and Harry’s preference, so this was a compromise.They understand they are public figures.Archie is seventh in line to the throne and his parents know that taxpayers, who in part pay their salary, expected to meet the baby at some point.Most of us only wish to send our love, wish the new parents well and share the moment with them.Within hours of the birth, Meghan’s half-sister had suggested the new arrival meant Meghan was morally obliged to reconnect with her father, Thomas Markle.Let’s be clear. Meghan doesn’t have to do any such thing.She is better off without a father she can’t trust.If your own family are not up to scratch, you make your own based on love, trust and happiness.Given how happy Meghan and Harry look with Archie, they are doing just fine with that.A couple of things really stood out for me about the way they introduced their baby to the world.First, didn’t Meghan look amazing in her Grace Wales Bonner-designed dress I love the fact she chose white, which clearly showed her post-baby bump.She knows what a role model is.And she knows better than to create unrealistic aspirations for women who have just given birth.After all, most mothers still have the bump for at least a few weeks after having a baby.Then there was the look of sheer happiness on the Queen’s face as she looked down at her new great-grandson.Even with her many children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, she radiated a delight she shares with grandmothers up and down the land.It was just beautul to behold.MAMMA mia! Looking at the cover of Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit issue – featuring model and entrepreneur Tyra Banks – it’s impossible to believe Tyra’s first cover was  years ago and she came out of “modelling retirement” for the shoot.The very idea of wearing a yellow string bikini – at any age, let alone  – is unimaginable to most of us mere mortals.Butyou’ve got it, flaunt it . . . and Tyra certainly still has it.I AM increasingly convinced the only way to grow old gracefully is simply to accept that it’s happening.So I feel bad for Katie Price, who at  had another facelt last month in Turkey.On Wednesday’s Good Morning Britain, the ex-model discussed her “addiction” to plastic surgery.She explained how she had her own fat injected under her eyes and had the side of her face “lted” in a bid to look more youthful.It sounds horric. Choosing to have serious surgery to look a bit younger is baffling.Maybe she feels defined by her looks and will do anything to hang on to them.When I look at pictures of Katie or watch her on TV, I wish she would be kinder to herself and love herself more.She should worry more about how she feels than how she looks.She needs a best friend – someone who knows everything about her and still loves her – to tell her to stop scratching the wrong itch.Katie should give up the plastic surgery and learn to love herself the way she are . . . wrinkles and all.NOT sure I’ll be taking up Lisa Snowdon’s tip for keeping an eye on how much she eats – using chopsticks for every meal instead of a kne and fork.The TV presenter, , says they slow down her eating, so she feels full more quickly.But whatyou are having soup I HAD a chuckle about the fact that Gregg Wallace’s favoured comment on his we Anne-Marie’s Instagram account is the suggestion that she print out a photo.Someone has compiled a mega-tweet of the many times he has commented on his -year-old partner’s photos, demanding she “print it”.When it comes to social media, that sort of defeats the object.Gregg, I feel for you. It’s hard getting older – and it sucks not understanding the modern way of doing things.WHEN Donald Trump refused to publish his tax s, I assumed it was because he didn’t want people to know how much money he had.It turns out it was because he had so little.His tax s reveal he “lost more money than almost any other American taxpayer for a decade, after his hotels and casinos racked up .BILLION dollars in losses”.So not quite the billionaire he claims he is . . .  or the ace businessman.PERHAPS the most surprising news of this week is that although more alcohol is now being drunk around the world, we Brits are not responsible for the rise.We call them snowflakes but, very often, the young people I meet are much more focused and impressive than my generation ever was.APPARENTLY it’s not just booze we Brits are giving up. Thanks to technology, we are now having less SEX than ever before, too.A major study found there has been a steep decline in rates of intimacy since , with fewer than half of Britons now having sex once a week.Scientists said that “le in the digital age” was partly to blame – with couples now too distracted by Netflix, social media or their phones to focus on each other.But seriously,you prefer Netflix or your phone to sex with your partner... well, it’s time for a orce, I’d say.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They moved house a lot, making it hard for him to settle.More upheaval came when his ­parents orced when he was ten, and he began suffering crippling shyness and anxiety. He said: “Divorce is hard enough when you’re an adult — never mind when you’re a child.“That was probably when my shyness started, when I was at my shyest.”It attracted attention from bullies, but Dan was a resilient kid and always had computer games to take him away from his troubles.He said: “I kept myself to myself. Everyone experiences bullying at some point — there are always older kids who think it’s cool to pick on the younger kids. I would not say much, concentrate on work then go home.“Moving and knowing no one on the other side of the country was dficult and fuelled my shyness and anxiety.”But, as Dan now realises, his childhood trauma helped him achieve his dreams, as he turned to gaming as a distraction. He said: “I wouldn’t change ­anything. Video games were my way of escaping.”It was at high school that Dan met Jemma — who he credits with driving his YouTube career.He had just finished a degree in music production and was working at Tesco when he began receiving his first royalty cheques from YouTube.

After the third month my YouTube cheque equalled what I earned in the supermarket.“I said I’d ride it a bit longer and see how it went but Jemma said, ‘No, do it now, this is your time’. She’s a smart woman.” Dan was just  when they wed but he said: “When you know, you know. We’ll  be together for ever, easily. My we is my most important thing to me. Being single and doing this job would drive you crazy. Having someone there who can listen  to you and support   you emotionally is so important.”In November  Dan feared he would lose Jemma. She was rushed to hospital with severe stomach pain and diagnosed with appendicitis.But when the routine op went on for eight hours, he knew something was seriously wrong. He said: “They found it wasn’t her appendix at all, it was all this diseased bowel and it was Crohn’s ­disease, so it escalated.”Jemma is now managing her condition, which causes bowel inflammation, but Dan faced his darkest days as she recovered in hospital.He said: “I’m usually quite positive but I got to the point where I couldn’t do anything but cry. And there are not many days like that.”After ten years as a couple, Jemma and Dan are talking about starting a family, and Dan is grateful to have a job that keeps him at home.He said: “It’s good to know my kids will never want for anything — not just materially but also a stable household. That is when the hard work will pay off, when I can stay home with my kids.”With most of his fans aged between eight and ten, Dan is proud to be  a role model with a squeaky-clean image — which he revealed is genuine.He said: “I am like that. I don’t swear,  I don’t drink,  I don’t party, that’s just me. I’m not being someone , I have tattoos and that is it.”And even with £million, he is not tempted to be a wild child.He said: “I could afford a lot of drugs but no, that’s not the le I want to lead. I’ll never go off the rails — that’s not me.”l Tickets for DanTDM’s tour are available at dantdmtour.    ED SHEERAN – £m: Singer and songwriter, known for Shape Of You.    HARRY STYLES – £m, below: Former member of One Direction.    NIALL HORAN – £m: Also made his fortune by being in One Direction.    LITTLE MIX –       £m: Girl group      who shot to fame      on X Factor.    LOUIS TOMLINSON –  £m: Former member of One Direction.    LIAM PAYNE –  £m: Former member of One Direction.    ZAYN MALIK – £m: Former member of One Direction.    SAM SMITH– £m, above: Singer, who sang James Bond hit Writing’s On The Wall.    RITA ORA – £m: Hot Right Now singer.

They said that I’m overreacting.“They said it was a school matter and not an operational matter. The school can only do so much – she has bat ears, they can’t get them corrected for her.“Myself and Dr Frosh are just disgusted that with theof time that they’ve put her through, that I’ve had to tell her that the operation was cancelled a couple of days before.“She stopped eating. That’s how bad it got.”Cara said Lillianna was crushed by the news the surgery wouldn’t happen.The schoolgirl blamed herself for the operation not going ahead – and even worried the doctors were laughing at her.Cara enlisted the help of a Health Visitor to advise how to get Lillianna to eat again while she also stopped wanting to go round to friends’ houses or take part in PE at school.Then one day, as the battle with the hospital review board raged on, Cara got a call out of the blue from Mr Frosh, who works in One Hatfield Hospital – a private hospital in Hertfordshire.He was delighted to tell her that his team there were going to do the operation - which would normally cost around £, - completely free of charge.Cara said: “They are touched by her story.“Dr Frosh has spent time with Lillianna and seen how the effects on Lillianna have caused her problems at home and in school, and he’s just seen that she’s just a very sad little girl.“Doctors don’t normally do that.“It’s amazing.”During her pre-op assessment, Cara said Lillianna was introduced to the staff as their “VIP guest” and they “treated her like a princess”, which made her cry with happiness.Cara added: “I don’t want any other children to go this because my daughter’s thin anyway, and for her to stop eating it’s quite detrimental for her.”She’s now booked in to have the surgery in June.Speaking about the special case, Mr Frosh told Sun Online: “To give you an idea about Lillianna – she is just sweetness itself. I find it hard not to cry when she comes to see me because she’s just so lovely.“And I could tell when I saw her that she was losing her hair from the stress of it, and she’s not eating properly, and she’s not sleeping at night, and she’s wetting herself at school.“She would be very likely to improve a lot by having the surgery.“The idea with bat ear surgery is to render them unnoticeable, and that’s going to be the aim with Lillianna.“There’s a lot of evidence to show thatyou perform this operation on children that are bullied, that actually the bullying goes away.“We carry our childhood into our adult le, and who knows how much this is going to affect her in the long-term.”Because kids ears are close to adult size by the age of six, any perceived abnormality can be more noticeable.So a pinnaplasty operation is used to pin ears back to make the ears less visible.The operation invovles shaping the cartilage and skin behind the ear to look less prominent.A surgeon will cut behind the ear and take out a thin sliver of skin.Theyll also put permanent stitches under the skin when needed.The whole surgery normally lasts between one and two hours, and does not noramlly require the patient to stay in hospital overnight.A spokesperson for Bedfordshire CCG said: “Like all NHS organisations, Bedfordshire Clinical Commissioning Groupis responsible for using the available resources in the most effective way.“Whilst we cannot comment directly on inidual cases, pinnaplasty is ordinarily considered to be a cosmetic treatment and is therefore not routinely funded.“Through the inidual funding requestprocess, cases are considered on the grounds of exceptional health need on a case by case basis.” "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT0004866521011.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mum dairy allergy cant forgive teen cheese","story":"Karanbir Cheema went into anaphylactic shock when the cheese, half the size of a Post-it note, landed on his skin at his school in Greenford, West London.The teen, known as Karan, collapsed and tragically died ten days later on July , .Today, Karans mum Rina told This Morning how she was still taking one day at a time after her little boy died from the thoughtless act.Holding back tears, the mum said: Im numb.Im still devastated - its hard to forgive.An inquest into Karas death last week heard how the other student, who is now , had previously been known for throwing food at other pupils daily.Rina added: Its very hard to believe that lack of understanding, especially where he was warned not to do it in school.My son wasnt safeguarded.Karan was severely allergic to wheat, gluten, eggs and nuts and suffered from asthma and atopic eczema.But mum Rina said her son had always been responsible about his allergies, even checking food labels himself.Reliving the fateful day, she said her mothers instinct kicked in when her sons school called her to tell her that he had suffered an allergic reaction.She said: I knew something wasnt right.An inquest into Karans death last week heard how the school did not have the students allergy action plan included in his care plan or medical box.The school administered an EpiPen, used to treat anaphylaxis, but the adrenaline was out of date.Grieving Rani said she had been praying for a last minute miracle before eventually making the heart wrenching decision to have her sons le support turned off.She said today she took some comfort in seeing her son smiled as they said their last goodbyes.The mum-of-one is now urging for more education around allergies - saying people needed to understand how quickly they could turn fatal.She even suggested students be shown the drastic impact that allergies could have.The teen involved in the incident apologised during the inquest, saying: I didnt mean any harm.Im sorry - Im sorry for what I did.But the inquest found the teen had been thoughtless.Coroner Mary Hassell told St Pancras Coroners Court: This was a childish and thoughtless act, but was not calculated to cause serious harm.Karanbir died because he had an allergic reaction to cheese that was thrown at him by another pupil.While the allergies from which he suffered are relatively common, his fatal reaction to an allergen that was no ingested but was only ever in contact with his skin is extraordinarily rare.Twyford Academy Trust said: We now hold two spare EpiPens in each of our schools.The school had not been provided with an allergy action plan and we fully believe this would have strengthened the schools healthcare provision.The system we have in place for checking medication provided to the school however did not operate as it should have."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT0004894700931-e1557744299974.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"seaside four bed roof terrace newquay cornwall","story":"The property, called Island Reach, gives panoramic views of Newquay Island and the Cornish resorts Towan Beach, a popular surfing spot.Built in , the eco-house is in part of a block of seven homes considered to be the first zero carbon development in the UK.There is a designated parking space in a gated parking area at the rear of the building, which comes with its own electric car charging point.The home has four bedrooms and bathrooms spread over three floors, with a rooftop terrace perfect for taking in the beautul views of the ocean.Other perks of the more than ,sq-ft home are an outside shower and a storage cupboard for beach and sports equipment, the perfect place to park a board.It has been owned by a family who have used it as a holiday home but have now put it on the market.Martyn Rohrs, of Cornish agent Rohrs  Rowe, said: Newquay is one of Cornwall’s most highly favoured coastal locations, famous for its many beautul sandy beaches and home to probably the country’s best surfing spot, Fistral Beach.This exceptional and very spacious coastal residence offers a very rare opportunity to purchase a superbly constructed, modern house with smart home technology.This makes it easy and reasonable to run as a second or main home, as well as having many highly sustainable and eco friendly credentials.The accommodation is very spacious at over ,sq ft and offers a well balanced layout of four double bedrooms and four bathrooms, as well as flexible living spaces that are located on three dferent floors.There are great views from virtually every floor, which improve as you move up through the building, culminating with amazing panoramic views from a good-sized outside rooftop terrace."},{"url":null,"title":"youtube prankster lauren love walmart sack cashier","story":"Maria Leones broke down in tears when the content creator played the cruel joke on her at the Richmond store in Texas.The video, which has prompted a string of scathing comments, has since been deleted from the channel.Maria told ClickHouston that shes worked at the store for six years since moving to the US from the Philippines to be closer to family.She said her job is incredibly important to her family and told how her husband is recovering from a heart attack and bypass surgery.Her job is covering their medical insurance and bills, she said.Maria said that when Love told her she was fired, all she could think about was her husband.She told KTRK-TV: I felt so powerless at that time.Really, I was really so crushed.

My house is like a building site at the moment so that was the first thing that I decided to spend my winnings on.Then I decided to treat the family to a luxury holiday to Barbados.

No fudge. No more delay. Just leave.Within the Cabinet, pro-Remain ministers are said to have asked the PM to scrap talks with Labour.Instead the likes of Philip Hammond and Damian Hinds want Mrs May to hand the decision to Parliament, giving MPs a binding vote on the whole range of dferent Brexit outcomes.Last night Sir Keir, who is leading the Labour team in the Brexit talks, called for a second EU referendum.Its the first time Jeremy Corbyns negotiators have openly demanded a public vote on any compromise agreed with the Tories.The shadow minister told the : I’ve made it clear that at this stage, at this th hour, any deal that comes through from this Government ought to be subject to the lock of a confirmatory vote.He claimed Labour MPs would refuse to support the cross-party deal without a referendum tagged on.She insisted she had no choice but to negotiate with the opposition, having repeatedly failed to get enough of her own MPs on board to pass a deal.But the talks are now on the brink of collapse after deadlock over the key issues of whether to stay in the EU customs union, and whether to hold a second referendum.The Tories initially set last Wednesday as the deadline for negotiations to conclude and they are unlikely to continue beyond this week.Assuming the talks do break down for good, Mrs May has pledged to hold a fresh round of Commons votes on all the possible Brexit outcomes.Unlike the previous indicative votes, the motions would be binding with the Government agreeing to deliver whichever option won.But the risk would be that - just as with the indicative votes - MPs could be so ided that no motion gets a majority.If the process fails, another option for the PM is to bring back her existing deal for a fourth vote in Parliament.To get round John Bercows ban on holding multiple votes on the same issue, it would take the form of a Withdrawal Agreement Bill enshrining the deal into legislation.Mrs May hopes that the rise of Nigel Farage would prod Tory rebels and Labour backbenchers into joining her side so the Commons can finally deliver on Brexit.Today deputy leader Tom Watson backed Sir Keir, saying Labour is the Remain and reform party.But Housing Secretary James Brokenshire told the BBC: Keir is obviously setting out a slightly dferent message to the core message the Labour partys been giving about a second referendum.These talks are about how we give effect to leaving the EU, not somehow reopening the debate all over again.Jeremy Hunt hit out at the idea of a second referendum, saying: Weve always said that this would be a betrayal of what people voted for and we want to deliver on the first referendum.And Labour MP Stephen Kinnock warned against his own party bringing the talks down, saying: What would be a real shame isthe talks are failing because they are being torpedoed by an additional red line that Labour is bringing in around a second referendum.Talks between Labour and the Tories began last month after Brexit was delayed until October .But they are seen as unlikely to make headway because of Labours demand to keep Britain in the customs union.Tory minister Tobias Ellwood blasted today: Labour havent been very clear what they want, they just want to sow confusion.DELAYING Brexit is damaging British businesses, a top Bank of England boss warned today.Deputy governor Ben Broadbent said pushing back the EU exit deadline again would plunge firms into fresh uncertainty.And he suggested thata Brexit deal is signed off, the economy will soar as business breathes a sigh of relief.Mr Broadbent told the Press Association: Its pretty clear that investment has been feeling the consequences of the uncertainty about Brexit and particularly the possibility of a bad outcome.He said it makes sense for firms to wait for newsthey expect the news to come soon.The bank chief added: If you continually expect news to arrive imminently -

The public face of the group is ex-Google engineer Cheryl Hung.The group has no political ties, no links to established Remain campaigns and no other funding - and early indications are that the Lib Dems, Greens, Change UK, the SNP and Plaid Cymru will all feature in the regional recommendations.As things stand at the moment, Ms Hung said Remain parties could likelyjust seven MEPs to Brussels - but with Remain Votersapos help, tactical voting could increase this signicantly.    Why are they doing it  Well according to Ms Hung her sole aim is to remain in the EU as she is worried about the damage leaving the union will do to the UK. She added: We understand that party politics, political reality and technical factors prevented a pro-Remain alliance. We are asking people to join forces, get together and make their vote count so their voice can be heard. Nigel Farage might be telling everyone he has it all sewn up but together, as Remain voters, we can be a real force for good. We are behind all-pro Remain parties, she said. We are cutting through the heat and noise of party politics and letting the data provide clarity for Remain voters. We are conscious of the responsibility that we have, so transparency is critical.    How does it work  Unlike other tactical voting websites, Remain Voter has experienced data scientists and mathematicians who have built a DaposHondt model which will openly and transparently display predicted results based on the latest polling, without party political bias We are techies, open source advocates and data scientists, said Ms Hung. We use independent polling data, and the algorithms will be open sourced so anyone can very the recommendations for themselves.    We are not funded by think tanks or other interests. We arenapost looking for seats, jobs or a pay cheque. We are all volunteers. This is a grassroots approach. People have called us Led by Donkeysapos geeky little sister. The team is putting the finishing touches to its model, which will give voters a clear indication on which Remain political party to vote for on May  in all of the  UK regions that are sending MEPs to Brussels.

Initial figures suggest at least  people were turned away from polling stations across eight of the ten regions targeted to test out the plan. Some  voters were turned away in Derby alone. And on average  voters failed to vote in each pilot this year, an increase from  in pilots held around last year’s local elections. Dferent voter ID schemes are on trial in each region, each requiring some combination of photo ID or other kinds of ID. On election night the Mirror revealed an -year-old woman was denied the right to vote in Pendle, where a total of  people were turned away. The pensioner attacked the “stupid” system after taking a taxi to her local polling station in Pendle, Lancashire, only to be told she couldn’t vote. She told the Mirror she brought a photograph of herself, rather than a photo ID, after she misunderstood the instructions.   Cat Smith, Labour ’s Shadow Minister for Voter Engagement, said: As we feared, legitimate and honest voters have been denied their right to vote because of these undemocratic and unpopular pilot schemes.Time and time again Labour has warned that Voter ID will make it harder for people to vote but the Conservatives have pushed on with their blatant attempt to rig the result of future elections by voter suppression. After another round of shambolic pilot schemes, itaposs clear that Voter ID has no place in our democracy and should be abandoned immediately. It came as a cross-party letter urged ministers to abandon the plan, saying it would disproportionately affect vulnerable people and communities and was an attempt at voter suppression.”   The letter, from Labour, the Liberal Democrats , SNP , Plaid Cymru and the Green Party read: “The Windrush scandal has demonstrated very clearly that it can be more dficult for some communities to provide official documentation than others.“As representatives of major opposition parties, we believe that what is really going on here is a blatant attempt by the Conservatives to rig the result of future elections by making it harder for people to vote – it’s voter suppression. “At a time when millions of people are missing from the electoral register, we won’t allow this government to close down our democracy. “In light of the overwhelming evidence base, we are of the collective view that these dangerous voter ID trials must be scrapped as a matter of urgency.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire every british child","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Every British child matters...not just royal onesMay and whoever succeeds her will never fix the problem because protecting the privileges of the few over the many is in the Tories’ DNAShareCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionKevin Maguire - Every British child matters...not just royal ones\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNothing gives grotesque ­inequality a royal seal of approval so much as a lucky baby born ­seventh in line to a throne in a country where one in every three children lives below the breadline.

The leaflet, produced by the Conservative Party ahead of the European elections, encourages supporters to lobby Brexiteer MPs who voted down Theresa May ’s Brexit deal.The leaflet, entitled “How to show you want a Brexit deal delivered as soon as possible” says “for a deal to pass it needs the support of more than half of all MPs. It includes a photograph of Mrs May, who is quoted as saying: “At this critical moment for our country, parties should not be playing politics - or acting for their own personal gain. We need to come together, stay the course, and deliver Brexit in the national interest.    The leaflet points readers to a website where they can enter their postcode to see how their MP voted on the Brexit deal. It then offers to send an email directly to the reader’s MP, and in the process captures their address and email data to add to Tory email and canvassing lists. Former minister Priti Patel said the leaflet was “totally unbelievable.”    The outraged ex-International Development Secretary said: “The Conservative party has reached a new low when it is campaigning against its own Members of Parliament.” The leaflet goes on to suggest the EU elections could be cancelledMPs back the PMaposs deal before polling day - next Thursday. It reads: “If a majority of Members of Parliament back a deal in time, we could cancel the elections and get on with leaving the European Union - and all the other important issues facing our country. “At this critical moment for our country, parties should be playing politics - or acting for their own personal gain. “We need to come together, stay the course, and deliver Brexit in the national interest.

Simonie Starkey, , will erect a huge screen on the big day so her Liverpool-supporting groom and his best man - a Spurs fan - can watch the match. The -year-old is due to marry James Mabbett, , on June  at All Saints Church in North Ferriby, Yorkshire. James is a lelong Liverpool FC fan and his beloved Reds will be playing Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League final on the same day. On top of that, the man who will stand beside him - his brother Phil Mabbett - is an avid Spurs supporter. After the unbelievable drama in midweek, the two brothers were faced with the dilemma of how they were going to be able to watch the game, Hull Live reports.    James said: Our dad was a lelong Liverpool fan and he is the reason I am. He watched all the Champions League games last season but he had a quick illness and passed before the final. “We were of the belief that there is some sort of ine intervention for us to do this. For us to face each other on the wedding day it is mad. Me and my brother said there is a strange force behind this. It is mad it has happened. Best man Phil, who has supported Spurs for  years, added: He passed away nearly a year ago now. He loved his football and he would have loved this to have happened. James had to have the toughest conversation any man could face and break the news to his fiancee Simonie. Fortunately, she was on board all the way. “When I first found out about it, I did have a bridezilla moment,” joked Simonie. “But it is an important game for James and Phil and it is an important event. “Knowing I will be sharing my important day with another important event I did think where is everybody’s head going to be. “I am one of those who believe it is all or nothing. I am not going to stop them watching the game. If we are going to do it we are going to do it big.”  The couple have decided to have a projector showing the match on a big screen to cater to those who want to watch the game, with a disco on the other side of the marquee for those less interested. Simonie admitted even she may get distracted. “He [James] has converted me,” she said. “I never used to watch football but seeing how passionate he is I started following the games. “I will have to keep swapping between busting moves and looking at the score. I have not been to Anfield but it is on my bucket list.”  Liverpool staged a remarkable comeback on Tuesday night when they beat Spanish giants Barcelona - at Anfield to make the final. James said: “I knew the final was going to be on the same day. I had it in the back of my mind and was thinkingwe lose I am dodging a bullet. I didn’t want to have that conversation. I didn’t give us much of a chance. “When we got the first I was like, okay that creates a little bit of atmosphere. But when the second and third went in me and my brother went wild.” The following evening, Spurs were - down at half-time against Ajax and looked destined to be knocked out of the Champions League.  Phil says that he called in a favour from his dad. He said: “I remember watching the game at half-time and thinking aposthis is over, we are not going to come back from thisapos. “I am not religious but I said, ‘come on pops, do us a favour, help us out’. The second half started and Lucas Moura ran away with it and came up with the winner. After the game, Phil sent his brother a picture of himself in his Spurs shirt with the caption, ‘may the best man win’. James says that he will try and smuggle his Liverpool shirt in for the big day so he can perform his usual pre-match ritual. “I will have to smuggle my shirt in,” he said. “It is important for such a big match that I have to go through my normal routine. “I will always watch the game with the shirt on and kiss the badge three times before kick-off. What football can do to a grown man is incredible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"clue proud dad prince harry","story":"NewsClue that proud dad Prince Harry may have taken new photo of Meghan Markle and Baby ArchieMeghan Markle and Prince Harry shared a lovely new photo of Baby Archie Harrison to mark American Mothers DayShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsMeghan Markle shared a sweet photo of baby Archie to mark US Mothers Day \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email New parents Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delighted fans by sharing an adorable snap of their sonaposs feet to mark Motheraposs Day in the US.

Finbar Boyle, , from Ballyhaise, County Cavan, Ireland, was spared prison when he was sentenced in , however he could now be put behind bars due to an appeal by prosecutors. The dad-of-four was handed a suspended prison term after spending his schoolaposs money on Spanish golfing trips, weekend city breaks and clothes. Also known as Fionbar O Baoill, he had even put some of his ill-gotten gains towards his mortgage. He was head of a primary school for children from disadvantaged communities that received extra state support as a result of its DEISdesignation. Boyle could have faced up to a decade behind bars but in March last year, a judge decided to spare him jail because he’d managed to pay back €,and shown “remorse”. Judge John Aylmer showed leniency after Boyle’s lawyers argued to the court that his “signicant fall from grace” was affecting his efforts to find a new job. Now, director of public prosecutionsClaire Loftus has taken action against the suspended sentence. Today, DPP lawyers will ask appeal judges to review the case and consider sending him to jail, the Irish Mirror reports.    Boyle, who had no prior convictions, was principal of St Patrick’s National School in Kilnaleck, County Cavan, between  and . In , he cancelled school meals for kids at the small rural mixed primary, claiming a grant from the Department of Social Protection had been stopped. In fact, the school was still receiving the grant – and Boyle was keeping the money for himself. Gardai eventually caught up with him, arresting him in March  following a two-year police probe. It later transpired Boyle had embezzled a total of €,from state and also school funds. At court, he pleaded guilty to five sample charges – including theft of €,from the Department of Social Protection between November  and February . One court sitting heard he spent €,on the school credit card alone. His ill-gotten gains were splashed on golfing trips as well as weekend breaks in London, Dublin and Galway, Cavan Circuit Court heard. He purchased clothes as well as golf equipment and lessons, it was heard. And he put some of the cash towards his mortgage and household bills.    However, Judge John Aylmer indicated in  a non-custodial sentence would be “considered”Boyle could repay €,to the school. He said: “I am not going to make any promises, but I am currently minded that it may be open to me to take a non-custodial approach.” The judge gave him  months to cough up – and with the help of family and friends, Boyle raised the cash ahead of his final sentencing hearing in March last year. During that hearing, the court heard he had endured a bitter orce and had since suffered a breakdown. Boyle was on €-a-weeksocial welfare and had to travel in order to spend time with his young children, his defence team pleaded. His lawyers also claimed he’d suffered with “underlying and undiagnosed” psychological issues from a young age. It was also heard he was living in Ballybofey, County Donegal, and had a new partner with whom he was expecting a child. Judge Aylmer remarked on the “signicant breach of trust” and that the €,paid back was a “fraction” of what was taken. But he noted Boyle’s many character references and lack of prior convictions – and handed him two-year suspended prison terms on each count. This morning, three top judges – Court of Appeal president George Birmingham, sitting with Judges Isobel Kennedy and John Edwards – will begin hearing the DPP’s appeal.

Dean Smethurst, , had his national lotto card checked in Tesco on May  and was told by the woman on the checkout he had won on the Saturday game. The supermarket worker told Dean the machine said she could not pay out his winnings and he would have to instead contact Camelot. This prompted Dean to check the terms and conditions of the Camelot website - where he realised this message was usually given for wins of at least £k which could not be paid out in a retail shop. In a state of shock, Dean - a supermarket manager who has played the lottery for six years - dashed home before telling all of his friends and family the news. He began to work out what he could spend the money on and aposcracked open the bubblyapos - without thinking to check his numbers against the draw.    However, when the lottery phone lines opened again the next morning, Dean was given the devastating news that his luck was out. His win actually turned out to be three lucky dips on a future game - worth just £ each. He said: I didn’t sleep because I was so excited. My house is like a building site at the moment so that was the first thing that I decided to spend my winnings on. Then I decided to treat the family to a luxury holiday to Barbados. I spoke to the checkout girl and gave her the serial number of the ticket. She inputted it and said: ‘Well done, you’ve won...three lucky dips’. I asked hershe was sure, and then I asked to speak to a manager. I am absolutely gutted. I thought, ‘this is it, it’s for real, my numbers have come up’. I never thought to check my numbers, I didnapost think a company as large as Camelot could have got it wrong, I didnapost understand.    His roller-coaster ride to riches and back began on Wednesday evening when he had his lotto card checked at the Farnworth Tesco store, Lancs., - a store where he worked earlier in his career. Dean said: “I’d gone in to do a bit of shopping and I thought I’d check to see how I’d gone on in the previous Saturday’s draw. “All the other staff applauded me. “The receipt said I’d won a prize, that the store would not be able to pay it out and that I should contact Camelot immediately.” Unfortunately, the phone lines were closed for the night so Dean went online and learned that he had potentially won at least £,. He then set about about sharing the good news with his nearest and dearest. When the Camelot phone lines reopened at am on Thursday an excited Dean, who is currently in the process of renovating his £, home, made the phone call he thought would change his le for ever. It emerged that because the Wednesday lottery draw was in progress while Dean had his Saturday ticket checked, the checkout girl got that particular receipt message.  Dean said: When I had purchased the ticket I had bought one for both the Saturday and Wednesday draw. As the Wednesday draw was in the process of taking place, it looks like this was an automated message instead which would have been given for any win. I was absolutely gutted. It is back to the drawing board now. A spokesman for Camelot said: “In this instance, the player attempted to claim a prize during a aposdraw breakapos, when National Lottery sales are suspended while a draw takes place. The prize couldn’t be paid out at that time - because the ticket was still entered into a aposliveapos draw - so a validation slip was printed instead. To clary, this generic slip is used for a number of scenarios - itaposs not exclusively used for high-tier prizes. Poor Dean was relieved he had the day off on Thursday so he didnapost have to face his colleagues . He said: I just watched television and my mum made me some comfort food, which wasnapost much comfort.

The stunning labyrinth of passageways, which previously attracted ghost hunters, have now been ruled out of bounds by the city council. While many tunnels are well known by locals - such as the one that runs from the Tiger bar to the Corn Market - others are a mystery to most.As recently as  a forgotten passageway was found behind a doorway in the cellar of the Dolphin pub, The Derbyreported.For more than two decades ghost walks of up to  people would tip-toe into the pubaposs cellar and explore the brick-lined passages. One day the pubaposs landlord Richard Felix removed bricks from a hidden doorway in the cellar and scrambled through a tiny hole into the pitch black space beyond.    It is thought that through that passage grave robbers would deliver bodies to a doctor who once lived in the building, which dates back to . The medic would carry out illegal dissections on the corpses, the story goes. Tunnel enthusiasts are convinced that there are miles of similar passageways unknown to the public which could hold more spooky secrets.  At the end of one of the barrel-vaulted tunnels - which were once used to transfer prisonsers to court - is a locked door, maintained by Derby City Council. It is thought that behind it lie further strands of the brick-passageways, perhaps providing access to previously unvisited parts of the city. It looks like whether or not thataposs the case wonapost soon be found out. In February last year the Tigeraposs landlord, Jonathan Charlie May, received a letter from a senior estates surveyor at the council.    It said: Following an urgent review of safety measures of visitors in the Guildhall tunnels, the council has regrettably had to make the decision to not permit any further walking tours of the tunnels for the foreseeable future. The council recognises the historic interest in the tunnels and is exploring opportunities to again open the tunnels to the paying public in a safe and secure environment. In the  months since the tunnels beneath Tiger have been completely closed to the public. Landlord Charlie said: I donapost knowshe was joking, but she saidthere was a terrorist incident they could escape through the tunnels.    I wasnapost very happy. Itaposs not just my business - itaposs the tourism. Thereaposs not much  going on - the nightle of Derby is stagnant. Youaposd think [the council] would want to help, not hinder. And why now  Itaposs been going more than  years. All of a sudden itaposs a health and safety risk. Thousands of people have been down these tunnels - I have never known an incident. Charlie even offered to pay half the costs of any repairs health and safety experts reccomended. A spokeswoman said: The tunnels are closed and will remain closed until the Market Hall scaffolding has been removed and structural work has been completed in . At that point, a decision will be made whether the tunnels can be reopened. ” "},{"url":null,"title":"teenager pulled burning plane way","story":"NewsTeenager pulled from plane crash on way to Man United game recalls horror ordealJack Moore and his sister Billie Manley were on their way to see Manchester United play Cardf at Old Trafford when the plane went down on the AShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsJack Moore survived the crash with his uncle and sister \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teenager pulled from a burning plane alongside his little sister and uncle has said it is unbelievable they are all alive.

Freya Yhia-Raine, one, had just begun tucking into the tasty treat when the seagull swooped on her and attacked. Mum Cathryn Raine, , said the tot was determined to hold on to the cheese pasty and the ensuing tussle left her with a large painful bruise covering her left ear. Now the youngster, who needed a doctors’ visit after the attack, has been left terried of birds and too scared to eat outside – while Cathryn claims she had to endure a visit from social services because of the injury. Cathryn, from South Shields, County Durham, said: “We had a seagull scuffle. It just swooped down out of nowhere and ed into the pram.  “I’d got her a cheese pasty from Greggs and was pushing her in her stroller and this seagull tried to take the food out of her mouth while she was eating it. “Freya has no sense of fear. She wouldn’t let her food go. I tried to grab it off her so I could throw it for the seagull but she was holding onto it for dear le. “She had it half in her mouth and the seagull was trying to pull it out of her mouth. “It was flapping its wings and hitting her, so I’m not sure whether it was the wings or its beak that caused the bruising.  “At first I think she thought it was funny but then its wings started hitting her and she started to scream. “She was petried. People started to come over to see what was going on. “It was horrible. She wouldn’t stop crying. “I was just thinking I needed to get the pasty off her and get the bird way before it caused some real damage. “The whole thing lasted about  seconds but it felt like ages. “Finally I managed to yank the pasty away and the bird followed it. It wasn’t scared of people at all, it just wanted the pasty.”  Full-time mum Cathryn, who lives with Freya’s dad Lewis Yhia, , said she took Freya, who will be two next month, to her grandma’s house to try and calm her down. When she noticed the bruise she took her straight to the doctor fearing she would need a tetanus jab. Cathryn said: “I was so worried she’d have to have an injection but thankfully she didn’t. “Because it was such a bad bruise on her left ear the doctors had to call social services who came to see me the next day. “They came and said it was the seagull that had caused the injury but couldn’t determineit was caused by its beak or wing. “The bruise was purple for about three or four days and took a week and half before it went away completely.  “Now she won’t eat any food outside at all and she’s terried of birds – even pigeons. I don’t think she’ll be going near them anytime soon. “It could have been a lot worse. I dread to think what could have happenedit had been a baby in the pram. “She was such a bubbly, confident little girl with no fear before this but it’s really knocked her.” Cathryn, who was hit herself by the seagull’s wings, said there’s a real problem with seagulls in her area. She added: “I’ve known a few people who’ve gone to hospital after being pecked by a seagull because it’s drawn blood. “You can’t do anything about them. I live close to the seafront and it’s a big issue. They’re really bold and will take anything.

In the s Washoe the chimp became the first non-human to learn to communicate using American sign language. She was taught  signs by behavioural scientists and was soon able to construct basic sentences.    But in  she stunned her keepers by showing empathy and a motheraposs pain of losing a child.... Washoe, then , had grown close to a pregnant volunteer named Kat Beech who worked at her university home in Washington. The chimp loved Kat, and used to point to her growing belly and say “BABY.” Sheaposd been pregnant herself but lost both offspring, one to a hear defect and the other to a respiratory illness, and became depressed afterwards. But Kataposs growing bump fascinated her. Then, one day Kat abruptly stopped visiting and Washoe was clearly puzzled and upset. By the time she ed several weeks later, Washoe had the hump and gave Kat the cold shoulder. So Kat made her apologies to Washoe, and decided to tell her the truth...that she had suffered a miscarriage. So she signed: MY BABY DIED.    Washoe stared at her, then looked down. She finally peered into Kataposs eyes again and carefully signed CRY, touching her cheek and drawing her finger down the path a tear would make on a human – even though chimpanzees don’t shed tears. And When Kat prepared to leave that day, Washoe signed PLEASE PERSON HUG. It was a remarkable moment in a truly remarkable story. Born in Africa in  Washoe been orphaned when her mother was killed by hunters. She was captured by the US Air Force and destined for space programme research. But at  months old the tiny chimp was adopted by cognitive researchers, R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix T. Gardner. They established a project to teach Washoe ASLat the University of Nevada in Reno. Other projects had failed to teach chimpanzees to imitate vocal languages and the Gardner believed that was because chimps are physically unable to produce the right sounds. They raised Washoe like a child. She frequently wore clothes and sat with them at the dinner table.  She had her trailer complete with living and cooking areas, a fridge couch, drawers and a bed with sheets and blankets. She had combs, toys, books, and a toothbrush and would play outside and go for rides in the family car. One day she saw a swan and signed water and bird. When a researcher put a doll in her drinking mug she signed “Baby in my cup” and another time she signed to her teacher “aposYou me out go.” He replied, “OK, but put clothes on” and Washoe immediately put on a jacket. When Washoe was five, the Gardneraposs decided to move on to other projects and she was moved to the University of Oklahomaaposs Institute of Primate Studies under the care of Roger and Deborah Outs. In an article for Psychology Today in  Roger Fouts recalled his time with Washoe and how it convinced him that “chimp and human minds are fundamentally alike” and that they could show empathy. He said: “At the Institute Washoe was no longer the baby of the family- living with chimpanzees a few years younger than herself “It was a sort of home for wayward chimpanzees, so there were always young chimps coming and going.

It is unbearable to see this. Unbearable, said one horried woman.  Silvia Barquero, president of the Party Against Mistreatment of Animals , said that “only a twisted and perverse mind would be able to torture an animal until blood drips down its legs and wipe its face with a handkerchief. Footage of the incident has gone viral throughout Spain where bullfighting still ides opinion. Traditionalists say it is an integral part of the Spanish culture and heritage whilst opponents say the cruel and degrading sport should be banned. Bullfighting code requires the matador first taunt the beast with his cape before sticking sharp swords into the animal to anger it.

The video clearly shows Morante de la Puebla reaching into his pocket to get his handkerchief and wipe away the bullaposs tears on both eyes before making the kill.  A spokesman for Pacma Cordoba said: The gesture of Morante de la Puebla drying the tears of a bloody and tortured bull is insane and perverse. It is a cruelty without limits.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less.

And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented. Plans are now afoot for a further event in May to create an installation that looks at the impact of plastic on the countryside.Most recently three of the leaders, David Smart, Anne Smart and John McCartan took the chance to abseil  feet off the Falkirk Wheel. This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer.

Therersquos natural field run off, from the field to the south.ldquoMost of that seems to occur to the west of the site, but wersquore going to prevent any more run off by installing a cut off drain all the way around the site which will collect the water.ldquoThis drain will be connected to a culvert which runs under the railway to the north, and eventually runs into the Eye.ldquoThe other issue is that surface water is getting into the combined sewer that serves this area, and is causing problems down stream.ldquoSome road gullies are connected into this combined sewer and are causing surcharge of the sewer and in some cases flooding.ldquoWersquove out careful design into this, and wersquore not taking surface water to the combined sewer, wersquore taking it to the culvert under the railway.ldquoIt will be taken off at a very attenuated rate, at just two litres a second, which is a very small amount of water. The culvert could take up to  litres.Following an hour-long discussion, councillors were finally able to decide that the proposals could go ahead, providing that in depth surveys were conducted into drainage and foul water flooding.The site will then be subject to planning conditions once the scale of the problem is known.Speaking in favour of approving the planning application, Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford said: ldquoWe have to ask ourselves: do the proposals represent a suitable development  I think yes they do.ldquoAre the proposals acceptable in terms of parking and road safety  I think yes they are.ldquoI am a little concerned about industrial traffic but I feel this could be mitigated by an industrial road.Lauderdale and Melrose councillor Tom Miers told the committee: ldquoI think for me the main concern is absolutely drainage and flooding.ldquoWe need to be absolutely certain that any new development will not exacerbate any existing problems.ldquoI think it would be useful to include a condition that we require written evidence that the development will not add to the issues.ldquoIt needs to be in black and white, that according to the evidence it will not create more problems.East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton said: ldquoThere must be some sort of attenuation to the drainage. If that work was done before construction starts, then that would be useful.ldquoIt would be the best option to make sure this is all in place before any work starts.Councillors voted to approve the application, with the exception of Galashiels and District councillor Sandy Aitchison, who voted against."},{"url":null,"title":"junior-choir-delights-with-anniversary-show","story":"REVIEWBy Revd Pamela StrachanEddleston Junior ChoirAN exploding lsquoTreble Clefrsquo culminated an evening of joyous music from the Eddleston Parish Church Junior Choir last Friday evening, as Musical Director, Lorraine Mulholland, cut the spectacular Pintildeata cake.Baked by one of the Junior Choir mothers, Teresa Bedford, the fabulous cake was a fitting tribute to  years of this little choir bringing its vitality and exuberance to worship in the church.As well as giving regular concerts over the years, the young singers have raised money for charity, made their own CD and brought joy to the elderly in residential homes in Peebles.The choir has also been the starting point for many talented young musicians who have gone on to become accomplished young soloists, as we heard on Friday evening.The programme began with a touching performance of lsquoHumility  Appreciationrsquo from The Little Triangleand was followed by solo pieces from past choir members.After learning the piano for merely a year, young Izzy Steele gave a confident performance of two solo pieces, along with a duet of Bobby Shafto.Izzy already plays with great expression as the audience heard Bobby cheerfully setting sail but then becoming queasy with seasickness only for his spirits to lt as he heads for home once again.Very competent performances followed by both Jenner Brownand Shona Sinclairas they demonstrated how participation in the Junior Choir has fostered their talent and love of music.Jenner played lsquoRussianrsquo by Martrei Blanter, Blue Dayand Allegro Assai rd Movement from Concertino in D Major by Ferdinand Kuchler.These pieces would have been a challenge for older players, but this young violinist played with great panache.Shona Sinclair gave a similarly spirited performance on the piano with Branle de la Torche by Michael Praetorius, Shadows by Walter Carrol and the lively Scott Joplin number, The Entertainer.Rowan Steele, older sister of Izzy, delighted the audience with her performance on fiddle, with Farewell to the Glenand A Set of Shetland Reels.Rowan and Jenner then performed together on violin and fiddle with The Love of the Islesand Stomach Steinway Man, written by Ian Lowthian who was born in the Scottish Borders where he still works as a music teacher and educator.The ten young singers who currently make up the Eddleston Junior Choir produce a lsquobig soundrsquo and sing with such obvious pleasure and enthusiasm.The Lemonade Kid by Peter Fardellgave them all scope for their exuberance, as did their repeat performance of A Midsummer Nightrsquos Dream by Kane and Kane.We were treated to this at the summer concert last year and such was the choirrsquos obvious delight in performing this number, we were told they requested to sing it again.That seems to be the secret of this young choirrsquos success all the young members thoroughly enjoy the singing and performing, the rhythm and the sheer pleasure of making music.Delighted parents in the audience confirmed how much their children enjoy belonging to the choir as Lorraine Mulholland was presented with bouquets and warmly thanked by the Reverend Calum Macdougall for her  years of dedication and commitment to so many young singers in Eddleston and Peebles.The Church, parents and the Eddleston community all owe a huge debt to this inspirational Musical Director and music teacher."},{"url":null,"title":"inspirational-stories-set-for-borders-book-festival","story":"INSPIRATIONAL stories will told at this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens.

These breakwaters are supposed to prevent that from happening.ldquoIf we can get sand onto the beach, it should stay.The plans, submitted and approved by East Lothian Council, include repairing or replacing an existing groyne on the southern end of the beach that has fallen into disrepair.A rock groyne will be created at the northern end of the beach, opposite the junction with The Vennel, with a concrete groyne towards the south, while a rock breakwater will also be included.The work is split into four sections, with the refurbishment of the existing groyne acting to retain the beach level in the area as it is currently.Secondly, the breakwater, in addition to providing direct protection to a limited section of the defence, will allow an assessment of the capacity for a natural beach to be developed.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Mr Hampshire said time had been taken to find the design most likely to boost the beach.But he added: ldquoThere are no guarantees ndash we are fighting against nature here.Mr Hampshire told community councillors he was hopeful work could start ldquoearly summer.Discussions have been ongoing for more than five years regarding what can be done to try to turn the clock back and see the beach looking as it did in the past.Previous suggestions have included bringing sand across from Crail and St Monans in Fe.Mr Hampshire said that had not been ruled out ndash and every option would be explored ndash but it would prove ldquoreally expensive.Pippa Swan, community council chairwoman, thanked Mr Hampshire for his efforts in bringing the scheme forward.She stressed the importance of the beach and said: ldquoI think East Beach is just part of the place that Dunbar is.ldquoIt has been a holiday destination for a long time and people remember it as a sandy place and a place of leisure.ldquoThis rocky quarry we have now is something that saddens a lot of people.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said they were not yet in a position to reveal the cost of the scheme.She added: ldquoWork identied as helping to tackle erosion concerns on the East Beach will go out to tender with a view to work starting later this year, hopefully before the autumn period."},{"url":null,"title":"knox-academy-pupils-and-staff-team-up-for-edinburgh-marathon","story":"A team of  will represent Knox Academy at the Edinburgh Marathon Festival in the half marathon.Eleven pupils and eight members of staff will all pull on special t-shirts highlighting that they are running for East Lothian Special Needs Playscheme .Alex Redford, a modern studies teacher at the school, said they were looking forward to taking to the start line on May .He said: ldquoS have really tried to embody the school values of Ambition, Respect and Community this year.ldquoThey have worked so very hard on ious fundraisers throughout the year and it has been great to see them really engage with the school values.Pupils Matthew Black, Dylan Brotherston, Isabelle Bowen, Elliot Cochrane, Harry Cunningham, Hana Elder, Adam Fairgrieve, Mateusz Juchniewicz, Max Leveque, Daniel Mackinnon and Lauren Taylor will be joined on the start line by Lana Borwick , Robert Flood , Susanne Fox , Steven Illingworth , Adam Miller , Thomas Salkeld , Suzie Stewartand Mr Redford.Pupil Dylan said: ldquoThere is a little bit of friendly rivalry between the pupils.ldquoObviously, we are all quite competitive with each other and we are quite close friends.

This was because I had never done it before. I canrsquot quite believe this myself that Irsquove left it to my late s to finally make the conquest.How many times I have said to myself, and my family, as we explored dferent parts of East Lothian, ldquowe must climb North Berwick Law someday as its distinctive shape loomed into view. Itrsquos a hill visible from so many places, just asking to be explored, but I always seemed to put it off. But finally I have done it.Itrsquos a huge pile of igneous rock, basically cooled and solidied lava, a remnant of ancient volcanic activity. Itrsquos a giant plug on a now-extinct volcanic vent. Folklore tradition has a very dferent origin for the hill, as I have already written about.When you stand at the base of the Law and peer up, you can see where the great glaciers of the Ice Age have scraped and polished the hillrsquos surface, making it quite rugged and craggy in places, and smoothed down in others. Itrsquos  feet high, not a mountain by any definition, yet still impressive. If it were in a hilly area we would notice the Law less, but it looms up from flatter landscape, right next to the sea, and so demands attention.No wonder it became a place of human settlement in the Iron Age period. How could you not use this hill as a location for a fort  Its steep, rocky braes are perfect for defence, itrsquos next to the sea with a ldquoview of the whole world, as my four-year-old put it ndash and was not entirely wrong!Cast your eye to the north and across the Firth was the land of the Picts. The open sea can be seen to the north east and almost the entire of East Lothian is laid out before you, to the Lammermuirs in the south and the Pentlands in the west.Here was the land of the Gododdin, the Celtic people who lived in our country when the Romans arrived, although they had a dferent name for them: the Votadini. They survived the Roman presence, perhaps entering into some alliance to preserve their tribe. The Romans were ruthless with those who did not co-operate and submit.But later, in the seventh century, long after the Romans had gone, the Angles arrived from the south. The Gododdin resisted the invasion. The great early poem Y Gododdin tells us of a great assemblage of warriors who feasted at Edinburgh before heading south to their deaths in battle.What wailing and sadness there must have been when the news of the loss of all those young, handpicked warriors arrived. The Goddodinsrsquo fate was soon sealed, the Angles took control of the land and the Lothians became part of the Northumbrian kingdom. The remnants of the disposed Gododdin migrated to Wales, it seems, taking with them their stories and legends of what became known as lsquothe old northrsquo.These were my thoughts as I found the remains on an old round house as we climbed to the summit of the Law. At first I wasnrsquot sure ndash it looked almost like a small standing stone circle ndash but on closer examination I realised the stones were the foundations of a Celtic round house. An archaeologist friend later confirmed this.There are at least  Iron Age round houses or similar structures so far discovered on the Law some are less obvious. Butyou carefully study the ground as you ascend, evidence of these ancient homes can be seen. There is also evidence of old walls or ramparts.So here a community of the Gododdin once lived. From their front doors they could see their sister forts of Dun Penderbut now named Traprain Law, and Din Eidyn, later to be called Edinburgh.So I entered the circle of stones as my kids played on a rock nearby. I was now in a space where once a family might have lived. It was not large, but then again, why would it be  It was a place to sleep and sit round the fire together. No need to make space for all the modern lsquonecessitiesrsquo of le. Their le would have been lived outdoors. But what stories were told in this intimate space, what lives were led, and when was the last night this was used as a home There is lots more to the history of North Berwick Law. The watch house from the Napoleonic period, the observation bunker from the Second World War and, of course, the whale bones, which are now made of fibreglass. All these connect to stories that make up the history of this fascinating wee hill.But for me on that day, it was the walk through prehistory, and the mysterious remains from an ancient Celtic people, that left my imagination tingling."},{"url":null,"title":"golfers-surprise-as-he-finds-guinea-pig-on-golf-course","story":"Engineer William Waddell, , was playing in the Lady Captainrsquos Day at the club in Prestonpans on April  when his friend hit a wayward ball on the ninth hole.Donna, Williamrsquos we, said: ldquoHe was looking for his friendrsquos ball when he saw something moving in the grass ndash he took a closer look and saw it was a guinea pig!ldquoHe picked it up and handed it in to the pro shop.The family put pictures of the furry find on Facebook and, in no time at all, a young girl came forward with her dad, another club member, to take care of it until the owner could be found.Donna added: ldquoThe dad happened to be an expert on guinea pigs, judging and showing them up and down the country, so they were the perfect people to take care of it really.ldquoWersquove all had loads of messages on social media from people offering to give it a home, so whatever happens, Irsquom sure itrsquoll be loved.William and Donna live in Duns with their two children Kiera, , and Jaydon, .Donna added: ldquoWersquore really keen to find out what will happen to the wee thing.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-needs-almost-600-new-foster-families","story":"Leading charity The Fostering Network say that based on annual recruitment targets and the number of carers who stop fostering each year, a total of  foster places need to be created throughout the rest of .Scots are now being urged to consider fostering a child as the charity marks the start of its annual Foster Care Fortnight campaign.Without extra families being found, some children will find themselves living a long way from their family, school and friends, being split up from siblings, or being placed with a foster carer who might not have the relevant skills and experience to meet their specic needs.Sara Lurie, director of The Fostering Network in Scotland, said: ldquoFor some children, no matter how much their mum or dad loves them, they are not able to look after them.

According to the Wine and Spirits Trade Association,  million bottles of gin were sold in Britain last year.Sales figures hit pound. billionndash pound.bn when exports are taken into account ndash breaking all previous records.The WSTA points out that just two years ago only a few brands were making flavoured gin, but last year the category was valued at pound million,up % on the previous year.Although still dwarfed by the whisky industry, which is worth more than poundbn to the UK economy, gin is said to be racing towards the poundbn barrier and expected to outperform the blended whisky sector by next year.So, in a nation soaked in whisky heritage and known the world over for its fine, smoky malts and smooth blends, why are we suddenly developing a taste for gin And where might it all leave our national drink According to Fiona Laing, author of Gin Clan, a new book that explores Scotlandrsquos flourishing gin sector, the spiritrsquos renewed success is rooted in the past but with some very modern ingredients. ldquoHistory, whisky, expertise and Scotlandrsquos natural resources all play their part, she says.ldquoThere is an energised community of gin makers who love exploring the rich botanical world and creating enjoyable flavours.ldquoMost importantly, there is a market made up of increasingly knowledgeable gin drinkers who seek out new experiences, alongside a more general thirst for consumable products that reflect the place they come from and respect for artisan skills.Scotlandrsquos ldquogin fling is not entirely new: Scots have enjoyed a gin tipple since the mid-th century, when Dutch ships laden with jenever ndash the juniper spirit that preceded gin ndash traded at Leith, Dundee and Aberdeen.By , some .m gallons of jenever was arriving on Scottish shores, while juniper was so abundant across the Highlands that large quantities were being sent back across the North Sea to make more of the spirit.While today three of the worldrsquos best-selling gins ndash Gordons, Tanqueray and Hendrickrsquos ndash are all produced in Scotland, it is dozens of small, artisan producers using inventive, sometimes bizarre, combinations of flavours, and sustainable approaches to gin-making, that have ignited the modern market.Laing points to Esker Spirits on Royal Deeside, where the gin was originally concocted in a garden shed and is laced with local rosehip, pink peppercorn, heather and sap tapped from silver birch trees.A zero-waste policy sees packaging reused and waste going to local farmersrsquo fields. The sustainable approach is at the heart of Arbikie Distillery in Angus, which emerged from a farm loaded with lsquowonkyrsquo potatoes that supermarkets didnrsquot want.Its gin contains kg of spuds in each bottle, while at Crossbillrsquos Hatchery at The Barras in Glasgow, which sources its juniper from limited stocks left in the Highlands, a botanical greenhouse is to be heated with waste from the distilling process.ldquoWe have this ingenuity along with people who are using the land around them to create their gin, adds Laing, pointing to Dundee Gin Companyrsquos use of Mackayrsquos Dundee Orange Marmalade and Dundee cake in its gins.Deliquescent from Kelso in the Borders is among the more unusual ndash therersquos a colour-changing rose gin, a parma violet version and, for Burns Night, a haggis gin.Some gin makers ndash such as Crafty Distillery in Newton Stewart ndash have taken inspiration from whisky rivals and positioned themselves as tourist attractions in scenic spots, offering tours and special bottles to take home as holiday souvenirs.Crafty, along with Glasgow-based McGin with its wry label depicting a woman mixing her gin in a bathtub and Glean Morrsquos traffic cone-topped Duke of Wellington statue on its Glasgow Gin, has embraced a lsquopunkrsquo style to set it aside from others which draw on folklore, historical figures and landmarks for creative inspiration.And, it seems, British drinkers are enjoying their tipple. Last summer more gin was sold in Britain than during the summers of  and  combined, while the spin-off artisan tonic market is also thriving.Market analysis from Vinexpo IWSR released last month suggests the gin sector will grow by .% by , and gin is so popular that the Office for National Statistics has added it back to the basket of goods used to measure inflation after a -year absence.Are whisky producers worried In some cases, Scottish gins are laying the groundwork for a new generation of whisky.Faster to produce, fledgling whisky distilleries, such as Dingwallrsquos community-owned Glenwyvis Distillery, are selling gin to provide income and develop their brand while they patiently wait for their first barrels to mature.Graeme Littlejohn, SWA director of strategy and communication, says: ldquoThe UK is the fourth largest global market for Scotch Whisky.This is despite the UK being a highly competitive drinks market and the high duty rate that means consumers pay pound in every pound spent on Scotch in tax.ldquoScotch Whisky has to mature for at least three years, so many new distilleries are making gin while waiting for their whisky. But the spirit we produce in Scotland is worth the wait, which is why  bottles of Scotch Whisky are shipped overseas from Scotland every second.Meanwhile, Laing says gin makers are continuing to innovate, with the focus on label and bottle design as important as the spirit inside, turning empties into collectables.ldquoSome empty bottles are so attractive, theyrsquore ending up as lampshades, she adds.At Pixel Spirits, based in North Ballachulish, Lochaber, spicy Devilrsquos Staircase gin, with its warm notes of cardamom, cassia and nutmeg, has a label illustrated by Iain McIntosh, best known for his Alexander McCall Smith book covers.While Strathmashie Distillery in Newtonmore, perhaps tops even that, with a striking original illustration by Robert McGinnis, the American artist behind scores of movie posters, including Breakfast at Tfanyrsquos, on its gin.As for the future, Laing predicts a new wave of flavours to keep the spirit on drinkersrsquo radars. ldquoFlavoured gin has driven over half the growth in gin, despite only making up one-fth of total sales, she says. ldquoSome say the next trend will be savoury flavours."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-do-not-elect-those-who-do-not-want-to-serve","story":"Looking over the ballot paper, I was amazedto see that the two major parties, who are still currently conspiring to agree a deal which will take us out of the EU, have the brass neck to field candidates.

Photographs and attributed quotes are given for seven people, four described as \"our candidates\" and the other three described as \"New Brexit Party Candidates\". So I guess it would be reasonable for voters to assume that, in placing their X against the Brexit Party, they are voting for any number up to six of these candidates, to be elected.If you have a postal vote and therefore can examine a ballot paper, it becomes more interesting, be-cause none of these seven names appear on it. So who are these seven candidates  In fact, they are all standing in English regions, except for Joel Chilaka, who doesnt appear to be standing anywhere in the UK. Of course you might only see who you are voting for when you get your ballot paper in the polling station and discover a new set of names.We are therefore expected to vote for the Brexit Party, without having the faintest idea who the candidates are, or why we should vote to elect them.

You need to ask for more than PR, it has to be Single Transferable Vote.Thomas GF Gray, Lenzie.PETER Russellrsquos letterreminded me of something published here some weeks ago, arguing the same point ndash ldquothatScotland uses Sterling in the informal way suggested by the Growth Commission, it can be contended that with no currency of our own, we could not commit to joining the euro when conditions allow , as we could not participate in ERM, and thus might not, just as Mr Russell asserts, be able to join the EU at all.Imagine my surprise to discover the letterrsquos author was hellip. me . However, in contrast to Mr Russellrsquos prognosis of doom, gloom and disaster, I continued ldquoBut, [Scotland] could still secure single market access by joining EFTA and committing to the EEA, and likewise frictionless trade by joining the EUrsquos Customs Union, and thus that ldquoevenwe are not EU members, we can still achieve many of Scotlandrsquos European ambitions. Furthermore, this would be in no way inconsistent with the statements of the First Minister since June , and, in regard to the EU at least, render obsolete questions about currency .His letter therefore is a trademark Better Together argument that the EU will not let us join, yet many European ambitions could be achieved without joining. However, my letter of which he is critical of was a reply to Ian Lakin who had argued that Scotland would have to use the euro , but as I pointed out the timetable to this end would be for the Scottish electorate. Thus, both Messrs Russell and Lakinrsquos arguments manage to be wrong, even though based on conflicting suppositions about our membership ndash or not ndash of the EU.This \"damnedthey do, and damn themthey donrsquot\" approach is one we became familiar with in . A particularly notable example then was that all the banks would leavewe voted Yes, but that they would ruin us in the event of another banking crash, which could only happenthey had remained in Scotland. As with Mr Russell and Mr Lakinrsquos propositions, both cannot be true at the same time. Not even in Scotland.Most remarkably though, having spent the preceding part of his letter assuring us that Scotland could not join the EU because we have no currency of our own, Mr Russell cannot resist the temptation of forecasting ldquoGreek-style austerity within the euro for Scotland once we had implemented our own currency. But in so doing he ignores the point that I made earlier to Ian Lakin, that by joining the EU we might have to commit to adopting the euro, but the timetable, and indeed deciding whether to do so or not, would be matters for the Scottish electorate.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.GEORGE Dale and Sam Craigask: have the parties given up on British voters in the run-up to the EU elections, and who would trust the leader of the Brexit Party  Perhaps we should look at those questions from a wholly Scottish perspective. At no time has the Scottish Government given up on trying to represent the Scottish people in Europe or at the Brexit negotiation table, it has simply been excluded. As to the second question, the Scottish people in  didnrsquot trust Nigel Farage under the Ukip banner, as Scotland voted to re-main.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.CAN I ask Carole Fordexactly where

Fergusson and deputy presiding officers Trish Godman and Alasdair Morgan are pictured with the July , , babies who visited Parliament for its th birthday. It is hoped they willfor the th celebrations. “But it was a joyful day the crowds turned out in force and we had the weather to go with it. “I was able to enjoy it once the hard work was done.“I remember walking down the Royal Mile, once the crowds had dissipated. Even then, I realised it was a once in a letime day.”There are many memorable occasions Paul can recall but one meeting in particular stands out.“There was a breakfast meeting attended by Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley,” he said. “Martin helped Ian to his feet and they walked across the garden lobby of the Parliament together.“As someone who followed Irish politics, I had to pinch myself. For that to have happened here in the Scottish Parliament – it’s a tremendous memory.“It was so symbolic and a reminder that even the strongest adversaries can come together.”One act of legislation is also lodged in Paul’s mind.“When the same sex marriage act was passed, there was a sense of jubilation in all parties and across Parliament,” he said.In his  years, Paul has been invited to breakfast at Bute House just once.But that breakfast will also live long in his memory.He added: “In , I was responsible for helping to run the referendum which saw the Parliament being re-established in Scotland.“It was a day of great anxiety but it had gone well, with only a few technical hitches – in a time when a fax machine was state of the art!“I finished work at am and got invited to Bute House for breakfast with Donald Dewar, Henry McLeish and Sam Galbraith.“One of my best memories is enjoying breakfast with them, while reflecting on what had been a great night for them politically and a great night for us too.“I’ve never been invited back for breakfast since – but you never know, it is the th anniversary this year!”The Parliament’s current presiding officer Ken Macintosh was one of the newbies in .Until being elected to represent Eastwood in , he was a BBC television producer, working on national news programmes.But encouraged by his we Claire, he sought election to the Parliament as a Labour Party candidate.Despite claiming not to be a career politcian, he was re-elected in ,  and . And in  he was elected as an MSP for West Scotland and became Presiding Officer.The eldest of their six children, Douglas, is  this month so  was a busy year for the Macintosh clan!He recalled: “It was a very exciting time in my le. “Claire and I had just got married a year before and our son was born five days before I was elected.“So it was exciting but slightly worrying as my we thought she’d married this sensible man, with a senior position in the BBC.“Then suddenly I was giving it all up for politics. “At the time, it was a little bit of a gamble from someone who is not a gambler!“But Claire encouraged me to stand. That was all the endorsement I needed.”Ken was more used to posing questions than being asked them but it was a relatively easy transition.He explained: “Whether it is reporting on current events or trying to shape them, it’s a reflection of the same set of interests.“I’d been a member of the Labour Party since I was a student but never, ever stood for an elected office.“But I was a big supporter of devolution and it was really that that made me put myself forward.“The whole idea of doing politics in a dferent way, having a erse group of voices, that was what grabbed me.“I used to be the person shouting questions at the Prime Minister which stood me in good stead. To become the person being shouted at was quite odd though!”Ken recalls the early days with great pride.“It’s dficult for people now to recall the air of excitement it was an era of real change,” he said.“Then there was a big backlash due to the cost of the building and politically some very dficult issues.“Section  was the one I remember very vividly. It was a confrontation of the old Scotland with the new.“The Scotland I was brought up in was not the tolerant, progressive country it is today...it was certainly not an easy country to be gay in.“Section  confronted that head on.”Another milestone for Ken was the smoking ban.“When I was a kid, people always talked about Scotland having the worst cancer record in Europe,” he said.“And here we were taking control of our own health.“We were criticised for being the nanny state but I still think of it as a statement of our self-confidence.“When I first started, the Parliament made videos and I was asked what my ambitions for Scotland were and who my heroes were. “My heroes were Kenny Dalglish and Elvis Presley. I’ve since met Kenny and he didn’t disappoint!“I also wanted Scotland to be more self-confident and the smoking ban was a sign of that.”Now,  years on, the Parliament has become the centre of public le.Ken added: “At the start, so many people were openly hostile and condescending about the Parliament. “It’s testament to the people of Scotland that they’ve since embraced it and made it their own.”Tracing babies who share Parliament’s birthdayA new exhibition will take centre stage in the Parliament for the th anniversary celebrations. It will feature many of the ordinary people who have had an impact on the Parliament during its -year history. Ken said: “We are always trying to find new ways of engaging with the public and, in many ways, that’s what the exhibition and the th anniversary is all about.”The community and engagement unit is also trying to track down the babies who were born on July , .The youngsters share their birthday with the Parliament and were a big part of the th anniversary. The hope is that they can all be reunited on Saturday, June , for the th birthday party.For more information on events, visit www.parliament.scot.

We have to look at this on the basis of the outcomes, not processes and will the Minister not accept that for the over s, the outcomes look pretty grim.”Responding on behalf of the Government, Margot James MP said: “I thank the Rt. Hon. Gentleman for his intervention and I am sure that the BBC will listen to the comments which he just made with which I have considerable sympathy. This was part of a fair deal for the BBC. At the time the BBC Director General, and I have already quoted him, that he did say also that it was a strong deal for the BBC and that it provided financial stability.”Adding further comment, Mr. Carmichael said: “It is easy to say you are sympathetic but still the Government is doing nothing to set it right. They have tried to duck responsibility by pushing it onto the BBC, but this is not about who is responsible, but what the impact is on the people who will be affected.“Over s are often on a low fixed pension, so to suddenly have an extra £ outgoing is a huge chunk of their income. Many older people are reliant on their TVs as a way of avoiding loneliness and stripping them of their TV Licence is likely to leave signicant numbers unable to watch their favourite programmes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The third prequalying bidder, the international ferry operating company Förde Reederei Seetouristik GmbH  Co. KG , decided not to pursue any further interest in the competition. Transport Scotland will evaluate bids received, with a view to having a new public service contract in place by  October .#Mr Wheelhouse added: #Simultaneously, Transport Scotland will continue its engagement with the European Commission to seek an early resolution to Pentland Ferries’ outstanding State aid complaint about the subsidies payable under the next public services contract.#Further information about Transport Scotland’s engagement with the Commission and any implications for the tender procedure will be announced in due course.#Responding to confirmation by the Scottish Government that the tendering of the Northern Isles ferry contract will proceed as set out in the original documentation, Orkney’s MSP Liam McArthur said: “This is welcome confirmation by the Minister that there should be no slippage in the timing for tendering the next Northern Isles ferry contract. However, the timeframe is tight and will be challenging for both bidders.“We need to see real improvements delivered through the next contract, including an increase in freight capacity and restoration of sailings on the Pentland Firth route.“Unfortunately, the Minister is unable to shed any light on when passengers on the Northern Isles routes can expect to benefit from RET. Almost a year on from the date for implementing RET, those using these leline services are still being forced to pay over the odds.

The strike action will last for  hours seeing Kirkwall Airport close to air traffic. Action short of a strike is also ongoing.The union representing the ATCs, Prospect, has said the announcement of the new date comes following the breakdown of talks held last week.Speaking yesterday, Mr McArthur said: “It is hugely frustrating that talks between the union and HIAL have broken down again. Agreement between both sides seems as far away as ever.“While any disruption to our leline services is a concern, I am alarmed that the proposed strike date clashes with the start of the Orkney Folk Festival.#This is an absolutely key event in the Orkney calendar, with performers and visitors flying in from all over the country and beyond. If all flights are cancelled, this will inevitably impact on the success of the festival.“I have been in touch with the unions, HIAL and Scottish Ministers over the course of today, urging all sides to do what they can to avoid this damaging action taking place. A resolution to the dispute is long overdue, but the priority at this stage would be to find an alternative date for any strike action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The specic needs of island areas must be properly taken into account and I have urged the government to undertake a proper islands impact assessment.  Any scheme that is introduced must be both affordable and accessible to those living in our island communities.#Mr McArthur said he also had concerns about the inclusion of glass within the scheme.He added: #Strong evidence from the successful scheme in Norway suggests that excluding glass can have benefits, both in encouraging the use of less environmentally damaging materials and helping smaller retailers in rural areas to participate.  “These and other issues will continue to be debated as the proposed legislation goes through parliament, but today’s announcement is a welcome step in the right direction.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are looking forward to partnering with them so that together we can ensure the future of our native wildle for the benefit of Orcadian environment and communities.#Orkney Native Wildle project is happy for anyone with comments or concerns to get in contact by phoning  .

The strike action will last for  hours seeing Kirkwall Airport close to air traffic. Action short of a strike is also ongoing.The union representing the ATCs, Prospect, has said the announcement of the new day comes following the breakdown of talks held last week.Prospect had previously called off a day’s strike on April  to allow the company to develop new proposals. As no new offer has been made and with no further talks scheduled the union has said an offer is not likely to be tabled.Notably, the new strike date is also the first day of the Orkney Folk Festival, which welcomes acts and visitors to the county from all over the world.David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer, said: “Members have run out of patience with HIAL. Talks have been ongoing for more than a year to seek to resolve this dispute but to no avail. Prospect agreed to withdraw our strike action in April to allow further talks to take place and members trusted that HIAL would use that time to bring forward proposals to resolve the dispute — HIAL have abused that trust.“Members do not want to take industrial action but have been left with no choice. If they want to prevent disruption across the highlands on May  and throughout the summer then Scottish Ministers need to intervene.”Responding, Highlands and Islands Airport Limitedmanaging director Inglis Lyon said they were #bitterly disappointed# and vowed to minimise any potential disruption wherever possible.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There will be local support for farmers, who will be able to obtain immediate permission rather than having to apply for a specic, inidual licence, which can take around ten days.This local licence follows a new goose policy which supports efficient, practical regulation for farmers and others affected by geese grazing.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles  North Highland area manager, has said: “We realise that farmers in Orkney have been struggling with the impact of large goose numbers, and this pressure has been increasing. We’re keen to work with farmers and land managers and support them in finding sustainable solutions to managing this problem, while still making sure we fulfill our nature conservation obligations.“We have been working hard to look at ways to give farmers more flexibility. As a result, we plan to introduce a greylag goose licence for Orkney to cover the closed season from  February to  June.“For the long term, we will also be working with an extended local Goose Management Group, alongside partners in NFUS, RPID and others, to try to explore new ways of managing the problem. We will be funding and administering this through the local goose management group in Orkney.”SNH have been discussing potential management tools and the new licence with NFU Scotland representatives in Orkney. Alan Corrigall, chairman of the Orkney Branch, said: “We are grateful to SNH for making the changes that will allow shooting to take place throughout the year, where necessary. Whilst the new licence will not control geese numbers in itself, it will make much easier for those undertaking shooting to get the necessary consent between February and June.#We also look forward to working with SHN and others as we explore other ways to reduce the resident greylag goose population to lessen the environmental and economic impact of the huge numbers of geese.#Resident greylag geese in Orkney have increased over the past  years.

It is an information gathering and assessment exercise which helps stakeholders, the public and the planning authority understand the potential environmental impacts of major development proposals.The Orkney Community Wind Farm Project could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney, say the council.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The scoping report for Faray is available at here. The scoping report for Quanterness is available at here.Councillor James Stockan is leader of Orkney Islands Council. He said: “We are keen to keep the public informed on this project as it develops. Our well-attended consultation events were very useful, and allowed a range of views and opinions to be expressed and we’re looking forward to carrying out a further event in Westray in June.#Once all the information events are complete, we’ll be looking to provide more online information on the project and in the meantime I’d encourage folk to take a look at the scoping reports for detailed information.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Having studied history at the Sorbonne in Paris, I was consistently struck by the long-lasting and little-known links that unite us: the Auld Alliance is not merely a gimmick beloved of rugby fans, it has united our peoples more deeply than we acknowledge today. Thousands of French people in the Berry and Anjou regions are descendants of Scots who settled there after fighting to help France regain its independence with Charles VII. When my grandfather was born, any French or Scottish citizen could still automatically obtain dual nationality!Were France to turn her back on this friendship forged with Scotland over the centuries, she would be neglecting her own history. We cannot build anything unless we enhance the coherence and strong links we have with our past. What’s more, French politicians cannot remain indferent to the burning question of your national destiny, one that has been asked for several years. Nicola Sturgeon has announced that legislation to organise a new referendum on Scotland’s independence by  will be presented shortly. At this time, Europe and France must speak with one voice on the European future of Scotland. This issue is fundamental. The result of the  independence referendum was influenced by this European aspect, given that by leaving the UK, Scotland may also have been obliged to leave the EU. In the end, because of the demagogues that pushed for Brexit, Scotland will most likely be unable to stay in the EU anyway!Deeply attached to the project of European construction, the Scots are being pushed towards the exit against their will. Such a situation deserves better than a closed door. The European Commission led by José Manuel Barroso made a big mistake in  when it explicitly closed the door to a deeply pro-European people, who have been fully-fledged members of the Community for the past  years. In stating that Scotland would have no place in Europe, it did not live up to its role, which had obvious repercussions on the result of the vote, undermining the project of an independent Scotland. Former French President François Hollande did not offer a helping hand in , committing an enormous error when he deemed that the issue of Scottish independence was merely one of British domestic politics. That is not true - the destiny of the Scottish people is a deeply European issue! France has no vocation to support or to oppose the will of the Scottish people to become an independent state, since this question is to be answered by those living in Scotland. However, France’s role is to state very clearly that in the event of independence, Scotland would have its place in the European Union, and should not be deprived of its European destiny. I called on the French President to express this position very clearly on the future of Scotland and Europe. Emmanuel Macron must not follow in his predecessor’s footsteps: the silence of European leaders on Scotland’s future does a disservice to the European ideal. How can Europe be revivedwe refuse to open our arms to one of our continent’s most pro-European peoples  Europe’s legitimacy is strengthened when it helps us do better what we cannot do alone, whether that means fighting climate change, creating a balance of power with China, or leading the US in terms of articial intelligence. To achieve this, we need the Scots who understood that Europe was not just a huge single market, but a powerful tool for our peoples. I deeply believe that an independent Scotland would have its place in Europe with no conditions and without delay, something of which it cannot be deprived. The deadlines and conditions imposed during the joining process are dependent on candidate states complying with EU treaties and regulations known as “acquis communautaires”. In this case, an independent Scotland would become one of the most developed states in the EU, having complied with the “acquis” for several decades. Now that the Spanish veto has been lted, nothing would prevent Scotland’s integration by way of an exceptional procedure, similar to the one used by the EEC when it integrated the German Democratic Republic in . The signicant choice you have to make by  belongs to you. With this in mind, remember that across the Channel, you can count on friends who have not forgotten that the Scots are a great European people, and that Scotland is a friend and a historical ally of France.Jean-Christophe Lagarde is a French MP and head of UDI party and Les Européens campaign©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch too late to stop brexit party bandwagon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Dead policies walking. Dead excuses on parade. Watching UK Education Secretary Damian Hinds on the Andrew Marr programme yesterday, I was reminded of Iain Duncan Smith#s #quiet man# routine # that last embarrassing attempt to postpone his inevitable removal as Tory leader. This time of course it won#t just be a politician but an entire party that fails. And the sure signs are wooden TV performances, where answers to straight questions sound like something from a Monty Python sketch.Will there be a Tory campaign launch for the European elections  No, we don’t think that’s necessary. Will there be a manesto  Well, we have lots of policies, I can explain themyou like.Within the context of the Brexit quagmire, this may seem unremarkable. But there are basic conventions about elections and one is that political parties publish manestos so voters know what they’re voting for. I can’t think of another election in which the governing party has failed to comply with this most fundamental part of the pact between politicians and voters. The most astonishing thing is that Theresa May thinks she’s got away with it, like a child hiding behind a book who thinks the rest of the world has disappeared. But politics doesn’t work that way, as the Conservatives are about to discover, courtesy of Nigel Farage.The latest opinion polls suggest the Brexit Party is set to win the forthcoming Euro elections and could potentially become the largest party at any subsequent Westminster poll.  per cent of Tory members say they’ll back Farage along with  per cent of Tory councillors. Asked how she’d be voting by Radio  Live, Brexiteer Tory MP Maria Caulfield answered “I don’t know.” But actually, this is no dferent to the last European elections in  when Nigel Farage unleashed his much-promised political earthquake. Ukip stormed to victory with  per cent of the vote and  MEPs, precipitating David Cameron’s promise of an EU referendum in the Tories’  manesto. That general election saw Ukip come third in terms of the popular vote, but ended up with just one MP thanks to Westminster’s broken first-past-the-post system. The Tories’ .m votes produced  seats – Ukip’s .m votes produced just one seat. The Greens were similarly cheated. Evenyou oppose Ukip’s politics, go figure how that can be called democracy.Farage’s opponents heaved a sigh of relief. It might not have been the ideal way to defeat him, but any port in a storm. How wrong they were. Voters may not have been storming the barricades demanding PR and the unelected House of Lords unaccountably produces less voter ire than the unelected European Commission – but let’s not misread the signs. Like referred pain in the human body, the hurt of Brexit relates to dys where in the body politic. Broken British democracy is the problem and it feeds the Ukip Brexit insurgency. Not being elected has actually suited Farage. It has let him play the martyr, evade political scrutiny during his fraudulent Brexit campaign, then slip away when the going got rough. Because his real, popular support was unacknowledged by British democracy, Farage was able to guilt-trip and browbeat broadcasters, becoming a near constant presence on opinion-forming news outlets. Above all, the unelectable Farage needed no manesto. He just made it up as he went along. And now the Tory party, the government of this country, is playing the same low game.Is it too late to stop the Brexit Party bandwagon  Yes, it is.Farage ran amok on Question Time last week, speaking over every contributor and leaving the programme unwatchable for all but his supporters. Aunty retrieved itself somewhat yesterday when Andrew Marr gamely challenged Farage on his oft-overlooked far right policy stances which include replacing the NHS with a system of private health insurance. But that will hardly dent his support. Ukip has moved so far to the racist right that Farage looks almost respectable, and having Boris – the “lovable face of far right-wing lunacy” - as Tory leadership contender doesn’t hurt either. For voters who believe Brexit is the panacea for all Britain’s ills, there’s still only one game in town.But the newness of his latest party vehicle shouldn’t disguise the fact Farage is still the old Farage. The added potency of the Brexit Party this time round derives from one simple fact. In the five years since his party won European elections but got no formal role within British politics, absolutely nothing has changed. The Tories still haven’t made their minds up about Brexit, neither has Labour. Britain is still the most centralised top-down society in Europe and in a quarter of seats it still doesn’t matteryou turn out and vote or not. From the Scottish perspective, the only change since  is Holyrood’s imminent loss of devolved powers.So, Farage is tactically right to bang on about democracy at every turn. Of course, he wouldn’t know itdemocracy smacked him in the face and he doesn’t specy solutions beyond Brexit lest he accidentally refocus English voters on the real, immediate dangers of their own ailing, archaic system. But he’s absolutely on the money. It’s democracy, stupid - precisely because the main UK parties will not modernise the British state. The final straw is the Tory decision to flout electoral convention and pretend the European poll isn’t even happening. Nigel is not the only insurgent newkid on the block. The Lib Dems made a recovery at the local elections and, the Greens also did well. Indeed, all the parties with a clear vision of the future have picked up support. In Scotland, where the SNP has unequivocally nailed its colours to the European mast, it’ll be interesting to seethe recent declaration of a climate emergency by Nicola Sturgeon helps her or the Scottish Greens. The surprising decision by the hitherto Labour-supporting Sunday Mail to back Patrick Harvie’s party may be early evidence of a profound realignment, though some Yes supporters think it’s just a ruse to split the independence vote. The awkward truth could be that voters are more impatient for change than governing parties north and south of the border.What a dference a month makes.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon snp remains focused on indyref2","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP remains focused on delivering a second independence referendum as the party steps up its campaign ahead of next week#s European elections.Speaking to the media this morning, the first minister said that a strong performance from the Nationalists at the May  poll would send “the strongest possible message that Scotland does not want Brexit”.The SNP leader added that legislation would be brought forward later this month as part of the intitial steps required to stage a possible IndyRef.But the Scottish Conservatives said it was time to deliver a “sensible Brexit”.Ms Sturgeon told MSPs last month that she wanted to stage a second referendum by Brexit takes place.: Sturgeon offers support to SNP MP at centre of bullying claim“My focus as SNP leader is firstly on winning the European elections next week because that’s how we send the strongest possible message that Scotland doesn’t want Brexit,” the first minister said in an interview today.“Then of course the legislation we’ll bring forward later this month in taking the steps to give people in Scotland a choice of independence later in this term of parliament.

It is the largest science education outreach provider in the UK, visiting schools all over Scotland with a programme of dferent shows and workshops for all ages, from infant classes right up to upper primary. This year the tour will visit over  schools in  Local Authority areas from Shetland to the Borders.The Shetland workshops began on Monday in Brae, with children from Lunnasting and Mossbank Primaries taking part too.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing. Otherwise it will be a drop in the Minch."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/barra-airport-1.jpg","title":"new flight bank to give barra community more","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCreating a bank of  flights between Barra and Glasgow which can be used by the community at busy times of the year has been welcomed by the chairman of Castlebay Community Council.Michael Galbraith said the announcement, made last in late April by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, was all about giving locals #more control# over the number of flights rather than having them dictated by Loganair.#If there is a wedding or an event like Barrathon then we could well need the extra flights and we can pass that request on to Loganair,# he added. #First of all it will go through the chairs of Castlebay and Northbay community councils and we will disseminate that request to the other members.

After a warm welcome at reception wemade our way to our Executive room on the hotel’s first floor. The room was extremely spacious with a huge bathroom – a welcome slate of fresh fruit and bouquet of flowers was a wonderful touch.Over a cup of tea we were able to see more guests arrive throughout the afternoon who were accessing the hotel’s popular apartments and it was a quick change before heading out for dinner at Malone Lodge’s Kne and Fork Grill and Deli. The hotel’s restaurant is beautully laid-out with burgundy leather banquettes and ornate glass cases containing antique cutlery. Our sitting was for .pm and already there was a buzz in the restaurant with both couples and families celebrating birthdays and other special occasions. Once settled we had a look over Malone Lodge’s All Day Menu, which is served both in the main restaurant and Macklin’s lounge. Light bites included soup of the day, classic Caesar salad, chicken wings and beetroot and goat’s cheese salad. My partner and I decided to start things off with two servings of the goat’s cheese, which was delicious – pearls of tangy goat’s cheese were perfectly dressed accompanied by a scattering of caramelised walnuts and leaves.We surveyed a mouth-watering menu but it was a dish of chicken and chorizo carbonara served with a wedge of garlic bread and rocket that won out, along with a fillet of salmon with cockles, carrots, celery and lemon persillade sauce. My salmon main was a plump fillet with crispy skin sat atop a mound of creamy mash, green beans, roasted parsnip and caullower. Across the table the pasta was hailed a success. Generous side portions of onion rings and sweet potato fries ensured we had no room for dessert, tea or coffee but opted for a drink in the lounge where we promptly sank into one of their luxurious Queen-sized armchairs and did something we hadn’t done in a while – relax.The hotel staff in Malone Lodge are at the top of their game when it comes to going above and beyond to ensure your stay is a memorable one. This was further demonstrated at a very busy breakfast service the next morning. Nothing was too much trouble as we were guided to bowls of fresh fruit, granola, juices and toast with the option on offer to opt for something cooked to order. Full Irish, porridge, scrambled eggs and homemade pancakes are there for the taking, but we opted for the muffin, bacon and avocado combination, which hit the spot along with pots of freshly brewed coffee and tea.Malone Lodge Hotel offers a first class experience from the minute you step into their reception, until, sadly, in our case, you check out and back to reality.The hotel is within walking distance of Queen’s University, Botanic Gardens and a host of other South Belfast attractions. We particularly enjoyed the café culture of the surrounding area. The hotel boasts its own private car park which is becoming something of a rarity these days and it’s a mre step out of the vehicle and in to the hotel.Malone Lodge offers the perfect stay to all and, for us, on this occasion, a memorable one.For more information visit Malone Lodge Hotel and Apartments at www.malonelodgebelfast or Tel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"carry your passport says man quizzed on belfast to dublin bus","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections EU Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After he was investigated over the shooting of the petrol bomber nothing happened.“In fact it was a pat on the back for what I had done.”Rioting had been ongoing since early on August , after the British army moved into republican areas across Northern Ireland to arrest IRA suspects after the introduction by the Stormont administration of the controversial policy of internment without trial.The incident was part of a three-day series of shootings from August - which has become known as the Ballymurphy Massacre."},{"url":null,"title":"mp urges better northsouth relations","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections EU Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But he called on all sides in the Brexit debate to \"rise above\" it and \"do better\". Speaking at Daniel OConnells graveside in Glasnevin Cemetery alongside Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, Mr Donaldson said the DUP did not see Brexit \"as a vehicle for creating a hard border on the island of Ireland\". He was representing the UK Parliament at an event honouring the Irish political heavyweight MP, who campaigned for Catholic emancipation and repeal of the Act of Union.\"Daniel OConnell was a parliamentarian who opposed the use of violence for political purposes,\" the MP said.\"In the aftermath of the murder of Lyra McKee, its appropriate to say that those who claim to be nationalist and republican and who use violence to further their political aims are not being true to the ideals promoted by people like Daniel OConnell, who believed that political violence was never justied.\"He said parts of the Good Friday Agreement had been left \"dormant\", including north-south relations. \"If you asked me  years ago which were the relationships most likely to flourish, I wouldnt have said the east-west relationship would have done better than the north-south relationship.

It is just as important to the future as electricity was then.— Richard BrutonMay , He added that “the state has a responsibility somewhat of the same sort, but part of the state’s cost is contingency which may not be called upon.“Theyhave responsibility under that contract to provide initial equity of course, and working capital equity, and also should there be any risks encountered,they find that projections aren’t fulfilled, they are entirely on the hook for injecting new cash into the business to sustain it.”The Government has come under sustained criticism in the week since announcing the plan, which they say is value for money despite the price being paid by taxpayers, and the fact the state will have no ownership of the project.Fianna Fail spokesperson on public expenditure and reform, Barry Cowen, has said that the Government’s continued refusal to disclose documents in relation to the input of Granahan McCourt is an affront to taxpayers.“Minister Donohoeis taking the people of Ireland for mugs with his insistence that no capital projects will be impacted as a result of the costs of the plan.”However, Mr Bruton remained steadfast on Monday, saying that the Government had reviewed every possible option for the delivery of the plan.My belief and the belief of Government is this is the best approach, the most cost-effective, and will deliver it quick as possible.Richard Bruton“This isn’t a leap of faith, there is a recognition that broadband is going to be crucial to participation in Irish society in the years ahead,” he said.“If we have . million people excluded from broadband, we’d be cutting off opportunities for huge swathes of our population, and that’s not acceptable.“In terms of the model, we’ve looked at every alternative, we examined all of these, they all would either not deliver on the ambition or deliver it at higher cost or impose y delays.“My belief and the belief of Government is this is the best approach, the most cost-effective, and will deliver it quick as possible.”Mr Bruton will appear before the Oireachtas joint committee on communications this week to discuss the process of selecting the rollout plan.“I’m going to committee this week to convince people that this is the best option and how we reached this decision,” he said.“We have analysed it in great depth and the ambition of including rural Ireland in broadband is an important goal.”Documentation released by the Government last week showed that Secretary General Robert Watt and his officials had strongly recommended against the Government appointing the preferred bidder on grounds of affordability, risk and value for money.The top civil servant in the Department of Public Expenditure warned that the plan poses great financial risk and called for the procurement process to be cancelled.A consortium led by Granahan McCourt was announced as the preferred bidder after Cabinet approval.It was the only remaining bidder for the contract to deliver high-speed broadband to more than , homes and businesses.The rollout of the scheme, which will bring fibre broadband to . million people across the country, will begin at the end of the year.It is expected to take seven years to complete."},{"url":null,"title":"former snp policy chief announces support for scottish greens","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections EU Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

will need to include a second referendum in order to receive the backing of Labour MPs, Sir Keir Starmer has said..pushThe shadow Brexit secretary warned it was “impossible” to see how an agreement between the Conservatives and Labour could clear the Commons unless it guaranteed the deal would be put back to the public for a “confirmatory vote”.Sir Keir made the comments ahead of crunch talks between Cabinet ministers and senior Labour figures on Monday, although speculation was growing over whether the negotiations will succeed.Speaking to , the leading Labour negotiator said his colleagues and the party leadership would have to decide “in the coming days”it was worth continuing with the talks.I’ve made it clear that at this stage, at this th hour, any deal that comes through from this government ought to be subject to the lock of a confirmatory voteSir Keir StarmerMeanwhile, The Times reported that the Prime Minister has been urged by Cabinet ministers to pull out of the talks and move to indicative votes by MPs.Chancellor Philip Hammond is said to be among those who have lost faith with the plan to strike a cross-party deal, while on Sunday Education Secretary Damian Hinds expressed support for finding a “stable majority” by allowing MPs to vote on dferent options.In the wake of dire local election results for the Tories and Labour and looming European elections – which could see Nigel Farage’s newcomer Brexit Party make unprecedented gains – both parties are under pressure to make progress on Britain’s EU departure.“I’ve made it clear that at this stage, at this th hour, any deal that comes through from this government ought to be subject to the lock of a confirmatory vote,” Sir Keir said.The shadow minister said that “probably not ” of the party’s  MPs could vote against the deal unless it was linked to a second referendum.“If the point of the exercise is to get a sustainable majority, over several weeks or months of delivering on the implementation, you can’t leave a confirmatory vote out of the package,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May is under pressure to make progress on Brexit Sir Keir signalled that Labour expects movement from the Government this week in order to keep the talks on track, telling the paper it “would be wrong in principle to use up much more time simply exploring each other’s positions”.“I do think we do probably in the coming days need to make that assessment.”The issue of a confirmatory referendum has been an internal battleground within Labour ranks, with Sir Keir pushing for one but shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, also part of the negotiating team, less keen.Sir Keir highlighted how the party lost  lost seats in this month’s council elections, which he said were a sign Labour was losing the trust of Remain as well as Leave voters.The party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, is expected to call for a second vote in a speech on Monday.Mr Watson will reportedly invoke the late Labour leader John Smith, saying the heavyweight would have backed a “people’s vote as a way out of this destructive mess”.The Sun says Mr Watson will tell the Fabian Society that Mr Smith, who was tipped to become prime minister before his death  years ago, saw “anti-EU sentiment” as “wrong-headed”.The BBC reported that Mr Watson will “plead” with voters to back Labour in next week’s European Parliament elections, despite the party’s Brexit stance.“There are only two forces that can win this election – that nasty nationalism of the Farage Brexit Party, or the tolerant, compassionate outward-looking patriotism of the Labour Party,” he will say.I think well get an absolute maulingHuw Merriman, Conservative politicianA ComRes general election poll published on the weekend found Mr Farage’s Brexit Party had overtaken the Tories for the first time, taking a one-point lead.That level of support would see the Brexit Party win  seats, becoming the UK’s second biggest party after Labour, with .Speaking to the BBC Radio  Westminster Hour on Sunday night, the Chancellor’s parliamentary aide, Huw Merriman, said the Tories will suffer “an absolute mauling” in next week’s European Parliament elections.“The public will blame the Conservative government because we were the party that brought forward the referendum,” said Mr Merriman, who backs a second referendum.“And so for those that didn’t want it and wanted Remain, they’ll blame us for having tried to take us out.“And for those that voted to leave, they’ll blame us for having not got the country out of the EU.“We’re at the perfect storm, so yes, I think we’ll get an absolute mauling.”"},{"url":null,"title":"benjamin mendy leads social media celebrations as city defend pl title","story":" Hi

Such a trail would link the arearsquos many tower houses, monasteries and other medieval sites. Local people are being invited to give their ideas on the trail and it might be enhanced through themed banquets, tapestry making, metal working, re-enactments, guided tours and other activities to encourage visitors to spend time in the area.This project is being supported and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Tourism NI and the Historic Environment Division of the Department for Communities. It has been developed as part of their European Year of Cultural Heritage programme.ldquoA medieval trail would leave a lasting legacy from the huge rise in visits to heritage sites used as Game Of Thrones locations, estimated by Tourism NI at , visitors in , and valued at pound million to the local economy, a spokesman for the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership said.ldquoThe Beyond Westeros Roadmap describes how political control was shared around  AD among  lordships of medieval Ulster and their stories played out around Dundrum Castle and other sites.ldquoThe project will also work with people, tour operators and tour guides, particularly in and around Downpatrick, to begin to establish medieval sites as cultural hubs within a network of linked sites.Iniduals, businesses, artisans and groups in Co Down will be invited to help develop medieval sites as cultural hubs for their community and for visitors.A portfolio of medieval stories and characters will be created to communicate to these cultural heritage tourists.This will enhance work already undertaken by Historic Environment Division to improve visitor access and community engagement with some sites in their care in the area, and they will be closely involved throughout the project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Armstrongs at Limerick  ","story":"SUNDAY saw Sean and Teresa Armstrong take part in the Great Limerick  Mile Run mdash made even more enjoyable by a beautul sunny day and a lively musical warm-up which saw runners entertaining the crowd by displaying some dodgy dance moves with the dance troupe on stage.Race four of the Hill and Dale series took Team Mac to Slieve Binian for the lsquorace to the toprsquo.This is only race of the series to finish on a mountain peak and Binian certainly doesnrsquot show any mercy to the competitors.A field of  lined up on the Head Road on a glorious evening, Binian was looking majestic in the evening sunshine, but no runner was admiring the view, competitors were all just looking in shock at the gradient that lay before them.Paul Byrne was race director and quickly gave the race briefing before giving the field a very abrupt start.A fast sprint up the lane towards the quarry with runners fighting for position before the steep incline up beside the wall.At the quarry the field slowed to a walk as legs began to burn climbing the , feet to the peak. The welcome sight of the stile at the wall brings relief to the faces of many as it means the finish is merely a  metres away.Some of the runners had to queue to get over, which was a welcome rest as they all prepared themselves for the last leg burn up the steepest finish of the series with the finish right at the peak.Hugh Oram was initially leading Team Mac up the wall when he was comfortably passed by Sean Armstrong, who greeted him as he passed and then disappeared into the distance.Sean finished in st in :, Hugh was six places behind him, then Colm Devlin, Laura Lynch, Dave Fulcher, Barry Poland with Regine Candau hot on his heels, finishing only six seconds behind.Liam Smyth was next, then Catherine Scannell, with Michael Power just behind.

I had great help from the Laird family in the earlier days until my own family got up and were fit to help.Felixrsquos antidote to hard work was finding time to relax and enjoy himself.ldquoI loved watching horse racing, football and snooker on the TV and often attended Downpatrick races in the earlier days, he said.The secret to his long le  ldquoI was blessed with the company of a loving family, friends and neighbours and I love to see the younger generations coming to visit, he said.Felix says he always advised his family and friends to be content with what they had and not to take le too seriously.ldquoI dealt with things as they happened, thatrsquos how I dealt with le, he continued. ldquoI feel very lucky to have reached this age as a lot of my friends and family have passed before me. I always leave a weeof tea in the bottom of my cup so maybe this has helped me live so long!Felix was born in Ballykinlar just weeks before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War, on June , .He was the fourth child of Felix and Ellen Burns and learnt the value of hard work from his parents. His father was a butcher, while his mother ran a small sweet shop and cafe and used to bake bread for the soldiers, particularly the GIs who were stationed at Ballykinlar army barracks during the Second World War.Felix was in his early twenties during the war. His youngest daughter, Anne, says the bombing of Belfast is something that stuck with him all his le.ldquoThe Blitz in Belfast is something that Daddy always talks about. He says he can remember that he and a friend climbed up to a top of a nearby hill to watch the bomber planes.

Horace soon began researching the effects of the Troubles on the RVH, and started collecting photos, videos and press clippings. The shoebox collection grew and eventually occupied two filing cabinets.He had intended to write a book on the subject, but sudden illness put an end to that intention. He subsequently made his Troubles archive available to other authors, such as the late Kate OrsquoHanlon, senior sister in RVH Casualty, Margaret Wilson and Moore Sinnerton.In June  he sustained a sudden onset of severe ME, which immediately ended his hospital career. He spent most of the next five years flat on his back in bed, with frequent migraines, insomnia, continual acute flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and weakness, weird new allergies, and a brain gone AWOL.On air on Sunday he compared ME to having a defective battery on a mobile phone. Instead of the battery operating for  hours a day, it reluctantly provides power for only two hours. And once flat, it takes a full day to recharge. Horace never thought it was a fatal condition. But it has the same ill effects as a killer disease mdash energy loss on such a scale suddenly deprives you of job, career, income, and social and family le.ME was first defined in  by a famous Ulster doctor, Sir Donald Acheson. In the  years since, the NHS has made very little progress in identying a cause, or developing a cure. So ME patients find it very dficult to access competent medical care. But they have no dficulty in encountering hostility, prejudice, and stigma.Horace received exemplary care from a small number of NHS doctors. But he experienced hostility, suspicion and a damaging lack of knowledge with some others. His eventual route to partial rehabilitation was provided, not by the NHS, but by the arts and media sectors in Belfast and Down District.Part of his initial five-year nightmare was that he couldnrsquot read much, or watch TV. By the time he got to the bottom of a page, he had forgotten what he had read at the top. Eventually he discovered thathe underlined relevant sentences in a book, he could then fix information in his memory.Triggered by the cover illustration on Jonathon Bardonrsquos first edition A History of Ulster, in  he had begun researching the  Rebellion and the associated fighting in his home town of Ballynahinch. He continued this exploration after illness hit in . By  mdash the Rebellion bicentenary mdash he had acquired a wide knowledge of th century politics, personalities, warfare and weapons.A number of NHS personnel seemed to doubt Horacersquos sanity and or integrity mdash an attitude they automatically extended to all ME patients. But other prominent iniduals, in equally august institutions, took an entirely dferent view. Horace had amassed a knowledge of the  period, and in  they all wanted to access it mdash Brian Turner from the Down Museum, Dr Desmond Bailie of the Presbyterian Historical Society, Moore Sinnerton at the BBC and Jane Leonard at the Ulster Museum.Post-ME Horace had signicant dficulty with reading and writing at any . So everyone was very patient with the small amounts and slow pace of his product. But eventually he produced a well-reviewed major article on the Battle of Ballynahinch, . And he gave a lively bicentennial lecture on Betsy Gray to a capacity audience at the Ulster Museum. A new career was launched, though on a much, much smaller scale than before the onset of illness.Horace has now developed a lecturing technique which overcomes his dficulty with the written word. His PowerPoints are really image-rich slide-shows, and he talks to what he sees in the pictures. Audiences remark that ldquohe can talk for an hour without notes, unaware that he continually faces the screen, and uses the images as visual prompts. They quite like the near-cinema experience.Recently Pamela Cooper, of the Lecale Historical Society, has further improved on his technique. She made a tran of his Five Montalto Dynasties lecture, and then turned it into a major printed article mdash his first in  years.Horace continues to have signicant ME disability, with the typical energy deficit, so for him local history is a vital form of occupational therapy. One of his reasons for going on radio was to thank all those down the decades who have given him an outlet for his hobby.These include the late Dr. Brum Henderson, of the Ballynahinch Murals Group Vincent Fullam, of Ballynahinch Regeneration Joanne Patterson, BBC, Your Place and Mine Martyn Todd, of Discover Saintfield: Dr Winston Shaw and the Presbyterian Historical Society Gordon Wilson and the late David Anderson at Montalto Estates Dr Eacuteamon Phoenix the Editors of the Mourne Observer and Down Recorder, on many occasions Dr. Terry Cross at Killaney Lodge Karen Patterson, of the Rowallane Slieve Croob Partnership and many Probus branches and local historical societies.Arthur Davidson, Derek Rowlinson, and Peter Rowan have always kept him supplied with rare books., as did Deirdre Armstrong when the SEELB Library Board Irish Special Collection was based in Ballynahinch. Recently, published authors have consulted him about the  period, such as Conor OrsquoClery, Ken Dawson and Guy Beiner.For Horace, outdoor recreation is almost a thing of the past. But MLA Jim Wells allows him on board his birdwatching boat trips on the north coast. By this means it is possible to enjoy unique access to glorious scenery at Carrick-a-Rede, Torr Head, Fair Head and Rathlin, all without getting out of your seat, or walking a yard.Guests on Sundayrsquos BBC programme were allowed to play one piece of music: Horace picked a paraphrase from the Scottish Psalter. During the worst period of his illness he was often unable to read, but he could always enjoy music. He steadily worked his way through the HMV Classical CD catalogue. And he also reverted to the music of his childhood ndash hymns he remembered from the Ballynahinch Methodists.Dr. William Drennan, founder of the United Irishmen, once worshipped at First Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch in . That was before the introduction of hymn-singing and church organs. Horacersquos own Scottish ancestors probably arrived around , and he imagined they would have used paraphrases in their services.This article is an amalgam of what Horace actually said on radio ndash and what he would have said given another half hour on microphone!

He was threatening to spoil the party after polling a particularly impressive  first preference votes.While not considered a threat by pundits, McMurray came just  votes short mdash after transfers mdash of causing a major shock.In the end, what was proving an uncomfortable evening and early morning for Sinn Fein sitting councillor Willie Clarke, who described the election campaign as the most intensive he had ever been involved in, and newcomer Leeanne McEvoy, ended in relieved smiles.As the duo waited for their election to be confirmed, Doran, who had been awake from .am, was nervously placing the floor, admitting to reporters he felt a ldquonervous wreck as what at times seemed a laborious election count continued.The smile on his face was unmissable when it was formally confirmed that his partners had been elected but, sadly, for the Sinn Fein duo, there was only a handful of party supporters in the election count centre to congratulate them as everyone  had gone home.Nonetheless, Doran, McEvoy and Clarke celebrated together, clearly recognising the signicance of the result for Republicans in an area once regarded as a unionist stronghold.The SDLPrsquos Laura Devlin, who was popping in and out of the count to keep an eye on her new baby Polly who is two months old, comfortably retained her seat with , votes but the election marked the end for her party colleague, Brian Quinn, who was eliminated after polling just  first preference votes.Given that he was so far behind, it was inevitable that Quinn, who was a member of the former Newry and Mourne Council, would lose his seat, although early on in the count it was not clear to whom. When the SDLP stalwart was formally eliminated from the contest he was consoled by his loyal party colleagues.As for DUP man Hanna, his canvass was hampered by the fact that  weeks ago he underwent hip replacement surgery, restricting his mobility. However, the voters came out in numbers helping him top the poll which he admitted he hadnrsquot expected.Elsewhere, there were resounding wins for the UUPrsquos Harold McKee mdash who is ing to the council chamber for a second time after losing his South Down Assembly seat in  when the number was reduced from six to five mdash and Independent Unionist Henry Reilly.The highly respected McKee is no stranger to elections and admitted that the most recent was his easiest to date. Given the absence of the Assembly he believes it is time more powers were handed to local councils to let them get on with the job of looking after their respective districts.McKee insists that local government is about delivering for people, highlighting the importance of all councillors working together for the benefit of their respective areas.Reilly, who fought his first election  years ago and along with McKee was elected on the second count, surprisingly admitted that he was worried going into this one as he did not have a party machine behind him. He described his election as ldquomost satisfying.While his vote dipped by over  from , Reilly explained that when he topped the poll five years ago as a member of UKIP, the party was spending tens of thousands of pounds on its EU election campaign and he was its Northern Ireland candidate.Afraid that his council vote could have collapsed by as much as , Reilly focused his election campaign solely on Kilkeel and Annalong which he described as his ldquoheartland also expressing concern that he was not allow to declare himself as an Independent Unionist on the ballot paper and that Alliance was running a strong candidate.As for McMurray, he insisted that he had no regrets switching to The Mournes as it ldquofelt the right thing to do and was pleased with his performance first time out in an area which was new to him.He used a football analogy to describe coming just  votes short of causing a major upset, adding: ldquoItrsquos like playing well away from home and losing -. A great game and great performance but you donrsquot get the three points.

It is a problem they need to solve with SDLP and Sinn Fein sources suggesting better engagement with these particular voters is needed.The SDLPrsquos share of the vote in the Downpatrick DEA has decreased from almost % five years ago to .% with Sinn Feinrsquos share decreasing slightly from .% in  to .%.By contrast, Independent candidate Cadogan Enright increased his vote by , comfortably passing the , mark for the first time.Pundits were suggesting that Enright could end up locked in a battle for the fth seat with the SDLPrsquos Trainor and there were audible gasps in the Newry count centre when it was officially confirmed that the Independent candidate had finished second behind Sharvin on first preference votes, immediately placing increasing pressure on those chasing the remaining three seats.Enrightrsquos increased vote, which did not come as a surprise to the man himself, is viewed as a reward for his hard work with community groups in Downpatrick and those dotted across Lecale where he is extremely active in village communities.And, just like in , many of these groups officially endorsed his candidacy and played a key role in an election canvass which saw a small army of workers trudge across the district on his behalf knocking doors and putting election material through letterboxes.Regarded as a politician who gets things done, Enright is a thorn in the side of the big two parties in Downpatrick who took time to digest his performance at last weekrsquos poll.Enright insists that analysis of the past four council elections in the Downpatrick DEA confirms that both the SDLP and Sinn Fein are losing favour with the people of Down and Lecale and that over the same period the unionist vote has remained steady at around seven percent.Aontuacutersquos Macartan Digney surprised many when he polled  votes and there are those who suggest that the well known candidate who is a member of the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella body for local community groups and residentsrsquo associations ndash may have taken votes off Enright whose first preference performance may have been even better.As for the SDLP, the party heaved a huge sigh of relief that its three runners, including the provincersquos longest serving councillor, Dermot Curran, made it home.All the party candidates had a fight on their hands with veteran Curran openly admitting that he was worried going into the election, describing it as his toughest to date. Sinn Fein clearly had the SDLP worried.Republicans fought an intense campaign as it always do and there was obvious disappointment that only Hanlon, contesting her first election, secured a seat, with Madden unable to join her.Hanlon, who works for South Down MLA Emma Rogan, ticks an important box for Sinn Fein as she lives and works in Downpatrick and is acutely aware of the key issues which she will be able to address at council level.Not having a councillor on the ground in the county town was an issue the party wanted to address at this election, but the hope of having two candidates evaporated as the Downpatrick count progressed and Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join his party colleagues in the chamber.Alliance, which did not field a candidate in , was delighted with the performance of student Tiernan Laird who polled  votes,  ahead of the UUPrsquos Alexander Burgess, who was the partyrsquos third choice to contest one of the five seats up for grabs in Downpatrick.The DUPrsquos James Savage increased the party vote by five, polling  first preferences, while the Green Partyrsquos Jamie Kennedy polled  votes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein now biggest party  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos chairman and vice-chairman were the high profile casualties of last weekrsquos local election.Following a marathon two-day count at Newry Leisure Centre, current SDLP chairman Mark Murnin lost out to his running mate Hugh Gallagher in Slieve Croob while his Sinn Fein deputy, Oksana McMahon, lost her seat in Crotlieve in an election of shocks and surprises.Overall, Sinn Fein emerged as the biggest party with  seats mdash up two from  mdash but it was a bad election for the SDLP which lost three of its most experienced councillors, Kate Loughran , Brian Quinnand Michael Carr . The party now has  seats.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown produced a stunning performance to top the poll in Rowallane, with another shock in Slieve Croob where Ulster Unionist Alan Lewis, who was contesting his first election, topped the poll.Sinn Feinrsquos bold strategy of running three candidates in The Mournes paid off, but the election also marked the rise of the Independents with stunning performances by Cadogan Enright , Jarlath Tinnelly, Mark Gibbonsand Gavin Malone in Newry.Sinn Fein went into the election with hopes of potentially taking up to  seats given the runaway success of South Down MP Chris Hazzard in the  Westminster poll when Republicans won a % share of the vote across the constituency.The party earmarked Downpatrick as a key battleground to secure two seats and had high hopes for Oonagh Hanlon and Jordan Madden, who were contesting their first elections. But it wasnrsquot to be with only Hanlon getting over the line as Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join her.A statement of intent by Republicans to secure three seats in The Mournes for the first time paid off with Sean Doran, Willie Clarke and Leeanne McEvoy elected, with the election of latter two confirmed shortly before am on Saturday.Sinn Fein were also bidding to secure three seats in Slieve Croob, but sitting councillor John Rice lost his seat, with Roisin Howell and Cathy Mason elected. Republicans were also disappointed at the loss of Ukrainian-born McMahon in Crotlieve amid suggestions by their political rivals that they had overstretched in this area.Despite McMahonrsquos loss, Gerry OrsquoHare and Mickey Ruane were elected in this DEA, while in Slieve Gullion it was almost a clean sweep with the party taking five of the seven available seats.The SDLP were mightily relieved to retain their three seats in Downpatrick with Gareth Sharvin topping the poll and joined by his colleagues Dermot Curran and John Trainor, the latter getting over the line thanks to UUP transfersBut the loss of council chairman Murnin to his party colleague, Hugh Gallagher, in Slieve Croob was a major blow for the party.The effervescent Terry Andrews secured his seat in Rowallane, but he missed out on topping the poll this time around and Laura Devlin was unable to take her running mate Brian Quinn over the line with her in The Mournes, much to the disappointment of the party. Quinnrsquos seat was one of a number Sinn Fein had targeted and successfully wrestled from the grasp of nationalists.Declan McAteer retained his seat in Crotlieve with former South Down MLA Karen McKevitt securing a seat. Pete Byrne recorded the third highest vote in Slieve Gullion but Loughran missed out despite polling , first preference votes.Alliance retained the two seats it held in Rowallane and Slieve Croob and came agonisingly close to pulling off a major shock in The Mournes where Andy McMurray, who had switched from Slieve Croob, came  votes short of denying Sinn Fein its hat-trick success.McMurray wasnrsquot given much of a chance as the party only polled  votes in , but he pulled in almost  first preferences as the Alliance surge across the Province had ripple effect across the district.Pundits had not predicted Brown topping the poll with some even suggesting that he could have been involved in a dogfight for the fth seat after the decision by Independent Martyn Todd to enter the fray. How wrong they were with him securing , first preference votes.Gregory Bain, who was defending the party seat in Slieve Croob, was ahead of Murnin by  first preference votes and this effectively kept the council chairman behind the eight ball for the remainder of the count. Newry candidate Helena Young also polled well in her first outing securing  first preferences. The UUP were cock-a-hoop that Lewis, contesting his first election, topped the poll with a stunning performance, more than doubling Dessie Pattersonrsquos vote in  to take his seat in the chamber alongside David Taylor , the ing Harold McKee in The Mournes and Rowallane stalwart Robert Burgess.But there was disappointment that Walter Lyons did not join Lyons in Rowallane, with party officials also pointing to the lsquoTodd factorrsquo which resulted in Burgess being unable to transfer as many votes as planned to his running mate.The DUPto the council with one seat less after Maynard Hanna failed to retain the Slieve Croob seat previously held by Garth Craig. Despite the disappointment, Glyn Hanna topped the poll in The Mournes for the first time mdash just weeks after hip replacement surgery, with Billy Walker and Harry Harvey retaining their seats in Rowallane where it is a case of as you were with the same five councillors ing to the council.Independent Unionist Henry Reilly, who topped the poll in The Mournes in , was delighted to retain his seat three decades after he fought his first election, describing his success as his ldquomost satisfying as he did not have a major party behind him, as was the case five years ago when he was a UKIP candidate.Aontuacute will be relatively pleased with its first election performance with its three candidates polling over , votes.

He could not have hidden his delighthe had wanted to.His win secured the seat for the UUP in an area where the DUP was previously the dominant unionist representative.Lewis said that he treated his canvass as a job interview and his message clearly resonated with voters. He believes there is a clear disconnect between residents and local government and aims to help repair the damage in his new role as a councillor.The UUP man, who was previously a member of UKIP and the TUV, says he intends to rebuild ldquotrust and confidence and maintains that politics is about ldquomaking an impact, not an income.Ballynahinch man Garth Craig polled , votes for the DUP in , but his decision to bow out of local politics prompted the party to select the experienced Maynard Hanna from the Mourne area to contest the seat.Hanna polled  votes but could not secure the transfers he needed with party sources suggesting that evenhad lived closer to Slieve Croob, it may not have been enough given the fact that UUP man Lewis has enjoyed a high profile over recent years.Sinn Fein invested much in their three Slieve Croob candidates and were hoping to get all three elected, but the vagaries of a PR election can often throw up unexpected results.The fact three Sinn Fein candidates captured over % of the votes was a signicant achievement, but sadly not enough to help sitting councillor Rice retain his seat.Roisin Howell, who was co-opted to replace Stephen Burns, produced a storming performance securing , votes but her colleague Cathy Mason, also contesting her first local government election, went even better, securing , votes.Both were understandably nervous as the count entered its final stages, with the exclusion of Rice paving the way for the two women to secure their seats, much to the delight of the Sinn Fein contingent following what a y campaign.Party officials have high hopes for the two women who intend to focus on a number of key issues including tourism and community, in particular, much-needed facilities for families across Slieve Croob.Their election further increases the number of women in the chamber with Sinn Fein delighted at the impact this will have moving forward.As for Alliance, Bain said he will be focusing on mental health issues.

Niall Johnson used his speed to torture the St Michaelrsquos defence as he left his marker in his wake and bore down on goal in the first minute only to see his shot saved by Gavin Marsden.St Michaelrsquos were lively in the opening minutes and they opened the scoring in the fth minute with a m free from the dangerous Joe McIlduff, who was deadly from the frees throughout the game and St Paulrsquos had to limit the fouls they conceded due to his accuracy.St Paulrsquos opened their account with a left-footed free from man of the match Fintan Eastwood from m and St Michaelrsquos hit back with a handy free from Conor OrsquoNeill.Seaacuten Tucker then tagged on a trio of points to help the Holywood men pull away from their west Down opponents.St Michaelrsquos, though, struck back with their first score from Brian Morgan. Fintan Eastwood added his second score of the game after great work from Daacuteire Rooney in midfield.St Michaelrsquos came back at Holywood and some great work left Morgan free to slot the ball over the bar, but a terric block by St Paulrsquos defender Jonny Parsons prevented the score.St Paulrsquos gathered possession and transitioned the ball up to Niall Johnson, who again left his marker for dead and bore down on the St Michaelrsquos goal before passing to Seaacuten Tucker.However, he was fouled to stop him scoring a goal, but Eastwood tapped over the resulting free from m. Eastwood added his fourth point of a fantastic game for him after great work by Conleth Rooney to set him up.Tucker added a m free before the first goal of the game. Daacuteire Rooney won the resulting kick out and ran m at speed into heart of the St Michaelrsquos defence before passing the ball to Tucker.He danced past two defenders before slotting the ball past Gavin Marsden in the St Michaelrsquos net. Further points from Eastwood, Niall Johnson and a Tucker free left the score at half-time a lopsided - to -.St Michaelrsquos again came out strongly in the second half and dominated play for the first five minutes with John Kearney scoring from play and McIlduff adding another free.St Paulrsquos finally came out for the second half when Daacuteire Rooney ran at the St Michaelrsquos defence before slotting over a terric point from m. Not to be outdone, the industrious Ben Gray took himself on a similar run and had the same result as he slotted over a point.St Paulrsquos were forced into an early substitution in the second half with Daniel Eastwood, ing from Australia, replacing Rooney, who pulled up with a hamstring injury.Danielrsquos brother, Fintan, added to his score collection with another point before Rooney scored the best point of the game. The Lisburn Distillery soccer star won the ball in midfield before taking off on a m lung-bursting sprint with the ball before a neat one-two with Daniel Eastwood provided him the space to slot the ball over from m, much to the delight of the St Paulrsquos supporters.Daniel Eastwood then took centre stage proving what a great asset he is going to be for St Paulrsquos going forward as he scored the next three points all from play.Last seasonrsquos player of the year Daacuteire McGrattan came off the bench for Daacuteire Rooney showing the depth St Paulrsquos now have in the  and he quickly made his mark.After a St Michaelrsquos player was rightly yellow carded for a rash sliding tackle, St Paulrsquos took the free kick quickly and a marauding McGrattan took the ball at high speed and fought off the challenges before smashing it into the top corner of the St Michaelrsquos net. McIlduff continued to punish St Paulrsquos indiscretions by scoring five frees in the second half, but St Paulrsquos were too strong and Fintan Eastwood added to his man of the match performance with his seventh point of the game.Seaacuten Tucker rounded off the scoring with the last score of the game. A convincing win for the Holywood men, but in truth there were multiple chances for goals that were not taken and in the stronger tests to come, the St Paulrsquos lads are going to have to be much more clinical in taking those goal chances.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Johnny Parsons, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Ben Gray , Daacuteire Rooney , Gerard Walls, Fintan Eastwood , Seaacuten Tucker , Martin Cox, Oliver Monaghan, Conleth Rooney, Niall Johnston .

If in Scotland they have gone in that direction, the Republic, England, you can understand that there’ll be a lot of pressure on Northern Ireland.“But so far, we give praise to God that Northern Ireland has not yielded to the pressures around her.”Rev Okikiolu said that not only has the general culture become more liberal, but “we see strains like that happening in religion”.His very conservative stance is not unusual in the Church of Nigeria, into which he was ordained.But it puts him very starkly at odds with many clergy in the Church of Ireland – part of the same Anglican communion – who in recent years have come out strongly in support of things like gay marriage.For example the global Anglican conference of  in Lambeth is the subject of a boycott, backed by – among others – archbishop of Nigeria Nicholas Okoh, due to what he saw as an increasingly permissive stance on homosexuality. By contrast Irish archbishop Richard Clarke has not struck such a tone on gay issues for instance in December he attended an event in his own Armagh diocese aimed at fostering support for “LGBTQ+ children”.NI karate expert Oliver Brunton still going strong as he approaches  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Whilst he hailed “the Gospel that has been brought to us by faithful Christians from the West”, he is sad to see now “people here in the West losing that same faith – that is disturbing”.“People are tending to compromise the Gospel. It makes me more concerned that it does not happen in Nigeria,” he said.He also spoke about sharing the news of the Ashers case with his friends back home.“Many people in Nigeria just think it is crazy,” he said.“How could anybody be subjected against his will “You talk about human rights in a civilised country, and then you find yourself in a situation whereby you don’t have a right to free religion or to exercise your mind, your decision, in a case like that.“They were surprised and shocked. Because that would not happen in my country. “When eventually there was victory, everybody was happy.”Rev Okikiolu was speaking as global oppression of Christians becomes a hot topic.The start of the year saw the commissioning of a review into worldwide Christian oppression by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.So does Rev Okikiolu see NI Christiansas persecuted He highlighted the group Boko Haram which has carried out attacks against Christians in north Nigeria.“We still have physical persecution of Christians.“But in Northern Ireland there is nothing like that. Rather,you look at the Ashers bakery case and all other things, it’d be more in a dferent way. When you talk about persecution here in the West, maybe not physical perseuction, but persecution comes in so many ways.“People suffer for their faith here in the West. But they’re encouraged to keep going.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquo This is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Itrsquos most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had design has been chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In itrsquos  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.At A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

years in the business  ","story":"Edward Wilson CBE, Chairman of Ulster Carpets, has retired after over half a century at the leading luxury carpet manufacturer. Known for his diplomacy, patience and people skills, Edward – who is the son of company founder George Walter Wilson – steps down after  years, having played a pivotal role in making Ulster Carpets one of the province’s leading exporters and the largest single site producer of axminster and wilton carpet in the world. While he grew up around the business, Edward followed in the footsteps of his older brothers, Walter and John, and officially joined Ulster Carpets in . In the intervening years, he held many positions, including in sales and planning, before becoming Managing Director and then, eventually, Chairman. Recognised as an astute leader, he was well known for taking a daily tour of the business where he spoke to staff at every level and kept up-to-date on the latest orders and technological developments. Many of the current management team were personally mentored by Edward, including Group Managing Director  Deputy Chairman, Nick Coburn. Edward commented: “One of my greatest pleasures in le has been going into the factory and talking to our staff. As I have been reminded so many times, one of the biggest selling points of Ulster Carpets is our wonderful workforce – people who are passionate about what they do. “When my father started Ulster Carpets in , I’m sure he never thought that the company would still be here over  years later, employing people not just in Northern Ireland but across the world. For that success, I must pay tribute to our wonderful staff and that is something I take great pride in.” Despite this retirement, the Wilson family will remain at the helm of Ulster Carpets, with Edward’s nephews, Nick Coburn and John Wilson, as Group Managing Director and Chairman respectively. Paying tribute to Edward’s passion and devotion to Ulster Carpets, Nick Coburn said: “When I joined the company  years ago, it was Edward who mentored and guided me through every facet of our business. Since I became MD in , this bond and incredible support from Edward has been vital to ensuring the company has continued to prosper and develop. “As we look to the future, I would also like to highlight the outstanding work and dedication Edward has done to prepare the company - and the next generation of the Wilson family - for a secure and successful future.” John Wilson, who takes over as Chairman, added: “Edward is held in the highest esteem by the company, the industry and, of course, the whole Wilson family. Edward’s commitment to seeing the company evolve and constantly adapt to the inevitable challenges that comes with  years of business is one of the reasons why Ulster Carpets is such a great company and has been so successful. “His decision to step down from his role as Chairman is another challenge for the business but he leaves the company in a strong place.” Following his last meetings with shareholders and board members, Edward’s final act was an official event at the company’s Castleisland factory where staff had an opportunity to say a final farewell.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up.

There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
