Over the course of a number of weeks, these messages will be delivered to the sky by two fleets of five planes. Founded by the interdisciplinary artists Cassils and rafa esparza, In Plain Sight is as ambitious in its scale as it is in its intention: working towards the abolition of immigrant detention and the US culture of incarceration.“I was shocked to learn that there are over 50,000 people in detention at any given moment, and that this is a for-profit industry,” says Cassils, who is Canadian but lives in Los Angeles. “This is a humanitarian crisis. And it’s hiding in plain sight, thus the title. The idea is to really use the skywriting as a way of piercing through electoral politics, to focus on the fact that this is not a partisan issue.”There’s poetry to the skyward messages of In Plain Sight. It is literally visible, perhaps through windows of detention facilities, by the people whose liberation the action works towards. But it also recalls both the patriotic messages and “red, white and blue” smoke plumes that are daubed across the sky on 4 July.Delivered by a method usually used to advertise car sales or insurance, In Plain Sight brings to mind the work of other artists who have harnessed the language of advertising, but does so in a uniquely 21st century fashion it’s not just a shareable, photogenic action, but one that has an “impact team” – led by the organiser, Set Hernandez Rongkilyo – working to ensure the message lingers. In this way, the artists behind In Plain Sight hope to push the viewer’s experience of the artwork beyond contemplation and into direct action.“Oftentimes this speculative space that exists between an artwork and its reception by the viewer is filled with the hope that something generative is experienced by the viewer,” esparza explains, saying the artists wanted to “make something that can be of service to organisations that have been seeking justice for immigrant folks in detention for decades”.Sky-typing may appear, upon first glance, to be an ephemeral mode of performance (albeit one that can reach around 3 million people with each message), but the work will live on via the free Augmented Reality app 4th Wall: users will be able to see the messages floating in the sky above key locations they visit. The hashtag #XMAP directs viewers to the accompanying website, xmap.us, allowing viewers intrigued by the heavenly messages to see, via geolocation, the detention facilities in their town. They will also be able to donate to local bond funds and engage with the 17 immigrant justice organisations involved – such as ACLU Southern California, RAICES, and Freedom for Immigrants – and their work being done on the ground.The coalition of activists and artists involved is nearly as jaw dropping as the scale of the work, including former minister of culture for the Black Panther party, Emory Douglas, the Cree artist Kent Monkman, the conceptual artist Mary Kelly, the writer and performance artist ALOK Vaid-Menon and the revolutionary artist Dread Scott.The Aboriginal Australian cross-disciplinary artist and writer SJ Norman contributed the message “NO SUCH PLACE” (the literal meaning of “utopia”), which appeared over the Laredo detention center in Texas. “When Indigenous peoples speak the names of our nations we are frequently told, implicitly or explicitly, there’s no such place,” Norman said in the artist’s statement. “The maintenance of the colonial project is contingent on atrocity and the perpetration of atrocity is largely contingent on denial. Settlers live with the ancestrally coded fear of losing what they know they stole in the first place.”Indeed, many Australians who shared the In Plain Sight images on social media were quick to note Australia’s significant rates of Aboriginal deaths in custody, incarceration and immigration detention – such as the former Manus Island detainees now being held in Melbourne’s Mantra Hotel – and how the inhumanity of such policies is magnified by the Covid-19 crisis.The final fleets of planes will head to the skies in the coming weeks. Above the Statue of Liberty, where Emma Lazarus’s inscribed sonnet – “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free” – came to symbolise the hopefulness of immigration to the US, Dread Scott’s message will float in the sky. It will read “Carlos Ernesto Escobar Mejia”, the name of the first immigrant to die in US detention from Covid-19.• In Plain Sight will continue in July, weather permitting.

No cases have been detected in a returned travellers in hotel quarantine. There are now 772 active cases in Victoria, and 438 cases that may indicate community transmission has occurred. There are 35 people in hospital, including nine in intensive care.Of the total cases since the virus emerged in the state, 2,469 cases are from metropolitan Melbourne, while 261 are from regional Victoria.Of the cases announced on Tuesday, 13 are linked to outbreaks in the North Melbourne and Flemington public housing towers, with the total number of cases from those buildings now 69. Twelve of the new cases are linked to the Al-Taqwa college outbreak, with that total now at 90. Four new cases have been linked to the Northern hospital in Epping, with the total now nine from that cluster made up of eight health staff and one household contact of a staff member.A new case has also been confirmed in a staff member at the Assisi aged care facility in Rosanna. The staff member did not work while infectious. Widespread testing of staff and residents will begin on Tuesday.Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said there were about 5,000 close contacts being monitored by health officials at this stage. Andrews said Victoria was on the cusp of a second wave.“We have to be realistic about the circumstances that we confront,” he said. “We have to be clear with each other that this is not over. And pretending that it is because we all want it to be over is not the answer. It is indeed part of the problem. A very big part of the problem.”Under the reinforced restrictions, people will not be able to stay in their holiday homes (Victoria is in the middle of school holidays), but for those who have already gone on holiday, they will be allowed to complete their holiday then return home.People would also not be permitted to exercise outside their area, Andrews said, if it was for daily exercise – not long hikes.Residents will no longer be able to have any visitors in their home, save for those with whom they are in an intimate relationship, and outside gatherings can be of no more than two people save for those who live in the same household.The detention order on the nine towers in Flemington and Kensington will be lifted once the residents have been tested and the chief health officer gives the all clear. After that the towers will be subject to the same restrictions as the rest of the Melbourne metro area.“This is not going to last a moment longer than it needs to, to keep those residents safe and to have what I know are very, very challenging measures,” Andrews said. “But they are proportionate to the risk when you consider, as we’ve said many times, the fact that so many people in those nine towers are among some of the most vulnerable people in our Victorian community.”The premier said the government was still considering how to treat those who test positive, and if they might be moved out of the towers at some later point.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has agreed to provide an extra 260 Australian defence force personnel to Victoria to assist the police in setting up road checks around the metropolitan edges of Melbourne. Andrews said not every car would be checked but police would use licence plate recognition technology to check cars leaving the area.Years 11 and 12 will return to schools next week, along with specialist schools. The school holidays have been extended for everyone else for one more week, and Andrews said more announcements on the return to school would be announced down the track.For essential workers, Andrews said, special school holiday programs would be extended. On regional areas, Andrews said he was planning to announce a further easing of restrictions due to the lack of cases in those areas.He said the six-week period was to give the virus three lifecycles. “If you are starting to see stability in low numbers, we’d have much greater confidence those are real numbers, rather than a false sense that the virus was not there any more or at such low levels that a suppression strategy would be able to work.”Meanwhile, the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said 650 police were on their way to the border crossings to Victoria as the border is closed from midnight to prevent virus spread into the state. There is confusion, because the process to apply for exemptions to the travel ban has not been finalised. While people who wrongfully attempt to cross the border will be fined, the official public health orders have not been announced.“We envisage the health orders will be ready sometime later this afternoon,” Fuller said. “Services New South Wales has been working overnight to have the technical solution in place so that people can start to apply for exemptions early this evening.“We’ll put out warnings once that information is up on the New South Wales government website. If there is a failure in any of the technology between now and midnight Tuesday night, and you need to cross the border, you will need to be patient.“But you should approach police and explain the situation and we’ll work with you.”The NSW police minister, David Elliott, suggested that Victoria should pay for the border arrangements. Andrews responded that he didn’t know Elliott, and he dealt with the NSW premier, not her ministers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/873c9ea9ce2ecb89403f7f14f9df5170886821ee/0_280_4777_2868/master/4777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e09c0c1d94d75570ed08d7d3deb1407a","title":"lifting of lockdown in england how do you feel reopening has gone","story":"We would like to hear from business owners and people who have visited pubs and restaurants to tell us how reopening has been Pubs, restaurants and hairdressers in England are some of the businesses that  were able to reopen from 4 July.

Once the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union, trade with the bloc, the UK’s largest export market, will become more difficult, even if the two sides reach a deal. The commission said failure to reach a deal is “an important risk” that would be “particularly negative for the UK”.So far, the impact of the coronavirus downturn on employment has been less bad than some feared, which the commission attributes to short-time work schemes that have kept people in their jobs on reduced hours, a policy stance it contrasted with the US, where unemployment claims have surged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f1c16f2b0f336875251755903787732feebda1/0_138_5464_3280/master/5464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d7f4b527bf4d1abcd70ec32b8b7cd2a","title":"china stock market high uk house prices covid 19 ftse business live","story":"Emilie Stevens, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, points out that Whitbread will suffer from a lack of overseas tourists this summer: With the foreign holiday market still rebooting it looks like UK staycations could be the main holiday choice this summer, which is good news for Whitbread’s regional locations.Before the pandemic London hotels were the boost and regional destinations the drag. But early booking data shows that regional tourist locations are seeing good demand while London remains subdued. Unfortunately, while higher levels of domestic tourism is good news, particularly if it’s a trend that holds, it’s no substitute for international and businesses travellers visiting the UK’s major cities. For now though it’s a welcome break in an unfriendly market environment.Here’s the full story:Former stock market darling boohoo is having another rough day, after revelations that its Leicester-based suppliers have been paying workers below the minimum wage and ignoring Covid-19 guidelines.Boohoo said on Monday it was investigating claims that staff at one of its Leicester factories were paid as little as £3.50 an hour and were working without proper equipment to guard against Covid-19.The firm, which owns the Nasty Gal and Pretty Little Thing brands, said it would not hesitate to terminate its relationship with any suppliers that were found in breach of its code of conduct.But the case has ignited broader concerns about working conditions in hundreds of small warehouse factories in Leicester’s garment industry, which supplies high street fashion brands.European stock markets have fallen deeper into the red, after the EC warned that the Covid-19 slump will be even worse than feared.With a new Covid-19 lockdown underway in Melbourne, investors will be fretting about a second-wave of infections hitting Europe.Marios Hadjikyriacos of trading firm XM explains:Spearheading the worrisome virus news globally, Australia’s second most populous city – Melbourne – just announced a new full-fledged lockdown for six weeks to bring the recent outbreak back under control. The news sent the aussie tumbling, exacerbating the currency’s earlier troubles after the RBA struck a rather cautious tone at its meeting overnight.This may be the biggest factor weighing on risk assets today in general, serving as a stark reminder that even if a country contains the pandemic successfully, future outbreaks still cannot be ruled out.Britain is also facing an even deeper recession than previously thought.The EC includes the UK in its new Summer Forecasts, even though Brexit took place back in January.GDP is forecast to fall substantially in the second quarter of 2020. The lockdown has led to a sharp slowdown in business activity in many sectors, particularly the hospitality sector, construction, and arts and entertainment. Private consumption and business investment are also projected to fall significantly. In the second half of 2020, private consumption and business investment are forecast to rebound, supported by the further easing of the lockdown, an expansionary fiscal stance and supportive monetary policy.Business investment, however, is expected to catch up more gradually, due to pressure on balance sheets as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the continued uncertainty about future of EU-UK trading relations. Net exports are expected to negatively contribute to growth, while government consumption is expected to make a positive contribution. The EC also warns that Europe could easily suffer an even worse recession than it currently fears.The risks to today’s forecast are “exceptionally high and mainly to the downside” it says. That’s partly due to the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 cases trade wars are another danger, though.The scale and duration of the pandemic, and of possibly necessary future lockdown measures, remain essentially unknown. The forecast assumes that lockdown measures will continue to ease and there will not be a ‘second wave’ of infections. There are considerable risks that the labour market could suffer more long-term scars than expected and that liquidity difficulties could turn into solvency problems for many companies. There are risks to the stability of financial markets and a danger that Member States may fail to sufficiently coordinate national policy responses.A failure to secure an agreement on the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU could also result in lower growth, particularly for the UK. More broadly, protectionist policies and an excessive turning away from global production chains could also negatively affect trade and the global economy.There are also upside risks, such as an early availability of a vaccine against the coronavirus.Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for the Economy, is concerned that the pandemic will increase economic inequality in Europe.“Coronavirus has now claimed the lives of more than half a million people worldwide, a number still rising by the day - in some parts of the world at an alarming rate. And this forecast shows the devastating economic effects of that pandemic. The policy response across Europe has helped to cushion the blow for our citizens, yet this remains a story of increasing ergence, inequality and insecurity.This is why it is so important to reach a swift agreement on the recovery plan proposed by the Commission – to inject both new confidence and new financing into our economies at this critical time.”France, Spain, and Italy are all facing desperately deep recessions this year, the EC believes, while Germany will be less badly hit.Newsflash: the European Commission has slashed its economic forecasts, warning that eurozone will suffer an even deeper recession than previously thought.That’s because the Covid-19 pandemic has caused even more economic damage than initially thought, as countries struggle to emerge from lockdown.In a new set of forecasts, the EC warns that:Because the lifting of lockdown measures is proceeding at a more gradual pace than assumed in our Spring Forecast, the impact on economic activity in 2020 will be more significant than anticipated. The Commission also warns of ‘exceptionally high’ downside risks, due to the dangers that some companies collapse, driving unemployment higher. It is urging national leaders to back a major stimulus programme to revitalise its economy, when they meet for a crunch summit later this month.Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that works for People, says:“The economic impact of the lockdown is more severe than we initially expected. We continue to navigate in stormy waters and face many risks, including another major wave of infections.If anything, this forecast is a powerful illustration of why we need a deal on our ambitious recovery package, NextGenerationEU, to help the economy.Looking forward to this year and next, we can expect a rebound but we will need to be vigilant about the differing pace of the recovery. We need to continue protecting workers and companies and coordinate our policies closely at EU level to ensure we emerge stronger and united.” Here’s some snap reaction:Just in: UK house price fell in June for the fourth month in a row, as the coronavirus downturn hit demand. “The near-term outlook points to a continuation of the recent modest downward trend in prices through the third quarter of the year.”The housing market went into a temporary deep freeze under the lockdown, with estate agents, surveyors and potential buyers all banned from entering homes.There are now signs that the market is heating up -- Halifax reports that mortgage enquiries surged in June, with twice as many as in May.The grim total of UK job losses since the Covid-19 pandemic began continues to rise - with media group Reach cutting hundreds of positions.The company, which also owns hundreds of regional papers including the Manchester Evening News, Birmingham Mail and Liverpool Echo, said more people had been reading its products online over the past three months, but this was not enough to offset the loss in income.Whitbread told shareholders this morning that the reopening of its Premier Inn hotels and restaurants is “fully underway”, but added that demand is ‘subdued’ in some areas.It is still very early days and therefore too early to draw any conclusions from our booking trajectory, especially as there has been volatility in hotel performance in other countries that relaxed controls before the UK. However, in traditional regional tourist destinations, we are seeing good demand for the summer months, whilst the rest of the regions and metropolitan areas, including London, remain subdued. The boom in China’s stock market hasn’t filtered round to Europe today.The news that Melbourne is imposing a new six-week lockdown, after suffering a spike in Covid-19 cases, may be weighing on the City.David Madden of CMC Markets says the markets are calmer after Monday’s rally.Stocks in mainland China built on yesterday’s gains, but the upward move was more measured today. The Hong Kong market has handed back most of its earlier gains and it is now just about up on the session.We also have signs that Europe’s economy has turned the corner, but faces a long journey back to normality.Interestingly, Chinese media are taking a rather calm tone today, reminding investors to be rational and mindful of potential risks.That might pour some cold water on hopes of making a quick fortune in the stock market.....The surge in Chinese stocks has also reminded IG’s Salaheddine Bouhmidi of the 2015 bubble.... Bloomberg has spotted that searches for ‘how to open a stock account’ surged on social media in China on Monday, after the Securities Journal urged readers to join the ‘healthy bull market’.With shares rallying so hard this month , traders must be worried about missing out....The Financial Times’s China editor, James Kynge, reckons small investors should beware the recent leap in Chinese stocks, writing:Stock price surges that are not accompanied by climbing industrial profits can end in tears. He points to signs that investors are borrowing money to buy stocks (a common cause of stock market bubbles, as we saw in 1929...)The outstanding margin debt — incurred when investors borrow to buy stock — on China’s exchanges has risen to Rmb1.16tn ($164bn), the highest level since January 2016. Surging margin finance was also a hallmark of the early 2015 rally.But keen to take a victory lap for becoming the first large economy to recover from Covid-19, China’s state-run media was seeking to bask in the stock market’s feel-good glow. “Hahahahaha!” said a story in the Shanghai Securities News on Friday. “The signs of a bull market are more and more clear.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Is a stock market bubble building in China? After days of dramatic surges on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, stocks are now back at their highest levels since the notorious 2015 crash.The rally appears to be driven by Beijing policymakers rather than simply by solid economic fundamentals. Several state-controlled media outlets have been urging the populace to buy equities, to share in China’s economic recovery.Yesterday, a front-page editorial in the state-run China Securities Journal declared boldly that investors cold look forward to “the wealth effect of the capital markets”, thanks to the “healthy bull market” now building. China’s army of day traders have taken such talk seriously, piling back into stocks. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA explains:Retail investors dominate China’s equity turnover on the Mainland. With a closed capital account, and the Government managing most other investment avenues, China’s savings surplus can really only flow into real estate or equities. It is thus, not a difficult challenge to mobilise the masses, by extolling them to “fill their boots” with equities.The implication being, that if state media is telling them to, there is an implicit “letter of comfort,” that the Government has their back. Much like the Federal Reserve is ostensibly doing these days, albeit in a less subtle manner.But is it safe? Older heads can remember the turmoil of 2015, when a previous Chinese stock market boom ended in tears.Bloomberg reports that some investors are urging caution:Wang Hongyuan, the co-chairman of First Seafront Fund Administration Co., warned buyers need to be cautious.China’s equities have “the strongest fundamentals in the world” but the bubbles in some areas of the sector “are unseen in five years and the dangers are large,” he reported in penned feedback shared with Bloomberg. But....recent economic data from China has been encouraging -- with services companies posting their fastest growth in a decade. So there are solid reasons to buy shares too.Dai Ming, Shanghai-based fund manager at Hengsheng Asset Management, reckons that it’s different this time....“The market isn’t flooded with money everywhere like last time. Beijing is still very prudent with its monetary policy.” Wall Street had a strong Monday too, with the Nasdaq hitting yet another record high as money surges into tech stocks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eff6046478bb6b9bcf48ab623651bb00fb651a69/0_290_4928_2958/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c95011819e56357d8cde0f8bcb04edd","title":"britain universities teaching timetables coronavirus","story":"The fiendish complexity of organising teaching and timetables in the context of coronavirus will push the sector to the brinkImagine a cross between a jigsaw and a chessboard, and now imagine playing games on it in 11 dimensions – including time. As universities limber up for probably their most difficult challenge since the second world war, that’s what higher education management feels like right now.Universities are experiencing countervailing pressures. The first emanates from students and parents, and especially from the regulator, the Office for Students: get as many students back into interactive teaching as quickly as possible.The return of students to universities is especially important for the financially weaker higher education institutions, because they desperately need the cash from first year undergraduates who can be encouraged on to campus, rather than defer their entry for a year or two.But pulling in the opposite direction there are fears about safety. Although one must take the science and sociology around a disease as new as Covid-19 with something of a pinch of salt, there are enough studies around to cause deep concern about the spread of the disease once teaching resumes in the autumn.The questions are manifold, and universities face more dilemmas than anyone can really list. Should older staff be kept away from campus? What pre-existing conditions should exclude staff from the classroom? How many vulnerable family members should be included in lecturers’ risk assessments?Then there’s the timetable. Imagine a “normal” undergraduate class. Perhaps there’s a lecture and then a couple of classes: 40 students ided into two seminar groups of 20 over three contact hours. But with social distancing that could become four classes of 10, plus the lecture.In recent years, an emergent and exploited precariat of associate lecturers (often PhD students or post-doctoral researchers) has emerged to fill the gaps. Given the financial crunch that’s now hitting, that option is mostly closed off. Shrinking numbers of permanent faculty must front the shop alone.But if we return to our imaginary “normal” module, that could involve a single five-hour stint that will not only break the lecturer, but could bust the timetable if it runs across into other slots. Fine: you can put two of those classes together online and rotate groups of students through face-to-face and web-based learning. But that only takes an hour off: back to a four-hour block, with three hours of in-person teaching. That’s still a budget-busting pressure on time and square footage universities don’t have.Then assume that some students don’t want to come on to campus at all. Perhaps they’re shielding, or their relatives are. Maybe there’s five or six of them, so we’re back to a four- or five-hour block within an online-only session at another time during the week. Maybe that doesn’t sound too bad, but now do all that three times for each lecturer – and multiply that challenge by 15 to 40 across a department.The timetabling office might well not know which students should go where. The module leader could know – though many students only intermittently check the legacy format of official email – but has no way of seeing the whole timetable. Confusion will abound.Now imagine the room survey that runs alongside those changes. Most universities own or lease all sorts of accommodation. They have to look at every single room not just for size but ventilation and entrances and exits, too. Narrow corridors, sealed windows and tiny cubby holes abound. Lecturers could end up running across and between campuses, on to buses full of students, driving around cities with their colleagues. How do you assess the safety elements involved?Someone has to do all the timetabling, room assessments, class rosters, new reading lists and tech upgrades. It is involved, time-consuming, multi-dimensional work that cannot be rushed.OK, you may be tempted to break out one of the smallest violins in the world. Of course, hundreds of thousands of people are about to lose their jobs (some university staff will too). No one in higher education minds a bit of hard work – as they have shown, year in, year out, driving one of the British economy’s biggest-earning success stories.It’s not the effort that’s the point. It’s the potential for these complex plans not to fit one with the other, a situation exacerbated by the fact that universities have been thinly stretched, like the NHS, for far too many years.Acknowledging the burden of complexity is actually a frank acceptance of where we’ve got to. Just as students of governance far too often forget the human factor, the unseen intellectual, physical and even spiritual energy required to run things is going to exact a high price on staff.The worst-of-both-worlds Balkanisation of British higher education – especially in England – is the real culprit here. Neither fully marketised nor fully planned, universities will be hit by the rising demands of students and parents who are both modern consumers looking for value for money and traditional strivers who rightly want to attend, want to learn, want to experience a “real” education.Their £9,000-plus tuition fees will be going into timetabling, hasty room realignment, meticulous module redesign, scanning and ebooks, software purchases, huge explosions in contact hours per member of staff. The students will rightly say: Why all the fuss? I can’t see what I’m getting.Britain’s universities increasingly look like the late Soviet economy, running down their social capital behind a glitzy screen of Potemkin imagery and glasnost-era statistics. Bits of it are locking up, alternately insulted and goaded by the gap between central government diktat and the reality on the ground. The result will be the same: a very long slide into mediocrity and mendacity.• Glen O’Hara is professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/057d82722f948da1e9f29c0ea9eccce574986daf/171_0_3330_1999/master/3330.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f114c875d88990dd6c69cc7085ee5a9d","title":"daily televised government briefings no 10 downing street press","story":"In televising its daily lobby briefings, Downing Street is giving an insight into its inner workings. It may not look goodWanted: experienced media professional, preferably female. Must be willing to front up contentious decisions on a daily basis and should be impervious to relentless questioning. Television experience essential, salary to be determined. It will be one of the stranger job advertisements a government has ever issued. But it’s happening. In October, the way the press and the public get their information from the people who run the country is changing. A new political spokesperson will conduct an afternoon daily briefing from No 9 Downing Street.That change is entirely without precedent in this country. So does it matter?Well, yes. At the most basic level, televised press briefings significantly alter the way the government will look and feel to the public. Whoever No 10 chooses immediately becomes one of, if not the, most visible members of the administration. The new face of Boris Johnson’s government – that’s what they’ll be – can expect significantly more media exposure than any of the cabinet.Things will be different for the lobby – that is, the newspaper and TV reporters who cover Westminster politics – too. Before Covid-19 hit, the prime minister’s official spokesman, a civil servant called James Slack (he’s brilliant, by the way, and has a team of equally brilliant press officers) conducted twice-daily lobby briefings. Off camera, but on the record, the hacks could ask whatever they liked – but the reporting was only really about the answers. Now there will be an afternoon audience of people ready to decide if the journalists are trying to get the information they want.I hope the new briefings don’t inadvertently lead to the death of the irreverent question. As the last prime minister’s spokesman, I remember the briefing where I was asked, “Paul, does the PM think it’s coming home?”, given England’s progress in the last World Cup. Or, on the day we launched a new childhood obesity plan, “Has Theresa May ever even had a McDonald’s?” (from memory – yes, thanks to one in her constituency she’d gone to officially open). Sometimes light-heartedness has a place. Sometimes it gets better answers.No 10’s logic is simple. The daily Covid-19 press conferences helped shape the news agenda at the time of day most people are paying attention. Downing Street reckons that around 10 million people regularly saw content from them on television – and for all politicians, the opportunity to communicate directly with the public is seductive. There’s also something to be said for governments being more open with, and thus accountable to, the electorate they serve – so the “transparency argument” is one you’ll hear a lot.The single biggest risk is also obvious. Press briefings – like newspapers – work best when the people involved have something to say. Inevitably, there will be days when No 10 doesn’t have a big announcement, and some of them will coincide with moments of real political pressure. While there’s a certain skill in saying little that makes news during a bad week (under the last prime minister we described those weeks as “sporty” or, when people started resigning, “choppy”), it definitely won’t look tremendous on television.That is where format will be crucial. At the moment, behind closed doors, there’s nothing to stop the lobby asking the same question 100 times in their briefings (there’s usually an inverse relationship between how many times a question gets asked and how much they like the answer). Artfully dodging a question once is one thing – but refusing to answer the same question 10 times is another. Whether the new system operates more like a press conference – one outlet, one question – or the current free-for-all, will affect the public’s impressions a lot.Another practical effect – to be honest, you could argue this could be either good or bad – is the centralisation of accountability. Ministers have to front up the decisions they are responsible for, but now there will be a way to get a reaction from No 10 that’s ready-made for television. It will mean more issues parked at Downing Street’s door, I suspect. And some stories that don’t amount to much but were pored over in briefings – we’d talk about “stuff that didn’t get out of the room” – will now, by definition, get out of it.Finally, this move continues to formalise the manner in which the government briefs the press. Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher’s press secretary, used to invite newspaper correspondents into his office, where they’d perch on the furniture to be given information on background. In 1997, Tony Blair’s government put the lobby briefing on the record for the first time. This is the next chapter in that story.The televised briefing is a gamble previous administrations have resisted. Now – from our living rooms – we’re all about to see if it pays off.• Paul Harrison served as Downing Street press secretary under Theresa May and is senior counsel at Lexington Communications"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4211cc32b338961d05e17ecae4c331915f644efb/2394_693_1605_963/master/1605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b560189da4286b6e535fa7c213f61bcb","title":"gcse a level results teachers unbiased schools universities 2020 results","story":"Schools and universities will have to think creatively about how to read the results of 2020The nail-biting wait for GCSE and A-level results has a surreal quality this year, as students wonder what the outcome could possibly be of exams they haven’t sat because of the Covid-19 lockdown.Most are assuming they’ll be awarded the grades they were predicted to have achieved by their schools, although it isn’t quite that simple: teachers are asked to both predict the grade and rank the students by the level of confidence the teacher has that each will attain that result. So you might be predicted a 9 at GCSE, then ranked first – most likely to achieve that 9 – which will enable exam boards to standardise results. It’s obviously not great for last-minute merchants, but otherwise sounds as fair as it could be in an imperfect world. But it relies on teachers having a high, almost robotic level of impartiality in their evaluations – being able to look past external signifiers, like disruptive or dozy behaviour, and see the raw potential underneath. Also, of course, it relies on there being no bias, conscious or unconscious, against any particular group in any given subject.From personal observation, I’ve never encountered a professional group that works harder than teachers to see past the confidence and polish of assorted privilege, to delve into what’s going on underneath. Yet teachers don’t exist under a bell jar, but are part of a society in which prejudices still flourish so it would be strange if they were entirely immune from them. I remember, too (just about), the fact that mine was the first year at university where finals were marked without sight of the students’ names: and it was also, by wild coincidence, the year that the number of women awarded first-class degrees surged. Some biases are so hard to shift that it’s quicker just to blindfold the judges.Frustratingly, in the world of public exams where measurement is all, one thing has not been measured: how close to the actual results do teachers get, and are they more accurate with some students than with others? The Sutton Trust wrote a report in 2017 about access to universities for disadvantaged students, Rules of the Game , which found that in a world where over-prediction was the norm, the most able students from poorer backgrounds were systematically under-predicted. This had such an impact on their aspirations that the pipeline problem started here. These students weren’t even applying to the universities that have such well-documented problems with ersity, since based on inaccurate predictions, they reasonably concluded they didn’t stand a chance of getting in. However, the results are complex – low-achieving students from poorer backgrounds were more likely to be over-predicted – and one of the first observations of the report is that this entire area is “surprisingly under-researched”.Professor Debora Price, now a gerontologist at Manchester University, did some work comparing GCSE predictions and results in the early 2000s, for one school – frustratingly, it was never published, as it was commissioned privately for that school. But Price’s fascinating observations were of systematic under-prediction for girls in sciences under-prediction for behaviourally difficult but able students under-prediction for ethnic minority students in every subject, particularly by certain teachers and under-predictions for boys in art. Because Price and her colleagues had access to those same students as they went into their A-levels, they unearthed some fascinating behavioural effects.First, she told me, “it emerged in focus groups that the kids knew that the teachers’ predictions were wrong. They knew which teachers were racist. The thing they weren’t very aware of were the gender biases. You might guess that from theory, because girls would have internalised those low expectations.” Second, they remarked on what Stanford researchers have termed “dynamic complementarities” – grades act as a signalling mechanism that affects behaviour. So students were strongly influenced by their predictions, but in pretty random ways. Some would see a low grade and give up, others would work harder. Some would get a high prediction and coast, others would gain confidence and rise to the expectation. So the overall inaccuracy of predictions was partly caused by the predictions themselves say you’re predicted an A, you stop working, you get a B, now the prediction is wrong: but was it? Or did it cause itself to be wrong?Schools and universities will have to think creatively about how to read the GCSE and A-level results of 2020. They can also seek to redress the biases that predictions have long introduced into our system – and to do so, we will at least be delivered a mammoth data set to work from. If this year sees girls underperforming in STEM subjects and BAME pupils performing less well than usual across all subjects, we will know definitively that there’s rot in the whole system. Ultimately, going beyond our current crisis, it may be that grade prediction as a waypoint for A-level choice and university admission should be abolished altogether."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8935c2733a6029c3e244d34188fb0bcfe385ddb/0_315_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f1b52c4a82391818bbe07d7d676f78a","title":"trans rights have been pitted against feminism but were not enemies","story":"One of the most distressing aspects of the hostile narrative is that it sidelines a reality of allianceAs a trans woman working in academia, one of the questions I regularly get asked is how I get along with feminist colleagues. When I invariably answer “incredibly well”, I’m often met with a quizzical look.I can understand why. As trans and gender ersity has become a regular topic of public debate and a favoured target of rightwing attacks, feminist critics have joined the fray.That has put trans and feminist activists on a seemingly unrelenting path of mutual antagonism. Trans rights have been pitted against sex-based rights for “real” women, with conflict forever spiralling into charge and countercharge of hate speech and silencing, and into bitter social media wars.Frustratingly, this conflict has become the dominant media story of trans and feminism, especially in a viciously ided UK. And, like post-lockdown carbon emissions, antagonism has now sadly rebounded – this time, via the tweets and blogs of JK Rowling and the ripples of commentary that have followed.One of the most distressing aspects of this relentless feminism versus trans narrative is that it tells a completely lopsided story. In fact, it sidelines a very different reality of alliance rather than ision.Trans and feminism have certainly had a wobbly relationship over the years, but trans writers have energetically drawn on and contributed to feminist theory, while trans politics has been positively embraced by many feminists. The story here is not one of political conflict, it’s of mutual recognition.It’s the same reality at the institutional level. Right now, trans and feminist advocates are happily working alongside each other in educational and cultural institutions, health settings, political parties, activist groups, media organisations and elsewhere.It is little wonder that my own daughters, both young feminists themselves, unreservedly see trans as ally, not enemy. The reasons for this are not hard to fathom. After all, a fundamental tenet of feminism is to end forms of oppression and the same rule must apply for a trans and gender-erse minority.What’s more, much contemporary feminism rejects the pathologising dogmatism of “gender critical” and “sex-based rights” advocacy that paints trans and gender ersity as effectively delusional.As both feminist and transfeminist writers have long pointed out, we are not immutably tethered to an innate experience of womanhood or manhood simply by being designated an F or an M at birth.This is not fantasy it’s based on decades of well-evidenced research. Bodies and their sex characteristics have material reality, a reality that trans people know all too well. But how we make collective sense of biology rests on social and political assumptions that are open to change. Likewise, gender socialisation on the basis of one’s assigned sex does not automatically determine our gender sensibility.None of this disputes theories of women’s oppression or seeks to diminish the gendered violence that women of all backgrounds experience. Nor does it suggest that sex and gender are matters of mere whim. It insists that trans and gender-erse iniduals have bodily knowledge and lived experience that either crosses or doesn’t fit a manwoman binary.Trans is no fleeting and shallow “identity choice” and no onslaught against women’s rights. It asks us to rethink conventions of sex and gender and to deal generously, not defensively, with change.This is a process, not a flick of a switch.The growing recognition of trans as a social reality ushers in both easily solvable and sometimes difficult shifts in the way we institutionally manage sex and gender. Given the history of gender politics, feminism has a stake in this change and feminist voices need to be heard.But a trans and feminist dialogue can only work through respectful alliance, not isiveness. It can only be effective through abandoning the dead-end of territory-claiming wars over biology and rights.This much has long been recognised within more alliance-oriented trans and feminist politics – and it matters on a personal as well as political level.To return to my starting point, as a trans woman I have found little but warm regard from feminist colleagues, students and friends of all ages. This has been an uplifting experience. But more than this, it provides respectful political ground on which to mutually live and think through sex and gender. Surely, in a time of pandemic, this is ground to further cultivate.• Kim Humphery is associate professor in sociology and social theory at RMIT University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae0454a083ceb4a2e15fb726f1e6c9586f7ce90a/254_0_1165_699/master/1165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67f190236cb4e343585d3301823a12ce","title":"uk us downplaying genocide tutsi rwanda 1994 un resolution","story":"Decades after the 1994 genocide, the countries have contested the wording of a UN resolution to remember its victimsAs the bodies piled up in the streets of Rwanda 26 years ago, no amount of spin could disguise the crime. There were no sealed camps the massacres were in broad daylight. Yet in the UN security council the UK and US governments avoided the question of mass killing and saw only a civil war.This bolstered arguments that nothing – they thought – could be done. It was scandalous, the Czech Republic’s ambassador Karel Kovanda told them, not to recognise that a genocide reminiscent of the Nazi Holocaust was under way. Kovanda remembers a friendly arm taking him aside as UK diplomats told him such inflammatory language outside the council would be “unhelpful”.At the end of April 1994, with the death toll estimated at 200,000 people the US insisted the UN’s mission in Rwanda be withdrawn, while the UK suggested a token force could remain. Their focus was on former Yugoslavia, where UN troops were recently reinforced and where more peacekeepers served than in the rest of the world. The force commander of the UN mission for Rwanda, lieutenant general Roméo Dallaire, concluded that by their selfish actions in the council, the UK and US had aided and abetted genocide.That the genocide of the Tutsi proceeded unhindered, accompanied by near universal indifference, is a scandal largely ignored. But it is worth recalling today because, all these years later, the US and UK are again at odds over the word genocide and this time with the membership of the general assembly.In a resolution (74273), adopted by consensus in the general assembly on 20 April, the wording to enshrine an international day to commemorate the victims of the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi was changed. The International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Rwandan Genocide became more specific, and 7 April became a day to commemorate the genocide “against the Tutsi” in Rwanda.Afterwards, the UK and US expressed reservations in letters to the president of the general assembly. The phrase “genocide against the Tutsi”, the US ambassador Kelly Craft complained, failed to capture “the magnitude” of the violence against “other groups” and left “an incomplete picture of this dark part of history”. She wrote: “Many Hutu and others were also killed during the genocide, including those murdered for their opposition to the atrocities that were being committed.”A letter from the UK chargé d’affaires, Jonathan Allen, objected to the “framing of the genocide purely as the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi”, seemingly hinting at two genocides. One sentence avoided the word genocide: “The UK remembers the tragic events in April 1994 and is firmly committed to ensuring that such atrocities never happen again.”An angry response from the Rwandan ambassador to the UN, Valentine Rugwabiza, accused them of distorting historical facts. While both pointed to other victims, these people were not killed in a genocide. Only one group was the target of extermination. This was the case when past genocides in history were commemorated.The UN had officially recognised the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi, she reminded them, and the council had established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) to prosecute those responsible. The tribunal’s appeals chamber had affirmed that genocide committed against the Tutsi was “beyond any dispute and not requiring any proof”.As the Rwandan ambassador predicted, and unusually for internal UN correspondence, there was interest in the UK and US letters from outside the secretariat. They circulated among genocide deniers, their supporters and acolytes, who claimed misgivings clearly existed at the highest levels, throwing into doubt the “official narrative”. The Hutu Power movement had for years tried to prove moral equivalence – that all sides were guilty in a bloody civil war, and the killing of Tutsi resulted from a spontaneous uprising of angry Hutu.In their trials at the ICTR, the perpetrators had claimed a second genocide of Hutu happened and was the subject of an international cover-up. One of the oldest claims in the Hutu Power disinformation handbook, it was dismissed by Human Rights Watch in 1994 as a smokescreen to distract foreign attention from the genocide of the Tutsi. Today, the Hutu Power movement still tries to prove that each “side” was as murderous as the other and that the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) had slaughtered “hundreds of thousands of Hutu”.No doubts exist that there were thousands of Hutu deaths. At the outset, Hutu Power eliminated the political opposition, killing all those against their racist anti-Tutsi ideology. Hutu were killed in the civil war and no one ever denied retributive killings by soldiers of Paul Kagame’s RPF who defeated the army of the genocidal Hutu Power government. Many RPF soldiers had entered the country to find the bodies of their Tutsi families.For those who liberated their country 26 years ago, the attitudes in the letters were reminiscent of those on display in 1994. The council had fixated on the civil war taking place simultaneously with the genocide of the Tutsi. But continually calling for a ceasefire, ambassador Kovanda told them, was like wanting Hitler to reach a ceasefire with the Jews.The 1948 Genocide Convention provides a legal requirement to prevent and punish the crime and enshrines the “never again” promise. After the Holocaust there was a realisation that state-sanctioned racist policies against specific groups inevitably led to mass slaughter, the victims chosen purely because they were members of the target group.No greater example exists of the discrepancy between promise and performance, between abiding by an international treaty and ignoring it. In three terrible months in Rwanda, more than one million people were murdered. That Britain and the United States continue to find it difficult to commemorate a clear case of genocide has inevitably led to speculation they find it difficult to acknowledge their own past error.• Linda Melvern is a British investigative journalist.

Now we are forced to experience travel as others doLast week, the European Union released a highly anticipated list: countries whose Covid-19 levels are low enough for their travelers to enter Europe now that borders have reopened to non-essential travel. The US is not on it.Given the rising numbers of cases being reported around America, this is hardly surprising news. Still, it deals a blow to Americans who were holding on to the hope of somehow squeezing in a trip to Europe this summer. I include myself had everything gone to plan, I would have been sunning on the beaches of Paros, Greece, with family and friends right now.But you know what? I’m actually happy that Americans have been banned from the EU. It’s a good thing for us Americans, not just for the obvious public health reasons that will keep other regions safe from a resurgence of a virus they have worked diligently to contain. Being stuck on the sidelines while the rest of the world gets to experience the joy of European travel also provides us with a rare opportunity to think critically about the meaning of global citizenship. We shouldn’t waste it.This is a humiliating and humbling moment. The US has long had a reputation for leadership in coordinating responses to worldwide emergencies, including the 2008 economic meltdown and the 2014 Ebola crisis. In contrast, the current pandemic saw the US not only fail to lead on a global scale but fail to act on a domestic level. Other countries have led the way in terms of containment measures, while the US has been mired in politicized fights over the very existence or seriousness of the virus. The failures of American political leaders – and many of our citizens – to take the virus seriously have made the US the worst kind of world leader: we now have the highest number of confirmed cases and confirmed deaths from Covid-19.This has not gone unnoticed by our neighbors, friends and foes around the world. Now ordinary Americans are being held collectively responsible for decisions and actions we may have had nothing to do with. So many of us did everything “right” in terms of following quarantine orders and wearing masks and keeping our distance while in public. And yet here we all are – on the outside, looking in. We now find ourselves in the uncomfortable position more familiar to the Syrian, Nigerian and Iranian citizens who are routinely, unilaterally denied entry to the US and other countries, no matter their inidual actions, belief systems or political persuasions.This is not to say that those bans are justified, especially considering their roots in anti-Muslim rhetoric, but rather to ask Americans to set aside feelings of self-pity in favor of empathy for those who have never been able to take being welcome on other shores for granted. In fact, an awareness of and compassion for the kinds of challenges other people and communities face is a cornerstone of global citizenship. It is what drives us to be forces of change.One change might come in the form of working at all levels to make visitors to the US – from tourists to refugees – feel more welcome and accepted. Another change should involve never again taking our own sense of welcome and acceptance for granted, in Europe or anywhere else. After all, this sense of entitlement has often led to bad behaviors like insulting Spanish ticket sellers for not speaking English, carving names into Rome’s Colosseum, and bathing in the Trevi fountain. Such actions not only cast a negative light on Americans but result in penalties that affect all tourists, such as barricades around major attractions. They also exacerbate the ills of mass tourism, which is already harming housing markets (thanks to Airbnb) and putting a wedge between visitors and residents that threatens to cut off the kinds of cross-cultural exchanges that are such important elements of global citizenship. How can we build connections to other people when they – often rightly – believe we don’t respect their homes?If and when EU borders reopen to US nationals, it will be tempting to make up for lost time and book flights landing on the first day we are welcome back. But it’s time to think more critically about global travel. We must acknowledge its costs in terms of both climate change and “overtourism”, which encompasses the erse environmental, social and cultural impacts of tourism to already heavily trafficked areas. If we want to bequeath any elements of our current world to future generations, we must reduce our carbon footprints and overall impact on the locales we visit. This may mean forgoing trips to bucket-list destinations in favor of lesser-trod locales or simply exploring closer to home.The idea of never going back to Europe or to other popular overseas destinations is a tough pill to swallow, particularly when we’re all nursing fantasies of a post-Covid-19 future. Unfortunately, that future might demand the same thing of us as the present: setting aside our own personal desires, appealing to our highest collective angels, and sacrificing for the sake of the greater good. Are we up to it?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aeb3e17e9681088240f38253d78bc8dcf3b7d51/0_260_3989_2395/master/3989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b394fbdacdf05f61f63a72b8b7d5b96","title":"rhodes statue is going now universities must ask what about john locke elizabeth i and others","story":"UK academia has to accept its traditions and ideas have made it a hostile environment to manyThe academic world, noted FM Cornford in 1908, runs on the principle of “unripe time”. The new proposal might be an excellent idea, but the time is not yet ripe. And, he remarked, time is like the medlar fruit: “it has a trick of going rotten before it is ripe”.Well, amazingly, we seem to be in time-ripening season. The chilling death of George Floyd and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement has turned on a floodlight. Now discussions of institutional racism and white privilege may end with an action plan, rather than the appointment of a sub-committee.The change has been a long time coming. The analysis of institutional racism dates back at least to 1967, in the book Black Power by Kwame Ture (writing under the name Stokely Carmichael) and Charles Hamilton. Ture and Hamilton compare overt racist acts, such as lynching and arson, with the institutional racism of routine lack of access to medical care and the inflated rents charged by slum landlords. The book, which terrified white America, was largely about how to get black Americans to register for their newly granted voting rights and finally make a difference.White privilege, even white supremacy, has been understood for much, much, longer. It has rarely been better described than by Malcolm X in the last speech he gave before he was assassinated in 1965:“In Asia or the Arab world or in Africa, where the Muslims are, if you find one who says he’s white, all he’s doing is using an adjective to describe something that’s incidental about him … so there’s nothing else to it, he’s just white. But when you get the white man over here in America and he says he’s white, he means something else. You can listen to the sound of his voice – when he says he’s white, he means he’s a boss.”It’s taken half a century, but academia, alongside arts, industry, and popular culture, is finally trying to work out what it can do to end the association between being white and being dominant.Take university curriculums. In my own case I teach political philosophy, typically to students from more than 50 countries. Every year my colleagues and I comb over sources to find accessible non-white, non-western authors on the topics we teach. It’s a struggle.What can you do if you can’t find the texts? This year we are taking what now seems the obvious step of considering changing some of the topics, too, such as including African ideas of community and nationhood, as well as the Black Lives Matter campaign. The time is ripe.Universities talk the language of ersity, especially of students and staff. But ersity is a passive concept, the mentality of a collector. The word “participation” is now emerging. It’s not only a question of who is accepted on to the course, though that is vitally important, but what students do when they are there. Who speaks, who doesn’t? More importantly, who is heard?The sociologist Erving Goffman wrote that the default ideal American was a “young, married, white, urban, northern, heterosexual protestant father, of college education, fully employed, of good complexion, weight and height and a recent record in sports”. His point is apt. Some people glide into place, while others have to do all the hard work of fitting in. This privilege must end.And things outside the classroom can make the university feel like home to some, and a hostile environment to others. Which brings me to statues. On a visit to the University of Cape Town in 2014 I was astonished to see the huge figure of Cecil Rhodes looming over the main staircase, surveying the plain. He’s no longer there, and soon, we are told, his statue in Oxford will depart, too. Monuments to people who terrorised the ancestors of current students reinforce the distinction between insiders and outsiders. What was put up first for political purposes can surely be removed for political purposes too.But now we have started, where do we stop?

I wore this black crepe A-line dress, with velvet bands across it and a rather pretty stand-up collar, for the prorogation decision, but the black spider brooch in this picture is a different one.The spider in this photograph lived on that dress and I had decided that it was the appropriate dress to wear for the prorogation judgment, but when I got it out of the wardrobe the spider was no longer there. It had obviously dropped off at some point and I couldn’t find it, so, because a spider lived on that dress, I looked in my drawer and found another redder, silvery, sparkly one.A lot was made of my wearing that brooch on that day. I know that Madeleine Albright was quite deliberately giving messages with her brooches – she has written a lovely book about it called Read My Pins I’ve got it. But I wasn’t giving any sort of hidden message – I’m not a politician, so I don’t play any part in politics. If I had realised some of the things that people might have speculated, then I would probably have worn an innocuous bunch of flowers.I started to wear brooches when I was in the family ision of the high court. I was wearing, on the whole, dark suits and my husband started buying me brooches to lighten them. The first brooch he bought for me was a spider. I don’t think there is any particular reason I have so many spider brooches. The spider is a very good artistic theme – you can do a lot with a spider. The same is true of frogs, I have a lot of frogs.Of course, once one person sees you wearing something, then other people – members of the family or friends who want to give me a present – start giving you much the same. And so the collection grows. I don’t know how many I have, but there are a lot.None of my brooches are worth very much they are all costume jewellery. The infamous spider brooch was from Cards Galore it cost about £12. They are mostly creatures of one sort or another. Bugs, beetles, a dragonfly, a fox and a nice little cat. But I think to say I was a fan of the natural world might be putting it a little high.I tend to wear them more in London than I do up here in Yorkshire. I haven’t been wearing many brooches in lockdown, because I’m not going out anywhere. But I have been trying to keep presentable – I’ve got quite a lot of new casual clothes, like jeans and tops from Joules comfortable, but not jogging bottoms or pyjamas.People comment on women’s appearance much more than they comment on men’s, but I recall in another case most of the press comment was not on what I was wearing during the hearing – it was all on one of my fellow justice’s ties. I had taken great care to wear a different dress and brooch each day and nobody noticed!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64a414b7adf0b38683ccbbf9fcf6206a9c1c5bd3/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9574c97150e3067d5453f14a0f78948d","title":"johnny depp reputation on line libel trial set to begin amber heard","story":"Actor to face ex-wife Amber Heard in UK court during case against publisher of the Sun newspaperThe long-anticipated showdown between the Hollywood stars Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard opens in a British courtroom on Tuesday in a libel trial that will subject his international reputation to forensic legal scrutiny.Highly embarrassing allegations about the former couple’s private lives have already spilled out during bitter pre-trial hearings in which the Pirates of the Caribbean actor tried to stop Heard from attending court until she is due to give evidence.The legal drama, scheduled to run for three weeks, is being spaced out across five courts in the Royal Courts of Justice due to the need to respect social distancing. The cost in lawyers’ fees and court facilities will run into millions, though any damages eventually awarded are likely to be far lower.Depp, 57, is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN) and the Sun’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an article published in 2018 that referred to the film star as a “wife beater”.The article related to allegations made against Depp by Heard, 34, that he was violent towards her during their marriage. He strenuously denies the claims and is also pursuing her in a separate libel battle over the issue in the US.Both Heard and Depp are expected to attend the London trial, having, it is believed, already travelled to the UK from their homes in California and France respectively.Depp’s lawyers will seek to prove the Sun’s allegations are not true and amount to “serious harm” as defined in the Defamation Act 2013. They are likely to argue that the accusations of abuse have lost him lucrative film roles.Originally due to begin in March, the case was delayed due to Covid-19. Witnesses expected to give evidence include Depp‘s former partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder.NGN, which will call Heard to defend its story, attempted to have the case struck out last week on the grounds that Depp had not disclosed key text messages. That appeal was dismissed.The newspaper says it is relying on 14 separate allegations of domestic violence, between early 2013 and May 2016, in its defence.Courtroom accusations have already featured claims that Heard had “two extra-marital affairs” or “extra-relationship affairs” with Elon Musk and the actor James Franco while she was with Depp.Depp has been accused of trying to obtain drugs during a visit to Australia when he allegedly texted an assistant seeking “happy pills” and “whitey stuff”, which was said to refer MDMA and cocaine.The couple met in 2011 on the set of the comedy The Rum Diary and married in Los Angeles in 2015. The following year, Heard obtained a restraining order against Depp after accusing him of abuse, which he denied.The couple settled their orce out of court in 2017. Heard donated her $7m (£5.5m) settlement to charity.The high court case will be heard by Mr Justice Nicol, with NGN represented by Adam Wolanski QC and Depp by the barrister David Sherborne.Emily Cox, a partner at Stewarts law firm and an expert in defamation cases, said: “This is a critical case for Depp as his entire career is at risk, as well as his personal reputation and standing among his adoring fans across the globe.“It’s unlikely he is pursuing the claim for financial reasons alone as damages for libel in England rarely surpass £100,000, although that is not beyond the realms of possibility in a case of this nature. Sometimes the libel courts may be the only route for someone to clear their name, and London is an attractive place for celebrities to bring claims as English defamation laws are known to be claimant-friendly.“The stakes for Depp are high: Hollywood has ignored and sanctioned some despicable behaviour by celebrities in the past, but a new wind is blowing through Tinseltown as well as society as a whole. It is likely to be crucial for Depp that he clears his name.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f74f6ef249bfde127f51ac8ddd0802c7be1fcddf/0_150_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b397f5c5b25a322b7cf8d9bfb719434","title":"jorginho starting to look the odd man out in chelsea midfield plans","story":"The Italian has lost his place and could depart this summer, with Frank Lampard preferring more flexible optionsWhen N’Golo Kanté went down with a hamstring injury during the closing stages of Chelsea’s win over Watford on Saturday, it was revealing that Frank Lampard turned to a teenager instead of his vice-captain. Billy Gilmour came on and Jorginho remained in the stands, wondering when he will get to take part in Project Restart.The impression is of a player fighting to prove his worth all over again. Derided as the face of Sarriball last year, Jorginho has not featured at all since the season resumed last month. After working hard to win the Chelsea faithful over at the start of the campaign, the Italy international is back on uncertain ground.With Kanté and Mateo Kovacic injured, the stage could be set for Jorginho to shine when Chelsea visit Crystal Palace on Tuesday evening. Yet public support from Lampard will mean nothing if the former Napoli midfielder stands aside for Gilmour, the gifted 19-year-old Scot.It has been an abrupt change for Jorginho, who has had an important role for much of Lampard’s first season as Chelsea’s manager. Only Kepa Arrizabalaga, the goalkeeper, and César Azpilicueta, the captain, played more minutes than the 27-year-old before the suspension of the season. Jorginho is popular in the dressing room and he worked to please Lampard, showing more urgency on the ball.Last season, however, there was the controversy of Maurizio Sarri using Jorginho in a deep-lying role and moving Kanté to the right. It was an awkward fit and Lampard wants Kanté shielding the back four. Jorginho, booked 13 times this season, lacks the pace to perform defensive duties and there is a feeling that Gilmour has a sharper range of passing and movement.Gilmour sat deep in the 4-0 win over Everton just before lockdown, giving Mason Mount and Ross Barkley the freedom to roam, and that trio could start against Palace. Although Gilmour was taken off at half-time during the win over Leicester in the FA Cup last month, he is a threat to Jorginho’s future at Stamford Bridge.Where next for the Brazil-born man, though? Juventus, managed by Sarri, made sense until they signed Arthur in a swap deal that took Miralem Pjanic to Barcelona. Chelsea paid £50m to sign Jorginho in 2018 and, with big moves to fund, will not want to sell him on the cheap. It is a tricky balancing act for Lampard, who respects Jorginho’s ability and leadership.“He does not have to do anything different,” Lampard said. “He trains well, he shows me that he’s good for the group, on and off the pitch, he’s vice-captain of the club. It’s purely my choice with what I see from the games, how I want the make-up of my midfield to be.”Yet change is in the air at Chelsea. Lampard wants a new left-back, with Leicester’s Ben Chilwell his top target. He is concerned about his side’s physical shortcomings when defending set pieces and is tracking West Ham’s Declan Rice, who can play at centre-back or defensive midfield.Chelsea, who have already sharpened their attack by buying Timo Werner from RB Leipzig and Hakim Ziyech from Ajax, are also leading the race to sign Bayer Leverkusen’s Kai Havertz. Bayern Munich have said that they cannot afford Havertz this summer and it is understood that the 21-year-old German does not want to wait a year before leaving Leverkusen. A move to London appeals to the attacking midfielder.Lampard wants more creativity. He has complained about Chelsea’s ability to break teams down this season, criticising their slow passing. Yet the Watford game hinted at a solution. Mount moved back from the No 10 role and thrived as a No 8, impressing with snappy, aggressive passing.“I do like midfield players who can perform not all the roles but can play high, can play on the side, can do the defensive duties and Mason really has that,” Lampard said. “His work off the ball is fantastic and if I feel like getting him high up the pitch to put more pressure on the other team if they want to play out, that can help us off the ball.“Sometimes I’ll ask him to do a slightly different role where he comes deeper to make sure he’s not missing out on the ball. Ross can perform that kind of role. Kovacic can perform that kind of role. Ruben Loftus-Cheek can perform that kind of role. Kanté can perform that kind of role. Gilmour can. Jorginho also can but his role predominantly in his career has been from a deeper position. I like to work on the midfield, making it as fluid as it possibly can be.”There was the message for Jorginho: become more flexible, more rounded. It is not over yet but the clock is ticking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff0d0b847c4e62c70dbc347c7e493743d43f5d03/0_21_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d09f6ea0266775b4a432b9ad3d28564c","title":"yazidi women are strong kurdistans female landmine clearance teams","story":"Isis planted mines across Sinjar and displaced the Yazidi community. Now a group of women are clearing the way for the return of their peopleBehind Hana Khider is a large grey wall map, with the minefields her team have been clearing marked in green. “This is the place where Yazidis lived together,” she says. “It’s where I lived in my childhood I have so many memories here, it’s very important to me.”The place is Sinjar, or Shingal as Yazidis know it, on Iraq’s north-western border with Syria. Khider, 28, is speaking via video call from her office in the region. “This job is so important to me because I feel like I’m doing something good for my family, my community and the people who were displaced from Sinjar. By removing the mines, I’m helping them to maybe one day come back.”In August 2014, Isis invaded and occupied this region. The group murdered about 5,000 Yazidis, kidnapped and enslaved 6,000 women and children and displaced a community that had been living in towns and villages nestled around Sinjar mountain, sacred to Yazidis, for centuries.“Before we had a normal life. Everything was good, people were living their life happily. But after the genocide in 2014, everything changed. We’re no longer secure,” Khider says.By the time Isis was pushed out of Sinjar in 2017, it had planted hundreds of thousands of landmines and other explosive devices in homes, buildings and fields. The group manufactured them on an industrial scale, but also used household items including pots, pans and even video game controllers – whatever it could get its hands on – to build improvised devices.“People are killed or injured on a daily basis south of the mountain,” Khider explains. An important part of her work is educating the community and children in particular, who are at greatest risk. In one area, a man told her an explosion had killed his 15-year-old nephew as he was out in the fields looking after a herd. His other nephew sustained life-altering injuries.A new film, Into the Fire, follows Khider and her team of Yazidi women at Mines Advisory Group (MAG), an international charity which removes unexploded bombs in former war zones across the world, as they clear Sinjar.The high level of mine contamination is one reason why, three years on from Sinjar’s liberation from Isis, only about a quarter of the population have returned.Almost 300,000 Yazidi people still live in tented camps and makeshift shelters in the nearby Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Conditions are poor and the community has inadequate access to services, including treatment for high rates of mental illness. Over 2,000 women and children are still missing.Those who have gone back are living mainly north of the mountain that ides Sinjar, according to Portia Stratton, Iraq country director for MAG.“The north of the mountain, although badly affected, was less contaminated than the south, as Isis held it for a much shorter period. Also with populations moving back more to the north, we have historically had more information about the contamination in those areas.“In the south, especially, a lot of work remains to be done,” she says.The charity cleared Khider’s village in 2016, enabling her and her family to move back, although not to their old house. It had sustained too much damage for that.A high proportion of homes across the district have been similarly affected, with many completely destroyed. Shrines, schools and public buildings lie in ruins.“There’s also a lack of services, like medical care and education, especially in the villages,” Khider says. Two of her children are in school, but they have to walk miles everyday through war damage to attend. “What I want more than anything is for them to be safe and free.”Despite the dangers of her work, Khider never gets scared. “I have confidence in myself and I know that I’m doing the right thing.”Part of the problem is that Sinjar falls within Iraq’s “disputed territories”, areas claimed by both the Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan regional government.Political tussling has fuelled conflict, fragmented authority and left Yazidis and other minorities, including Assyrians, Turkmen and Shabaks, in Sinjar and the nearby Nineveh Plains, particularly vulnerable.There is “a lack of functioning government”, according to Abid Shamdeen, the executive director of Nadia’s Iniative, a charity working in Sinjar set up by Nobel peace prize laureate Nadia Murad.A lack of official law enforcement in the region also “engenders both chaos and fear”, he says.A multitude of militias with competing affiliations operate in the area, preventing former residents from returning and hindering reconstruction. This insecurity was highlighted in mid-June by the latest in a series of Turkish air strikes on Sinjar Mountain targeting Kurdish militants, but hitting areas in close proximity to civilians.“When will @IraqiGovt \u0026amp the international community apply some courage \u0026amp political will to resolving security challenges in Sinjar?” tweeted Murad in response.Despite this precariousness, Khider is committed to the home that she loves. She has now started a new garden.“I’ve planted simple things, some flowers, vegetables like cucumbers, tomatoes, aubergines,” she says. “I feel like they all have a soul and spirit. I feel happy just watching them.” It is this attitude that attracted Orlando von Einsiedel, the Oscar-winning director of The White Helmets, to Khider’s story.“Into the Fire doesn’t focus on the darkness of Isis and its actions. I wanted it instead to focus on the incredible resilience and fortitude of those who survived their atrocities and who are rebuilding their lives and their communities.”He also hopes that the film will bring greater awareness of the role women play in rebuilding their communities after conflict. “Across the world, MAG has extraordinary teams of female deminers – many of them mothers – who totally challenge stereotypical perceptions of what is ‘woman’s work’.”Khider thinks this work is one way the women on her team, some of whom are former Isis captives and all of whom lost family and friends in 2014, can recover.“They’re doing this job that previously maybe only men were doing, and it gives them confidence in themselves. They’re doing something good for their community and their family, and they can also depend on themselves, financially and in other ways.”Khider still works with all the women, but has since been promoted to lead a larger team that includes men. Since 2016 she and her colleagues have cleared more than 27,000 mines from areas liberated from Isis.When she first saw Into the Fire, she says: “I felt sad seeing the reality that we are living in now and all the things that happened to my community and Yazidi people. But I also felt happy to see the good things that my team and I are doing.“I hope the film shows people around the world that we Yazidi women are strong, we don’t give up and that we are able to stand up again and live our life, even after everything that we have been through.”Into the Fire is available to view on National Geographic’s YouTube channel"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9f1c1896d3c8d1f541ab111bdfae2f4cdf596a/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f240a7b91644f498104ee2eb434efb8","title":"why i dont have a child i watched my own mother struggle with parenthood","story":"When there were too many kid-related errands … my mother would break down and cry, calling out to no one in particular ‘When is it my turn?!’ Any time I try to make sense of my strong aversion to motherhood and my utter glee over having escaped it, my mind immediately turns to the “mother-daughter day” my mom took me out of school for in the spring of 1975, a year before she and my father split up.Our mid-week adventure came as a complete surprise to me, although I was happy for the day off from fourth grade, as any nine-year-old would be. It was going to be a special day for just us, my mother promised. We were headed to the politan Museum of Art in Manhattan, and to lunch at a fancy restaurant.She’d buried the lede, though, neglecting to warn me about the first stop on the drive from our house on Long Island: a red brick, three-story office building in Lynbrook, where her therapist practiced.“This is Mrs Abramson,” my mother said, directing me to sit on the couch beside her. “I come here every week to talk to her about my feelings.”Mrs Abramson was a matronly older woman in a navy polyester dress, with a bouffant helmet of hair dyed flat brown. She focused her eyes on me intently and smiled artificially. I was so confused – was I just along for the ride on one of my mother’s boring adult errands? Or did I have a role here? Was I in trouble for something?After an awkward pause, Mrs Abramson nodded to my mother, who then turned to me. “I know you really loved Nanny,” she said, referring to my maternal grandmother, my favorite person in the world, who’d died of breast cancer three years before, “but she wasn’t a very nice mother to me. She wasn’t warm to me the way she was to you. She was cold and selfish.”My mother launched into a laundry list of grievances. She recounted instances in which my grandmother left her and my uncle alone for whole days at a time when they were still small, so she could take long drives by herself, despite my mother’s tearful pleas for her not to leave. She said Nanny was emotionally handicapped, not “mother material”, because her own mother had died when my grandmother was just three, in 1919, at the end of the influenza epidemic. After my grandmother’s mother passed, her father couldn’t handle raising a toddler by himself. He had a nervous breakdown and sent my grandmother away to live with an aunt. My mother insisted that this series of tragic events rendered Nanny incapable of being nurturing.I listened intently, but the information did not compute. No one showed me more love than Nanny had. Before she died, I would frequently sleep over on Saturday nights. It was the highlight of my week. Kindred creative spirits, Nanny and I would draw and paint together. We’d watch Shirley Temple movies and sing along to Animal Crackers in My Soup. Sunday mornings, we’d watch Wonderama and dance together, pretending we were right there on the set.I wasn’t yet old enough to know that grandparent-child relationships can be much easier than parent-child relationships, or to realize that I had come along just in time to serve as a welcome distraction from the cancer that was killing Nanny, which might have led her to be warmer to me than she’d been to my mother.Before I had a chance to fully consider the alternate version of Nanny my mother presented in her therapist’s office, she moved on to an even more stunning reveal: She and my father were considering separating. She still loved my father very much, she insisted, but marriage and parenthood were very hard.That last bit was less surprising. I had witnessed my mother struggling with motherhood. When I was very small, she seemed to relish spending time with me – playing dress-up and make-believe, mixing up homemade Play-Doh on a snow day. Now she often seemed put-upon when having to do the lion’s share of parenting for two daughters, as she did. When there were too many kid-related errands, too many doctor and vet appointments, too many helpless beings (my sister, me, our dog) tugging at her, she would break down and cry, calling out to no one in particular “When is it my turn?!” Later, as an adult trying to understand what my mother’s experience, I would be able to factor in that she had married when she was just 19, practically a child still, and had her first kid at 25. She’d never really had her turn.When my mother was done talking, her therapist nodded to her again, and she stood. “Now you can talk to Mrs Abramson about your feelings,” she said, exiting the room and leaving me alone with her shrink.I felt blindsided. I had no idea what I was supposed to say, let alone feel. I was afraid to utter anything that might upset or betray my mom. So I just sat there, silent.Attending my mother’s highly choreographed therapy session nearly 45 years ago presented me with so much stunning information at once, all of it difficult for my child’s mind to grasp. It ushered in many thorny questions I was too afraid to ask, leaving me to obsess over them on my own for years to come.Like, how did you know if you were “mother material”? What if you weren’t, and you didn’t find out until after you had kids, and started neglecting them? My mother often said my personality was similar to Nanny’s – that I was not only “artsy” like her, but also “aloof” and “selfish”. Many years later I would wrestle with these descriptions in my own therapy sessions, along with the realization that my mother had inappropriately burdened me, too young, with her emotional needs – something my father was guilty of, as well, after my parents orced.Sometimes I wonder whether having the tables turned on me like that so early in life – having been “parentalized” to use 1970s psychobabble – plus frequently being tasked with watching my little sister, made me feel spent as a care-taker. Did it contribute to my lack of desire for kids? My sense that they are nothing but exhausting?I arrived very late to owning my lack of maternal desire. I was so anxious about the stigma associated with not wanting kids – so afraid of confronting further evidence that I was “selfish”, or garnering the pity and shame that had been foisted upon my older cousins who didn’t have them – that between the end of my first marriage at 26 and meeting my current husband at 38, I avoided even really asking myself whether I did want them.Now and then, though, I would secretly entertain my biggest fears: If I were to make babies, might I feel trapped, as my mother seemed to? Would I perpetuate a family legacy of daughters feeling insufficiently mothered – as I had, as my mother had, and as her mother had – passing down to future generations the effects of trauma that began with my great-grandmother’s untimely death? Would I wind up burdening and traumatizing my children with my emotional needs in a parent-child role reversal, as both my parents did?Then, ten years ago, as I was approaching 44, I underwent a hysterectomy that not only provided relief from a painful condition called adenomyosis it also helped me come to terms with my lack of interest in motherhood. Ironically, my husband and I had been pursuing fertility treatment right up until my diagnosis. When we learned I needed an operation that would effectively obliterate the possibility of child-bearing, I was relieved. My husband was, too.A part of me still wonders if I am the way I am because I’m “damaged”, or “selfish”, or because I’m just not naturally inclined toward motherhood. If forgoing it altogether had been presented to me as a valid option growing up, would I have simply opted out based on my personal preferences, and who I am? Or is who I am impossible to separate from the influences of my upbringing?I might never figure it out. All I know is that at 54, I’m happy living a childless life, in which I feel unencumbered and free – and in which it’s pretty much always my turn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f812d8e51d5337cc6def633bbadb3725967d2c3/0_57_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=718c5f78ebf510a5f015cd8c6878cd95","title":"almost one in six britons say would refuse covid 19 vaccine","story":"Campaigners say social media firms behaving irresponsibly over anti-vaccine materialNearly one in six Britons will refuse a coronavirus vaccine if and when one becomes available, and a similar number are unsure whether they will get one, according to a survey.The findings come amid a significant rise in anti-vaccination sentiment on social media, and represent a threat to efforts to contain the disease.“Our hope for a return to normal life rests with scientists developing a successful vaccine for coronavirus,” said Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a non-profit organisation that commissioned the research. “But social media companies’ irresponsible decision to continue to publish anti-vaccine propaganda means a vaccine may not be effective in containing the virus. The price for their greed is a cost paid in lives.”The 150 largest anti-vaccination social media pages and YouTube channels tracked by CCDH have collected about 8 million more followers since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, and the 400 outlets in the sample have a combined 55 million followers.Some of those pages have published false conspiracy theories including that Bill Gates created the pandemic, that vaccines cause Covid-19, and that tests for a coronavirus vaccine have caused women to become infertile.The majority of the followers are on Facebook, despite the company officially opposing anti-vaccination content. In July 2019 the company announced policies to reduce the spread of posts with “exaggerated or sensational health claims”.A Facebook product manager said at the time: “People come together on Facebook to talk about, advocate for, and connect around things like nutrition, fitness and health issues. But in order to help people get accurate health information and the support they need, it’s imperative that we minimise health content that is sensational or misleading.”As well as so-called organic sharing, both Facebook and Twitter have enabled advertising opposing vaccination, despite bans on such promotions on both sites. Those adverts come from influencers including David Wolfe, described by the CCDH as “an anti-vaccine wellness guru”, who promoted a popular panacea, colloidal silver, as “my #1 recommendation under the current crisis”.The group said: “Other adverts featured Judy Mikovits’ anti-vaxx conspiracy theories, who featured in the notorious Plandemic film, and adverts placed by Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Children’s Health Defense campaign that promote health misinformation about both vaccines and 5G mobile phone signals.”Advertisers can target their promotions at users who Facebook’s algorithm has decided may have interests such as “vaccine-preventable diseases” or who have liked the page “Talk About Curing Autism”. On Twitter, advertising categories such as “antivaxx” and “natural immunity” are available for all to use.“This sophisticated ecosystem has grown by exploiting weaknesses in each social media company’s policies on anti-vaxx and health misinformation,” Ahmed said. “Each platform plays a role in feeding and growing the whole.“Full-time anti-vaxx campaigners doubled their reach by broadcasting their message on YouTube channels that peddle conspiracy theories and false cures. In turn, these campaigners lend their brand and audience of activists to a thriving industry of anti-vaxx entrepreneurs using Facebook as a shopfront.”Ahmed added: “Both groups have benefited from the reach of professional conspiracists on YouTube and from a network of Facebook groups that turns vaccine sceptics into true believers using psychological hacks like the dopamine hit for ‘likes’ and the fear of abuse for nonconformity.”In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said: “We are working to stop harmful misinformation from spreading on our platforms and have removed hundreds of thousands of pieces of COVID-19-related misinformation. We reduce vaccine misinformation in News Feed, we don’t show it in search results or recommend it to you on Facebook or Instagram, we don’t allow it in ads, and we connect people with authoritative information from recognised health experts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e3bcf27c738c1a9f5621920d46cadf518962d1/0_154_2848_1708/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=323b6530364202f602910467e8ef79e7","title":"taking on sir humphrey can the civil service be reformed podcast","story":"Michael Gove has set out his plans for a revolution of Britain’s permanent bureaucracy, the civil service. But as former Downing Street chief of staff Jonathan Powell argues, it is easier said than doneWhen Jonathan Powell arrived in Downing Street in 1997 as Tony Blair’s chief of staff, he was met with a handshake from the head of the civil service. From then on, it was this institution, comprising hundreds of thousands of apolitical government employees, that would be tasked with turning the new ideas into reality.  Powell tells Anushka Asthana that it was not easy: many officials are reluctant to run with new ideas, or tend to look for problems rather than solutions. It’s an issue that the current Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has also identified. In a recent speech, he promised to shake things up: move more civil servants out of London, make them take more risks, and become more specialist and numerate. For Jonathan Powell, the acid test will be whether Gove can deliver on these words, which have echoes back to the 1960s and Harold Wilson’s government’s promises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bb72740b69a66a7a762d023fb6a3ed2c42a8664/0_90_2708_1624/master/2708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82828d4a871aeb8aa81f5bb887b3f4b4","title":"uk calls halt to data on number of people tested for covid 19","story":"After ‘temporary pause’ in publishing figure, government makes decision permanentThe UK government has said it will no longer publish data on the daily number of inidual people being tested for coronavirus, after five weeks of failing to release such statistics.Downing Street said the decision had been taken because figures only count people having their first Covid-19 test, and as NHS and care staff can now often have regular tests, this could skew the statistics.The following groups of people can\u0026nbspask for a test through the NHS website:The following groups of people can access priority testing through the gov.uk website:The government has published guidance on\u0026nbsptesting for essential workers\u0026nbspand the\u0026nbsplist of essential workers\u0026nbspbelow.The government says that tests for essential workers are prioritised over the tests available for the wider public through the NHS.However, it drew criticism from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who accused ministers of “dodging scrutiny” and covering up a failure to meet targets.The government still publishes daily figures for the number of tests carried out, and total testing capacity, but has not released a number for how many inidual were tested since 22 May. At the time, the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it had been “temporarily paused”.On Monday, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the DHSC had made this permanent, and would only publish figures for the number of tests.“This is because the daily people-tested statistic only counts new people being tested,” he said. “For example, someone who is tested in February and then tested again this month will only be counted once.“Considering hospital and care home staff are now being tested on a regular basis, we don’t think this statistic would be an accurate reflection of the amount of daily testing that is taking place.”Justin Madders, the shadow health minister, said the situation was “an absolute shambles”. He said: “It seems that the real reason why the government stopped issuing figures for the number of people tested each day is because they never hit their 100,000 people a day target and they were too embarrassed to admit it.“It is clear that ministers are losing control over the testing regime and are failing to not only keep track of the tests but to ensure the results are returned swiftly.”Layla Moran, the Lib Dem MP who is heading a cross-party group seeking an independent inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic, said such data was “vital to ensure decision-makers are held to account”.She said: “First the government cancelled the daily press conferences, now they’ve stopped publishing the numbers of people who’ve actually been tested. It seems that at every stage, ministers are dodging scrutiny and covering up for their own failures.”The government has made a series of pledges on testing over the period of the pandemic, including a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, and then at least 200,000 tests a day by the start of June. However, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, later said the latter figure would be judged against the capacity for tests, not the number conducted.The latest daily figures show that in the 24 hours to 9am on Sunday, 164,849 tests had been provided, with the testing capacity for the day at 294,258. These figures cover tests to see if people have coronavirus currently, as opposed to antibody tests which detect whether someone had Covid-19 in the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4191ae7083717f58208cfcf20a8a3b1493cc1c9e/1109_947_3213_1928/master/3213.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5544ef013231a78a7c822f5377e346c5","title":"my online business flourished the ethical brand that boomed when the high street shut down","story":"Kaela Mills had to shut her Bexhill childrenswear shop because of the coronavirus crisis, but she soon found success thanks to her savvy decision to expand her websiteWhen the government announced its lockdown measures for the UK, Kaela Mills felt decidedly gloomy about the future of her ethical childrenswear brand, Sprout. “When everything first started, I genuinely didn’t think my business was going to make it through,” she says. “Not knowing how long the lockdown was going to last was incredibly anxiety-inducing. I think a lot of small businesses felt the same.”Mills usually spends her days at The Workshop, Sprout’s retail space and the hub of production for her bright and playful made-to-order clothes. Just a few minutes’ walk from Bexhill beach, it started life as a shared workspace, but as Sprout quickly grew, she was able to dedicate the whole space to her own business.A place for creativity and connecting with customers, having to close the shop was a big blow. But, after a brief dip in sales just before lockdown, which she links to customers’ collective financial uncertainty, online sales soon began to rise. “Once lockdown started, because everyone was at home buying, my online business just flourished,” she says.Underpinning such a boost in online sales is Mills’ savvy decision to expand her website and ersify into other online marketplaces such as Etsy. Where she would once open the shop six days a week and make daily post runs, Mills was only able to manage twice-weekly trips to her workshop at the beginning of lockdown because she was juggling work and childcare. Postage was reduced to once a week. But the extra time proved just what she needed. “When I wasn’t able to get to my workshop and sew, I was spending a lot more time doing computer work, and that has had a hugely positive impact on the business now,” she says. “I’ve managed to do a lot of stuff that I’ve been meaning to do for years but literally not had the time!”As well as bolstering her online presence, Mills used lockdown to work on another long-held goal: expanding into womenswear. Her new line of made-to-measure women’s underwear, crafted from the same organic, colour-clash fabrics that make her childrenswear so popular, immediately became Sprout’s bestselling range.As well as her efforts in keeping the business alive and thriving during lockdown, Mills also credits consumers thinking more carefully about what and how they’re buying. “People have been looking at more sustainable ways of buying and my stuff is all organic – that’s why I thought it was important to go into doing some adult designs. Sales of my reusable products, such as reusable wipes and makeup pads, have also been huge,” she says.Sustainability is not just an extra selling point for Sprout, it’s something that has earned Mills a loyal community of like-minded customers. While face-to-face interaction has been impossible, Mills has found her brand’s Facebook group to be an essential source of positivity and communication, spotlighting it as one of her favourite aspects of the business. An 800-strong online community share photos of their “Sproutlets”, and buy and sell pre-loved Sprout items. The latter is something Mills is particularly proud of, as it’s proof in action of the longevity of her clothes. “You’ll see this pair of dungarees will be traced back through three or four different children,” she says. “That’s the whole point of my business. They last and they’re not disposable.”While the online side of the business has been booming and her community has prospered through social media, Mills is looking forward to the social interaction that her shop provides when she reopens. “People really love being able to see and feel the quality of the clothes, and it’s lovely when someone wanders in off the street, discovers my brand and becomes a regular customer,” she says.Opening with reduced hours at first, Mills believes it will take time for the high street to get back to where it was and is grateful for support from Visa’s shop local campaign. “It’s a real positive for such a huge brand to be supporting small businesses, it’s a bare essential to us,” she says.Those who venture on to their local high street and into Sprout’s workspace will gain a renewed connection between maker and consumer, as Mills makes each piece right there on the shop floor, an unusual sight when so much of clothing manufacturing happens overseas and behind closed doors. “When parents come in with their children, they’ll sit and watch me sew for a while. I think it’s important for children to know where their clothes are from, to see how it all works,” she says. “It’s been really weird working in here with the blinds down and the door locked. I’m looking forward to opening.”Shop local.

Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic. “We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Juggling a newly established business and a small child is a challenge. Add a global pandemic into this mix? “It was total chaos”, laughs Stephanie, who is currently staying on the Isle of Bute with her mother and daughter. They travelled there before any of the lockdown restrictions came into force so that her mother, who shares their flat in Edinburgh, could recover from a period of ill health, which included a week in intensive care.Until she is able to return to Edinburgh, Stephanie is handling ordering for the store remotely while Matthew keeps the shop doors open with the help of assistant Charlotte Wood.Yet despite the physical ide, they have worked together to adapt their business model as circumstances changed. As soon as the store’s local Post Office shut, for example, they stopped orders of lifestyle products through the website. They also reduced the store’s opening hours to manage deliveries and the extra cleaning now required.The couple are both qualified yoga instructors and have a studio at the back of the store. While the physical classes have had to come to an end for now, Matthew is managing to find time on Sundays to offer a Zoom class for their regular yogis who are still keen for their weekly fix.The lockdown has resulted in more positive innovations too. As well as introducing cargo bike deliveries, The Eco Larder now offers click-and-collect. “It’s a contactless service,” says Stephanie. “We leave the goods outside the shop for people. That’s been really popular now that lockdown is easing.”Stephanie is keen to highlight Matthew’s hard work over the last few months (“I’m really proud of him for everything he’s doing and showing up every single day”), but it is thanks to both of them that their business has done so well. “We never ran out of toilet roll,” says Stephanie with pride.The couple have also been able to draw on support from various sources. Thanks to an existing relationship with a walking and cycling charity, they were able to borrow two cargo bikes and find two volunteers to do their deliveries. Being part of the Visa network has helped too. “Having the support of bigger companies is necessary for smaller businesses,” says Stephanie. “They have the resources to raise the profile of a small business like ours.”The couple have been keen to give back to others, too. Rather than charging for their deliveries, they asked for a £5 donation and put a food box together every week, based on how many deliveries they had, and delivered it to the foodbank at Tollcross community hub, which is close to the shop.Looking to the future, Stephanie and Matthew would like to open another store in Edinburgh as this would expand their zero-waste mission and allow them to reduce prices. “Being the type of shop we are, it’s all small suppliers,” states Stephanie. “It’s just an issue of supply and demand. The more demand that there is, then the lower we can provide prices.Until that is possible, the couple are focused on buying their own cargo bike and offering deliveries on all weekdays, not just three days a week – so Matthew had better get more practice miles in on his next day off too.Shop local.

We are listening, noticing and looking much more,” she says. “Hopefully, people will continue to do these things now lockdown is easing, which can only benefit nature and our health.”Craig, who turned 18 in May, is thought to be the youngest person to have seen half of the world’s birds. Yet for the past three months, she has had to content herself with birdwatching on her doorstep, in the Chew Valley, south of Bristol, where she lives with her parents. “We have been really lucky as it is really beautiful here with lots of places to walk from our doorstep,” she says. Her mornings consist of school work done next to a window overlooking the birdfeeders or outside in the garden where she can watch the birds much closer. Afternoons are spent on birdwatching walks.“The highlights have been seeing 11 red kites above a field, a cuckoo calling from the woods above our house, and a red-necked phalarope at Chew Valley Lake, the first time that one has been seen there,” she says.But Craig is not just a birdwatcher: she’s also an activist, running nature camps for teenagers to introduce them to the natural world. With RSPB sites beginning to reopen, Craig is passionate that wildlife and nature should play a vital role in the nation’s mental health as lockdown eases.With new figures showing growing mental ill-health among young people, Craig believes connecting with nature is important as we are part of nature and need that connection to “relax, cope with anxiety and stay mentally and emotionally well”.For those without access to a garden or park, she says: “There are lots of things you can do to connect with nature through a window – such as watch the sunrise, listen to the dawn chorus, watch the clouds, watch the sunset or the night sky. You can plant herbs in a container and put them on a window ledge, put a birdfeeder and some water somewhere you can see them outside, or just watch any wildlife you can see in trees or bushes.”Young people from a black, Asian and minority-ethnic background are much less likely to live in rural areas, or have access to urban green spaces. And studies show that Covid-19 affects their mental health more than their white counterparts. Craig, who is part-Bangladeshi, is angry, though not surprised, at the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on non-white people, especially those of Bangladeshi heritage who have been dying at twice the rate of white people. “I think it is hugely worrying,” she says. “As a family, we have decided to carry on staying at home and my gran is going to carry on totally shielding.”While she recognises that there are some clinical and socio-economic factors behind these “shocking” statistics, Craig also believes “outright racism” plays a part - that Bangladeshis are too often perceived as “moaners” or “hypochondriacs”. “I have seen this with my grandmother, who is not taken seriously unless she has someone with her who will argue the case for treatment for her,” she says. “Lots of people don’t have an educated or confident family to do that for them.”Craig has been campaigning for years to improve ersity in conservation work. She got into nature because her parents are both keen birders and says that when she was 13 she noticed that there were hardly any other non-white faces on birdwatching trips. “Being part-Bangladeshi is what made me realise what a lack of ersity there was in the first place.”So in 2015, she set up a nature camp for 20 teenagers, and the seeds of her not-for-profit Black2Nature were born. So far, she has run nine camps for eight- to 11- and 12- to 19-year-olds. More than 200 children have taken part, and for some it’s the first time that they have seen a cow or sheep except on a plate. The aim of the camps is to encourage community cohesion as well as an introduction to the wonders of the natural world. It’s a “lot more than just birdwatching and mammal-watching”, she says.So what does she think of the Black Lives Matter movement? “It’s a really important campaign and one that those of us who are not black need to openly state our support for,” she says. “Black people are being killed and abused in the US and the UK, which needs to stop.“I think that we need new criminal laws for racially aggravated murder, attempted murder and assault. This needs to be supported with funding to support those being excluded from school and society.”Craig shared a platform with Greta Thunberg when she visited Bristol in February, and has organised conferences with the celebrity nature lovers Bill Oddie, Chris Packham and the RSPB chief executive, Beccy Speight. As one of the few non-white people in this field, she hopes she can be a role model. “It makes visible minority-ethnic young people think about nature and its possibilities when someone who looks like them is interested in it,” she says.Growing up, she travelled extensively and says she has “seen first-hand a lot of the impacts of climate change, deforestation and discrimination”, which gave her an interest in conservation and indigenous people.In 2021, she hopes to to volunteer with birds and indigenous people in the US before going to university to study politics and international relations. She also plans to run eight nature camps and hopes in the future the camps will be able to run without being reliant on her and to expand beyond Bristol.Locally, Craig says the pandemic lockdown has significantly improved the environment. “The disappearance of people and vehicles has halved pollution in Bristol city centre, regenerated our rivers and, with coal-powered stations shutting down, made our electricity carbon-free. All of these are great signs that we build on.”With her A-levels cancelled due to coronavirus, Craig plans to have August off to spend time with friends, and then go birding with her parents in Shetland and the Isles of Scilly in the autumn. Until then, she is still looking for birds in the Chew Valley and beyond.Family: Lives with her parents.Education: Chew Valley school plans to go to university in 2021.Public life: Founder and organiser, Black2Nature ambassador, Survival International, Tree Charter UK.Interests: Birdwatching, blogging, dance, guitar, vintage and second-hand shopping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b64eb8114c03066cded02f3c7aa6087455393c68/0_57_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4c508416189cdcb0ac922be049ac3688","title":"crickets new landscape could mean less is more for test matches","story":"Longest form of the game returns in England on Wednesday with the sport looking very different but with an opportunity to make some noise despite the silenceGreat news out of South Africa: 3 Team Cricket, the newest format of the game in which three teams play each other simultaneously, finally has a launch date. The inaugural 3TC event – featuring eight-man sides captained by AB de Villiers, Kagiso Rabada and Quinton de Kock – will be held at Pretoria’s SuperSport Park on 18 July.“I can’t think of a more appropriate day on which to hold this game than Nelson Mandela Day,” said Jacques Faul, chief executive of Cricket South Africa. And indeed, it’s possible this is exactly the utopian vision that sustained Mandela through his long years of incarceration: an end to apartheid, a free and democratic society, a novelty game where three teams take it in turns to bowl against each other in six-over segments.According to the conventional laws of internet cricket discourse, this is exactly the sort of thing people like me are supposed to hate: a perfect wedge issue upon which to enact cricket’s tiresome culture wars. Hey, I love two-team cricket as much as anyone, but there’s a financial reality out there. We need to appeal to the family market and all the research indicates women and children prefer their sporting contests in triplicate. It’s the way of the world.The more prosaic truth is that 3 Team Cricket strikes me as a rather intriguing experiment: a bespoke solution to the frequent problem of diminishing access to facilities and the difficulty of assembling 11-player teams at amateur level. Moreover, it feels a strangely fitting tribute to cricket’s timeless and restless adaptability that at the same time as embracing yet another new format, it is also welcoming back the very oldest.Yes: Test cricket is back. In a way, the Ageas Bowl is the perfect place to induct international cricket’s new post-pandemic era: a soulless bowl just off the M27 with its own two-mile biosecure radius from anywhere remotely interesting. Still, as England and West Indies face off for the first Test on Wednesday there will doubtless be plenty to ert us. The pace shootout between Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, Kemar Roach and Alzarri Joseph. Jason Holder and Ben Stokes – two of the world’s great all-rounders – going toe-to-toe. The sight of Joe Denly painstakingly making his way to 30 before, invariably, playing across a straight one.Naturally, there will be a note of dissonance too: the empty stands a reminder that this is essentially cold product, a contractual obligation, albeit one only made possible by the admirable cooperation of the tourists. For all the familiar rhythms that will resume on Wednesday morning, the celebratory mood, perhaps even the veneer of normality, these are strange and vividly uncertain times for the international game, which is, as ever, being squeezed between the rock of commerce and the hard place of protectionist self-interest.Take, by way of example, the context in which England v West Indies is putatively taking place: the cursed ICC World Test Championship, which has developed a considerable fixture backlog. With no prospect of clearing it before next summer’s Lord’s final, the options are either to truncate and render the whole tournament a farce or postpone and renegotiate the entire 2023-31 international calendar and rights cycle.The problem in both scenarios is the same one that has bedevilled international cricket for years: essentially, the most powerful nations will seize on the opportunity to chop out the bits of the calendar they don’t want. Bangladesh have had four series postponed. Cricket Australia has just pulled the plug on a one-day international series against Zimbabwe. The historic day-night Test against Afghanistan at Perth in November could be next.This is the fractious and fearful landscape into which international cricket returns and what is already certain is that the game that emerges from the pandemic will look very different from the one that entered it. With bilateral series becoming even less viable, international cricket could end up losing further ground to franchise T20 leagues. If this sounds like doomsday, then with a little imagination and foresight it need not be.The contraction of international cricket and overseas travel could end up reconnecting us with our long-neglected domestic clubs and leagues. Fresh ideas and innovations – yes, even 3 Team Cricket – could have room to flourish. “As the role of money diminishes,” the Zimbabwean cricket writer Tristan Holme observes in a fine Cricbuzz article, “the cultural value of contests will have a bigger say in determining what games get played.”What of Test cricket? Inevitably there will be less of it, but what remains may end up being more meaningful as a result. With the right promotion, the oldest and slowest form of the game may even be able to find its niche. Perhaps in a marketplace dominated by size, volume, noise and immediacy, a game that lasts for ages and is restricted to a few prestige fixtures will offer an irresistible point of difference.Maybe, on reflection, this is the break Test cricket has been waiting for: a chance to lean into its empty seats, make a virtue of its stillness, embrace the silence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f6f09a3b1c680a4477b4c2b6afd55819f8117a8/0_208_3153_1892/master/3153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc299a853ba8a681c46ab6130b640faf","title":"the big picture summer camp goodbyes","story":"Mark Steinmetz’s pre-Instagram pictures show American teenagers and children at camp experiencing their first taste of independenceFor about 10 years from 1986 Mark Steinmetz photographed children at American summer camps. He taught photography to the kids, but he also captured those moments when children discovered the strangeness and possibility of independence for the first time. Summers in bunk beds and cabins and woods stretched ahead of them, communal and lonely by turns. Part of the photographer’s motivation was to recapture the intensity of the periods he had spent away from his own family as a boy.His pictures are from different camps and different years but they share an emotional trajectory. The children arrive singly, clutching sleeping bags, they slowly overcome fears in ritualised games and campfire bonding, and they leave changed. In this picture the time away is coming to a close.

But as Steinmetz’s says: “Even if they’re miserable and bitching to one another throughout, by the end they’re like: ‘Oh my God, this is ending, you’re my best friend, and this has been the most intense thing I’ve ever done in my life!’”One of the things that strikes you most about these images – now collected in a book, Summer Camp – is how unselfconscious the children seem in the presence of the camera they don’t yet know all the angles. It is probably no coincidence Steinmetz gave up his project with the arrival of ubiquitous digital photography. He has persisted in working with film, and in black-and-white, over the years since because he “prefers the way film describes the light”. His summer camp pictures make that argument, which is less about nostalgia than a kind of emotional connection. “With digital,” Steinmetz has said, “every object in the frame seems slightly distinct and separate from every other element in the frame whereas silver prints have more internal harmony – they feel less nervous.” Summer Camp by Mark Steinmetz is published by Nazraeli Press (£50)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71cc3085ced5f58cbef2a8c99206ffd5f868e78e/459_615_4426_2656/master/4426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c42e061cda72388d6ea4366d260add4b","title":"which countries can uk holidaymakers visit without restrictions on arrival","story":"A guide to countries that UK tourists can now visit, in light of the government’s updated travel corridor listLast week, the government announced the countries that UK nationals could take holidays to without facing quarantine on return, also known as travel corridors. However, confusion remains over which countries Britons can visit without facing restrictions on arrival. Currently, this is 24 – out of the government’s list of 74.Many of the destinations on the list still have their own restrictions in place. Australia and New Zealand’s borders remain closed to international tourists and Austria, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Japan have restrictions on countries that have seen high levels of coronavirus, including the UK.On Friday, the Department for Transport (DfT) published its list of  travel corridors, with 74 countries (including 14 British overseas territories). Arrivals from this list of countries (both overseas tourists entering and UK nationals returning) will not face quarantine in England – although Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have yet to announce if and when they will lift the restrictions. In addition, the Foreign Office (FCO) updated its advice for a list of 67 countries it no longer considers high-risk, to allow for non-essential travel, although many of these countries still have their own restrictions or bans in place.Regardless of whether the UK government says it is safe to travel to a country, each destination has its own rules on who can enter. Some countries may not permit UK nationals to enter and they may ban anyone who has been in the UK in the previous 14 days. Security measures could also be in place at borders to prevent potential loopholes for passengers attempting to transit through other “safe” countries in order to dodge travel bans.Although there are now many destinations open to UK tourists without restrictions, some may still have health screening on arrival or an entry form to complete before leaving. Arrivals from the UK may also face restrictions if they have travelled to other countries in the 14 days prior. Countries not listed below may require testing on arrival, mandatory quarantine or have outright bans on arrivals from the UK. The situation is constantly changing and travel restrictions and quarantine measures could be subject to re-enforcement without notice.This article was first published on 6 July.

Ah. Ok. Nobody panic. What do we do? What’s the protocol here? Such are the anxieties of family holidays this summer.Incorporating social distancing into a hotel is tricky anywhere, but even harder in a property specifically aimed at families with young children. How do you work it when kids are running around, rolling on the floor and putting their hands all over everything?As we drive through manicured parkland towards Suffolk’s Ickworth Hotel, my two kids – aged four and six – are beside themselves with excitement after four months locked down at home. We are the third guests to arrive at the hotel, a wing of a grand Italianate stately home owned by the National Trust and leased by the Luxury Family Hotels group. General manager Faye Kelly is on the steps greeting everyone like it’s Christmas morning: “It’s going to be hard not to hug everyone!” she says, overjoyed after months without guests. She’s been living at the hotel three nights a week, trying to ignore the clips of The Shining sent to her by her siblings.The first indication of our brave new sanitised world is a sign on the front door requesting guests frequently wash their hands for a minimum of 20 seconds. Inside, we are directed to the first of numerous hand-gel stations for a welcome squirt.British hotels seem to be adopting differing approaches to how visible their new safety procedures should be. At Chewton Glen in Hampshire, for example, a masked staff member comes to your car to take your temperature before you’re allowed any further – but the Ickworth is going for what, at least on the outside, seems a more-relaxed regime. Staff are not wearing masks or gloves – there is PPE available, but it is their choice whether they wear it – and things look and feel relatively normal.There’s a narrow plastic screen across the reception desk (though the receptionist seems to always stand to one side). We are told the key has been left in the room, to reduce contact, but it isn’t quite ready – due to the extra anti-viral spraying necessary on the day of arrival (a procedure that avoids the need to strip out soft furnishings and paintings).While we wait, we stroll through high, glamorous corridors to the conservatory – where a fabulous hoya plant covers a pink wall – and settle in for afternoon tea, thrilled to be eating something I hadn’t made myself for the first time since March. My kids are wowed by their Beatrix Potter-themed trays featuring an edible garden and mini wheelbarrows full of chocolate eggs, dashing outside to play in the walled “fairy garden”. There, kids mix and share toys and climbing frames, which are deep-cleaned three times a day, while signs tell parents to ensure they wash hands before and afterwards.The conservatory now has six tables instead of the usual 13, and two more formal dining rooms have four, each spaced two metres apart. Only one other family and two couples share our grand dining room in the evening, but noisy kids, lovely waitresses and background music create enough of an atmosphere for us to really relax and enjoy fantastic plates of ricotta-stuffed tempura courgette flowers, baked halibut and a bottle of wine.All seems almost-normal to us, but for staff there’s a tension: the difficulty of standing back at dinner after a career of fussing over guests. Some guests will feel it odd that wine is left in the bucket rather than poured, others will see it as a sign of extra thought, and care.For now, the creche, swimming pool and spa remain closed, but a games room with table-tennis and table football is open, and cleaned hourly a cinema room with well-spaced seats shows films. Kids’ activities twice a day are now largely outdoors, though ours try a play dough-making session inside, with doors open to promote air flow, and the tutor standing well back, leaving supplies on tables.Guests can easily avoid others, spending their days in the surrounding 728 hectares (1,800 acres) of National Trust parkland, exploring a glorious network of woodland bike trails on borrowed bikes, and get free access to the stately home’s beautiful gardens. The hotel has its own lovely gardens too, where we encounter a baby deer among the roses after breakfast.There are tables spread out on the lawn for lunch, but we go one better, ordering one of the hotel’s pre-prepared picnics. We find it laid out in an adjacent field: blankets and cushions on the grass, a proper wicker basket of plates and glasses, mounds of sandwiches, strawberries and cream, even a baked camembert. Best of all, we have the field – bordered with ancient oaks to climb – to ourselves. Socially distanced dining at its most indulgent.•The trip was provided by The Ickworth (doubles from £109 B\u0026ampB), part of the Luxury Family Hotels group.

As a result, a steady stream of diseases can be expected to jump from animals to humans in coming years, they say.The number of such “zoonotic” epidemics is rising, from Ebola to Sars to West Nile virus and Rift Valley fever, with the root cause being the destruction of nature by humans and the growing demand for meat, the report says.The biggest economic costs fall on rich nations – $9tn (£7.2tn) for Covid-19 over two years, according to the IMF’s chief economist. This makes a very good case for investment in the countries where diseases emerge, the authors say.The report said a “one health” approach that unites human, animal and environmental health is vital, including much more surveillance and research on disease threats and the food systems that carry them to people.“There has been so much response to Covid-19 but much of it has treated it as a medical challenge or an economic shock,” said Prof Delia Grace, the lead author of the report by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) and the International Livestock Research Institute (Ilri).“But its origins are in the environment, food systems and animal health. This is a lot like having somebody sick and treating only the symptoms and not treating the underlying cause, and there are many other zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential.”“The science is clear that if we keep exploiting wildlife and destroying our ecosystems, then we can expect to see a steady stream of these diseases jumping from animals to humans in the years ahead,” said Andersen.Wildlife and livestock are the source of most viruses infecting humans and the report cites a series of drivers of outbreaks, including rising demand for animal protein, more intensive and unsustainable farming, greater exploitation of wildlife, surging global travel and the climate crisis. It also says many farmers, regions and nations are reluctant to declare outbreaks for fear of damaging trade.“The primary risks for future spillover of zoonotic diseases are deforestation of tropical environments and large-scale industrial farming of animals, specifically pigs and chickens at high density,” says the disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie of Emory University in the US, an expert reviewer of the report. “We are at a crisis point. If we don’t radically change our attitudes toward the natural world, things are going to get much, much worse. What we are experiencing now will seem mild by comparison.”The report highlights some examples of where zoonotic risks are being managed. In Uganda, deaths from Rift Valley fever have been reduced by using satellite data to anticipate heavy rainfall events, which can produce mosquito swarms and trigger outbreaks.The report is the latest stark warning that governments must address the destruction of the natural world to prevent future pandemics. In June, a leading economist and the UN said the coronavirus pandemic was an “SOS signal for the human enterprise”, while in April, the world’s leading bioersity experts said more deadly disease outbreaks were likely unless nature was protected.“At the heart of our response to zoonoses and the other challenges humanity faces should be the simple idea that the health of humanity depends on the health of the planet and the health of other species,” said Andersen. “If humanity gives nature a chance to breathe, it will be our greatest ally as we seek to build a fairer, greener and safer world for everyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9db277a013f70bef1f6a6c779834d14928231497/0_0_2987_1793/master/2987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc3b6bc560e9f45309ebc7e04a8fc30","title":"exiled uighurs call on icc to investigate chinese genocide in xinjiang","story":"Activist group submits evidence to international court accusing Xi Jinping and other Beijing officials of crimes against humanityA group of Uighurs in exile has submitted evidence to the international criminal court, calling for an investigation into senior Chinese officials, including Xi Jinping, for genocide and crimes against humanity.The submission made on Monday by lawyers based in London on behalf of two activists groups marks the first time advocates have attempted to use international law against China over allegations of widespread human rights violations in Xinjiang, the far north-western territory of China where Uighur and other minority groups are detained and surveilled en masse.The filing, submitted on behalf of the “east Turkistan government in exile and the East Turkistan national awakening movement”, claims that Uighurs were unlawfully deported from Tajikistan and Cambodia to Xinjiang where they were subjected to imprisonment, torture as well as forced birth control, sterilisations and marriages among other crimes.The lawyers argue that because part of these crimes took place in Cambodia and Tajikistan, signatories to the Rome statute that established the ICC, the court has jurisdiction over these cases even though China is not a member of the court.The argument is based on ICC decisions in 2018 and 2019 that it had jurisdiction to investigate crimes committed against the Rohingya by officials in Myanmar, which is not a party to the court, because some of the alleged violations took place in Bangladesh, a signatory to the court.Rodney Dixon QC, one of the lawyers who made the submission said: “For too long it was assumed that nothing could be done by the world’s criminal court. There is now a clear legal pathway to justice for the millions of Uighurs who are allegedly being persecuted by the Chinese authorities... This chance should not be squandered.”A growing body of evidence including witness accounts, satellite imagery and leaked government orders documenting the large-scale detention and control over Uighurs in Xinjiang, has caused condemnation of Beijing’s policies. But the international community has not been able to sanction China, which claims its programmes in Xinjiang are its own “internal affairs” and carried out in the name of security.The filing urges the court to investigate crimes committed against Uighurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Turkic peoples including disappearances, mass internment, forced transfer of children from their families to state orphanages, measures to eliminate Turkic languages, mass surveillance and other crimes.The submission includes the names of senior Chinese officials, including president Xi Jinping, who should be charged for planning and directing the campaign.“The Chinese government has conducted a campaign to round up Uighurs abroad and who have fled east Turkistan as a result of the crimes committed against them in China,” the groups said in a statement, referring to the traditional name of the region and its title as an independent state between 1944 and 1949.“The Uyghur and the other Turkic peoples of east Turkistan deserve justice for the atrocities that are being committed against them by the Chinese government every day. We are hopeful that Justice will prevail,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953f1e9a76db378e1401094fe09d313b5e5528c4/0_124_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1456802916b73dc469833259d3d3d752","title":"global report south africa cases pass 200000 as kenya plans phased reopening","story":"South Africa is the worst-affected African nation Australian state of Victoria sees spike in community transmission US daily cases drop below 50,000Latest coronavirus updatesWhite House says it is a leader in the fight against Covid-19South Africa’s coronavirus cases have passed 200,000, the highest total in Africa, as Kenya’s leadership announced that it was pressing on with plans to ease the country’s lockdown despite a steep increase in cases.There are currently 205,721 cases and 3,310 deaths in South Africa, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which relies on official government data, making it the 15th worst-affected country worldwide.South Africa’s Times newspaper reported that the country’s cases have increased by almost 160,000 in the last month alone.Despite imposing some of the strictest lockdown measures worldwide in late March, South Africa on Saturday reported more than 10,000 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily jump on record for the country. Lockdown measures are gradually being eased.The government in Gauteng province, home to Johannesburg, has asked the government to reimpose hard lockdown, but on Friday president Cyril Ramaphosa told media that there were no plans to move back into stricter lockdown.Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, on Monday announced a “phased reopening” of the country, with the resumption of international flights from 1 August as well as the lifting of internal travel restrictions.The move comes as pressure mounts to kickstart the country’s ailing economy after nearly four months of coronavirus restrictions that have devastated key industries such as tourism. Kenyatta said in a televised address that “international air travel into and out of the territory of Kenya shall resume effective 1 August 2020.”The Democratic Republic of Congo has extended its coronavirus health emergency on for 15 days, the sixth extension since March, with some lawmakers voicing concern about the effect on the economy. Officials lifted the ban on internal flights last week, but all other measures remain in place in a country that has recorded 182 deaths from 7,432 infections.Flights in New Zealand will be limited as the government seeks to ease pressure on its quarantine regime – international arrivals are quarantined for 14 days to ensure Covid-19 does not enter the community – by rationing the return of citizens to the country. Jacinda Ardern’s government has struck a deal with Air New Zealand to limit the number of places available for international arrivals, given the strain on compulsory isolation facilities.Australia’s fight against a new outbreak of the virus in Victoria continued, as 191 new cases were confirmed, breaking yesterday’s record for the state of 127 new cases in a single day. The state government was reported to be considering a month-long lockdown centred on the capital, Melbourne.Cases continue to soar in the United States as the country’s total – the worst worldwide – approaches 3 million, more than a quarter of the global total. The US death toll passed 130,000 on Monday.Globally, there are 11,592,259 known cases and 537,487 deaths.Hospital beds are full in parts of Texas, while calls for fresh stay-at-home orders are growing.

Woods said she was talking to other airlines “about managing flows”.The move will be contentious, as New Zealand’s bill of rights gives citizens the right to enter and leave New Zealand.Like Australia, New Zealand is one of a handful of countries worldwide attempting to quarantine international arrivals for 14 days to ensure Covid-19 does not enter the community.To do this, the government has set up “managed isolation” hotels for new arrivals, with anyone testing positive moved to a “quarantine” hotel until they are free of the deadly virus.New Zealand has not had a case of community transmission in more than two months, even as worldwide cases balloon to over 11 million. The border controls are the only restriction remaining in New Zealand, which did away with curbs on groups gathering last month.The New Zealand government is footing the bill for the quarantine regime, which currently involves 28 hotels and is budgeted to cost around $NZ300m this year.Woods says the government is currently housing almost 6,000 people and something has to give. “The last thing we need are hastily set up facilities to meet demand, so we must have a manageable number of fit-for-purpose, safe facilities that do the job of stopping covid at the border,” Woods said.Last month, defence force personnel were drafted in to help lead the logistical challenge. Air Commodore Darryn Webb said they were “scaling up more spaces all the time, but we need to do so safely and new facilities need to be watertight before they are opened”.“Standing up new capacity at the required levels for people to stay in for 14 days of isolation is a hugely complex undertaking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/880cdfc012b949762d7eb11a7d1cb198811c2bbc/0_197_5903_3542/master/5903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a68709b03697d159808b641907840bd0","title":"refusal to wear mask should be as taboo as drink driving says royal society chief","story":"President of science body issues call amid evidence coverings protect wearer as well as othersRefusing to wear a mask in public during the Covid-19 epidemic should become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving or not wearing a seatbelt, the president of the Royal Society has said.He spoke as new research emerges suggesting the UK’s uptake of the practice is way behind that of other countries and that face coverings can protect the wearer as well as people around them.Venki Ramakrishnan called for everyone to be required to wear a mask in all indoor public settings, rather than only on public transport, and criticised confused messaging from the government.The head of the UK’s national academy of sciences spoke as two reports explored the effectiveness of masks. One, which updates work carried out by Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (DELVE), a multi-disciplinary group convened by the Royal Society, uncovered evidence that they could reduce the risk of transmission, providing benefits to the wearer as well as people around them. The other by the Royal Society’s Science in Emergencies Tasking Covid-19 group, published jointly by the British Academy and the Royal Society, highlighted how far the UK is trailing behind other countries.Ramakrishnan said: “Wearing a mask did not bother our Italian, French or Spanish neighbours none of whom were used to wearing one before the pandemic, yet now do so routinely.“So just treat it as another item of clothing that is part of the new normal and wear it whenever you cannot socially distance safely. It is the right thing to do, and a small price to pay, to help keep infections down and the economy open in the pandemic.”Ramakrishnan added that many people were even ignoring the requirement to wear masks on public transport.“The message has not been clear enough, so perhaps people do not really understand the benefits or are not convinced of them. Whatever the reasons, we need to overcome our reservations and wear face coverings whenever we are around others in public.“It used to be quite normal to have quite a few drinks and drive home, and it also used to be normal to drive without seatbelts. Today, both of those would be considered antisocial, and not wearing face coverings in public should be regarded in the same way.“If all of us wear one, we protect each other and thereby ourselves, reducing transmission. We lower the chances of future surges and lockdowns which are economically and psychologically disruptive, and we increase the chance of eliminating the virus. Not doing so increases the risk for everyone, from NHS workers to your grandmother.”Last month both the World Health Organisation and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US issued updated guidance recommending that everyone wear face masks in public areas where there is a risk of transmission of Covid-19, to help reduce the spread of the disease.

We are slowly getting through our list of customers that were in the pub on Saturday. All our staff are going to be tested and we will reopen when the time is safe to do so.”Also in Burnham, the Indian takeaway Saagar said it would be closing until Friday to undergo a deep clean after one of its drivers had been to the Lighthouse Kitchen, along with the Vape Escape bar, which has also closed for a full clean after a customer’s positive test.Leanne Underhill, the owner of the Vape Escape, said all staff tests had been negative and customers in the bar on Saturday had been contacted, in accordance with government advice.Somerset county council say they are not treating the cases as an “outbreak” and asked people to keep to social distancing guidelines and to regularly wash their hands. The Fox and Hounds in Batley, West Yorkshire, said it would be closed until further notice after receiving a call from a customer on Monday to say they had tested positive for coronavirus.In a statement, it added: “The pub will be fully deep cleaned and when safe to do so we will reopen our doors. We fully understand this is a scary time but want to ensure our customer safety is our main priority in these tough times.“Over the past few weeks we have put a lot of hard work into the pub following government guidance to get us opened back up. Anyone that has visited us this weekend can see our new layout of tables of 1-metre-plus, our one-way systems, full table service and continuous cleaning throughout.”The Village Home pub in Alverstoke near Gosport, Hampshire, said it had also had a case of coronavirus, adding that “some of us are in isolation”.Its statement said: “The pub is now shut but all being well will open again on Saturday. Anyone who was in the pub over the weekend there is no need to isolate unless you show symptoms or are contacted direct by the trace group. Thank you and hope to see you soon.”All three pubs had previously posted about implementing new social distancing and safety guidelines in line with government advice.Under the measures, pubs can offer only table service, and customers must give contact details upon entry.UK pub and hospitality trade bodies have also published guidance for bars and restaurants on how to operate contact tracing. Contact details need only to be taken from one person in a group and must be kept for 21 days. Owners are also asked to note the arrival times of customers and how long they stay. People can refuse to give information, but owners can choose not to serve them. Tens of thousands of people flocked to pubs across England on Saturday as pubs and restaurants reopened. There were a number of arrests but police said a majority of people had acted responsibly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d0906c1bcea2c9ab2abb7f15f07ea2c0c3cbea/0_219_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6778e50da57654efb3f7134b53f3af07","title":"leicester how have you been affected by the local lockdown","story":"We want to hear from people living in Leicester about how restrictions are affecting themLeicester is the first city to experience a local lockdown with non-essential shops and schools closed from Tuesday.Restrictions are set to be in place for two weeks after infections rose, with Leicester accounting for around one in 10 of all coronavirus cases in the past week.We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences.

She examines how housing pressures, in-work poverty and racial inequalities contributed to the deaths of 36 residents from Covid-19 journalist Aamna Modhin tells Rachel Humphreys about reporting from Church End, a small neighbourhood in Brent, north London, which has a large Somali population. In early March, residents began to fall ill from coronavirus, eventually resulting in 36 deaths. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby.  Aamna met Rhoda Ibrahim, a 57-year old community leader who has been left devastated by the deaths of so many people she knew. The virus thrived on the structural inequalities that Ibrahim has spent much of her life fighting against. It flourished in a housing crisis that was 40 years in the making, stark in-work poverty that left many struggling to put food on the table, and deeply entrenched racial inequalities. The council leader, Muhammed Butt, believes the government’s failure to provide tailored support to communities such as those in Brent worsened the situation, and that the country should have gone into lockdown earlier.

She has summed it up below. Coronavirus deaths have declined to their lowest levels since late March, with 606 fatalities registered in England and Wales in the week ending 26 June, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics.More analysis from the ONS on coronavirus deaths. Every week the ONS has been charting the tragic death toll of the coronavirus pandemic. As we pass the midway point in the year, Sarah Caul looks back on what has happened so far in 2020 and, using trends from previous years, gives her view on what could happen next.Of the three scenarios she sketches out for the remainder of 2020, Caul says a second peak of COVID-19 could return death registrations above the five-year average. In 19181919, the ‘Spanish flu’ had three separate waves, of which the second wave peaked much higher than the first. Multiple waves of COVID-19 could cause the number of death registrations to rise back above the five-year average. It is too early to tell if there will be another wave of COVID-19, and if there is another wave, whether this would be relatively soon, or in the winter months of 2020-21 when we would usually start to see higher levels of influenza and pneumonia.Another issue to be considered is the effect of the lockdown period on health for the rest of 2020, and into next year. We have already seen some signs of increased mortality that are potentially caused by delayed access to healthcare services. There could also be increases in mortality which have already occurred but the deaths have not yet been registered, as some causes of death take longer to confirm than others. Examples of these are deaths due to suicide, substance abuse and domestic violence, all of which may have been expected to increase during lockdown.In the longer term, the economic downturn is also likely to have health effects. On the other hand, it has been suggested that there could be some beneficial health effects of the lockdown period, for example from reduced air pollution and work accidents.”New research shows that half of British workers do not want to go back to pre-Covid working environments.As workplaces reopen, a quarter of Britons say their employer hasn’t explored any flexible working options to help them return to work.The nationally representative survey from Theta Financial Reporting suggests neither the government nor large businesses have done enough to consult the workforce on how safe they feel to return to work and whether the traditional environment works for them in a post-Covid world. The ONS has released its figures for deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 26 June, including a comparison of different data sources for Covid-19-related deaths in England and Wales, with a date of death up to and including 26 June.The Office for National Statistics has released new data on infections in the community in England for July.Charities and politicians have raised concerns that children whose parents lose their jobs over the summer holidays won’t be able to access the free school meal voucher scheme. Schools must order the vouchers at least one week before the school terms ends. In a written answer to a prime minister’s question from Labour, the government said that if a school receives a claim for an eligible child during the final week before the school’s summer holidays, it will be possible for the school to place an “exceptional order” for that child. But, the response went on: “The completion of orders by the end of term reflects the fact that school staff will break for the summer. The government has made significant wider support available for children and families at this time.”Tulip Siddiq, the shadow minister for children and early years, said: Many more people could sadly lose their jobs over the summer holidays as the economic impact of Covid-19 starts to bite, and we are concerned that their children won’t be able to access free school meal support.Most schools are under huge pressure to get applications in for the Covid summer food fund before the arbitrary deadline of 10 July. The fact that the guidance on eligibility was incorrect for nearly a full week has not helped, and there are fears that some children could miss out as a result of poor communication.Ministers need to start thinking ahead about problems they will need to address in the future, rather than always scrambling to withdraw support and introduce limitations at the earliest possible opportunity.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “We are very pleased the government has recognised the plight of desperate families during the coronavirus emergency by extending the free school meal vouchers scheme over the summer holidays. “It is obviously a matter of great concern that more families are likely to lose jobs over the holiday period itself, and that they won’t be able to access this scheme because they will be beyond the effective cut-off point. We would welcome any suggestions about how this issue might be addressed.”The former chancellor Philip Hammond has said his successor must be prepared to let some businesses fail.Rishi Sunak is due to announce fiscal measures designed to aid the UK’s economic recovery after the coronavirus crisis on Wednesday.Hammond told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Sunak faced an extraordinarily complex challenge.“He’ll want to continue to support businesses and people who are affected by regulatory shutdown in what are otherwise viable businesses. But he will also sadly need to facilitate a transition for those businesses and people who are, what they are doing is no longer viable.“Some businesses will close, some viable businesses will close units – we have already heard the announcement of retailers closing stores – and that’s where a focus on retraining and reskilling, getting people turned around and ready to go back into the workforce as quickly as possible, will come into it.”Ministers have defended the prime minister over his comments seeming to put the responsibility for coronavirus outbreaks in care homes on to the social care sector.Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, the business secretary, Alok Sharma, said the prime minister was “certainly not blaming care homes” for social care coronavirus deaths in comments Johnson made on Monday.Sharma said: “Specifically on the point the prime minister was making yesterday, I think what he was actually pointing out is that nobody knew what the correct procedures were at the time because, quite frankly, we didn’t know what the extent of asymptomatic transmission was. That wasn’t known at the time.“We then put in place very detailed action plans for care homes, we made sure there was a rigorous testing regime put in place, and we also ensured there was extra money – there was £600m that went in as part of an infection control fund. So we have supported the sector throughout.”When it was put to him that Boris Johnson had criticised care homes for not following the set procedures, Sharma said: “The prime minister is certainly not blaming care homes.”He praised the “really brilliant job” done by carers during the pandemic and recognised that they had carried out their work in “difficult circumstances”.Here’s the background for Adams’ comments:Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Mark Adams, the chief executive of charity Community Integrated Care, said he was “unbelievably disappointed” to hear the prime minister’s comments about the actions of care homes during the coronavirus crisis. He said: I think this, at best, was clumsy and cowardly, but to be honest with you, if this is genuinely his view, I think we’re almost entering an ... alternative reality where the government set the rules, we follow them and they don’t like the results and they then deny setting the rules and blame the people that were trying to do their best. It is hugely frustrating.When asked to explain why he called Boris Johnson’s words “cowardly”, Adams added: Because you’ve got 1.6 million social care workers who, when most of us are locked away in our bunkers waiting out Covid, really trying to protect our family, we’ve got these brave people on minimum wage, often with no sickness cover at all, going into work to protect our parents, our grandparents, our children, putting their own health and potentially their own lives at risk.And then to get the most senior man in the country turning round and blaming on them what has been an absolute travesty of leadership from the government, I just think it is appalling.He said the care sector had been “crying out” for weekly testing for months.I think what we’re getting is history rewritten in front of us, when you could list pages and pages of government failure which the system has had to cope with.And to get a throwaway comment, almost glibly blaming the social care system and not holding your hand up for starting too late, doing the wrong things, making mistake after mistake, is just frankly unacceptable.New research suggests the UK’s uptake of protective masks is way behind that of other countries – and that face coverings can protect the wearer as well as people around them.Kevin Rawlinson reports that refusing to wear a mask in public during the Covid-19 pandemic should become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving or not wearing a seatbelt, the president of the Royal Society has said.Venki Ramakrishnan called for everyone to be required to wear a mask in all indoor public settings, rather than only on public transport, and criticised confused messaging from the government.Alex Hern is reporting that nearly one in six Britons will refuse a coronavirus vaccine if and when one becomes available, and a similar number are unsure whether they will get one, according to a survey.The findings come amid a significant rise in anti-vaccination sentiment on social media, and represent a threat to efforts to contain the disease.Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a non-profit organisation that commissioned the research said: Our hope for a return to normal life rests with scientists developing a successful vaccine for coronavirus. But social media companies’ irresponsible decision to continue to publish anti-vaccine propaganda means a vaccine may not be effective in containing the virus. The price for their greed is a cost paid in lives.The arts world continues to celebrate after the chancellor’s £1.57bn bailout to save Britain’s arts and cultural institutions from collapse. The chancellor last night went further than expected with a massive package of financial support, including £880m in direct grant funding. The Treasury will also offer a further £270m in loans for arts organisations, £100m for national museums and English Heritage £120m for stalled heritage projects plus an extra £188m for the devolved administrations.But as Politico reports, some ergent voices are beginning to make themselves heard: the shadow culture secretary, Jo Stevens, told the Westminster Hour on Radio 4 last night she feared the promise of grant funding will have come too late for many arts organisations which have been teetering on the brink since mid-March. “We welcome, obviously, this injection of much-needed cash,” she said, “but I do wonder what took the government so long. They have known the problems in the sector for weeks and weeks and weeks, and for some areas and some organisations and theatres across the country, from north to south, it’s already too late – jobs have gone.”For example: the award-winning Nuffield Southampton Theatres shut down last week after collapsing into administration in May, ending more than 50 years of productions on the south coast. All 86 staff were made redundant last Thursday. The Indy’s Kate Devlin reports the organisations expected to be prioritised for grants are “the so-called ‘crown jewels’ of the British arts, culture and heritage industries, and those with special local or regional significance”.Good morning. This is Amelia Hill bringing you today’s UK coronavirus news.Boris Johnson last night caused anger among care leaders, unions and MPs after he accused care homes of failing to follow proper procedures amid the coronavirus crisis.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing a £3bn green package with grants for homeowners and public buildings to improve energy efficiency. Environmental groups have reacted with disappointment to details saying it does not go far enough. Sunak has Treasury questions in the Commons at 11.30am today.Meanwhile two grandees of the Thatcher era have urged the government to learn lessons from the mass unemployment of the 1980s in its response to the coronavirus pandemic."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Climate crisis and bioersity loss should be in one department \u0026ndash environment groupsProtestors scaling up action because Programme for Government not radical enough"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impact"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

At a briefing in Dublin, HSE chief executive Paul Reid described it as a “phenomenal achievement”.The app, developed by Waterford company Nearform, is primarily used for contact tracing, checking on symptoms daily and providing updates on Covid-19 in Ireland.Earlier, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said take-up of the HSE’s contact tracing app so far this morning has been “really good”.“This is a really good news story. This is a powerful tool in the fight against Covid,” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.The app provides every single person with an opportunity to assist in the fight against the virus, added the Minister. “Please take two minutes to download the app. It is totally private.”There is already a comprehensive testing-and-tracking service in place in Ireland but the app is “an extra tool” in the fight, Mr Donnelly said, although he warned it was not “a silver bullet”.The Minister said the privacy aspects of the app were impressive and that permission would be requested before any tracking measures were taken using the app. Everyone was in control of their own data, the information was anonymised, and there was no centralised database, he said.The app requires the latest versions of both Apple and Google’s software, which include the exposure notification tool upon which the app is built.If you are going to use contact tracing, you will need to enable bluetooth location services are not essential, and both Apple and Google previously said there would be no sharing of location data with the Covid tracker software. After installing it on both iOS and Android, neither required access to my location data, nor did they appear on the list of apps that had used location services in recent days. You will also be asked to allow the app to send you notifications.For the app to be effective as a way of tracing contacts, it requires other people to also download and use it, which is why the HSE is keen to have as many people as possible share the app.The app also asks for permission to collect app metrics, or data on how the app is being used. According to the terms and conditions, that includes if the app on your phone is being used, if exposure notification services have been turned on and if the app has received any exposure notifications. None of the permissions are essential to the working of the app, so you can refuse consent in the first instance or go back and disable them in the in-app settings.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Tool is \u0026lsquototally private\u0026rsquo says Minister for HealthMan has appeared in court charged with four offences related to the incidentMost pubs in Dublin\u0026rsquos nightlife district have stayed closed and may not open on July 20thBelfast City Council apologises for \u0026lsquoerror of judgment\u0026rsquo over funeralAsylum-seeker \u0026lsquosadness\u0026rsquo often compounded by isolation from school peers outside townsCovid-19 Oireachtas committee told special schools face challenges restartingUse of n-word and exclusion by teachers and other students widespread, report findsDublin water supply again on a knife-edge as situation \u0026lsquoworse than the 2018 drought\u0026rsquoNumber of people threatened by poor water supplies doubles due to issues at Leixlip plantSurvey of research papers shows promising results on alleviating some anxiety disordersHe made a commitment in opposition to set up an ex-gratia payment systemGenetic mix of bacteria and other microbes in the gut reduces risk of certain diseasesMinister to make D\u0026aacuteil statement after being disqualified from driving for three monthsA number of fake social media pages using Noah\u0026rsquos name have been seeking informationPubs that flout Covid-19 restrictions will not be allowed to use tables and barrels outdoorsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4297770.1594071141!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in suspends party activity in dublin sw following holohan mayor nomination","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn January, Paddy Holohan made headlines after he questioned Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s links to Ireland because of his Indian ancestry, and then made a series of highly-criticised remarks about women.

Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 may not have originated china elsewhere emerged asia","story":"Coronavirus may have lain dormant across the world and emerged when the environmental conditions were right for it to thrive rather than starting in China, an Oxford University expert believes.Dr Tom Jefferson, senior associate tutor at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), at Oxford and a visiting professor at Newcastle University,  argues there is growing evidence that the virus was elsewhere before it emerged in Asia.Last week, Spanish virologists announced that they had found traces of the disease in samples of waste water collected in March 2019, nine months before coronavirus was seen in China.Italian scientists have also found evidence of coronavirus in sewage samples in Milan and Turin in mid-December, many weeks before the first case was detected, while experts have found evidence of traces in Brazil in November.Dr Jefferson believes many viruses lie dormant throughout the globe and emerge when conditions are favourable, which also means they can vanish as quickly as they arrive.Where did Sars 1 go? It\u0027s just disappeared, he said. So we have to think about these things. We need to start researching the ecology of the virus, understanding how it originates and mutates.I think the virus was already here – here meaning everywhere. We may be seeing a dormant virus that has been activated by environmental conditions. There was a case in the Falkland Islands in early February. Now where did that come from? There was a cruise ship that went from South Georgia to Buenos Aires, and the passengers were screened and then on day eight, when they started sailing towards the Weddell Sea, they got the first case. Was it in prepared food that was defrosted and activated? Strange things like this happened with Spanish Flu. In 1918, around 30 per cent of the population of Western Samoa died of Spanish Flu, and they hadn\u0027t had any communication with the outside world.The explanation for this could only be that these agents don\u0027t come or go anywhere. They are always here and something ignites them, maybe human density or environmental conditions, and this is what we should be looking for.Dr Jefferson believes the virus may be transmitted through the sewage system or shared toilet facilities, not just through droplets expelled by talking, coughing and sneezing.Writing in The , Dr Jefferson and Professor Carl Henegehan, director of the CEBM, call for an in-depth investigation similar to that carried out by John Snow in 1854 to show that cholera was spreading in London from an infected well in Soho.Exploring why so many outbreaks happen at food factories and meat-packing plants could uncover major new transmission routes, they believe. It may be shared toilet facilities, coupled with cool conditions, that allow the virus to thrive.We\u0027re doing a living review, extracting environmental conditions, the ecology of these viruses which has been grossly understudied, said Dr Jefferson.There is quite a lot of evidence that huge amounts of the virus were in sewage all over the place, and an increasing amount of evidence there is faecal transmission. There is a high concentration where sewage is four degrees, which is the ideal temperature for it to be stabled and presumably activated. And meat-packing plants are often at four degrees.These meat-packing clusters and isolated outbreaks don\u0027t fit with respiratory theory, they fit with people who haven\u0027t washed their hands properly. These outbreaks need to be investigated properly with people on the ground one by one. You need to do what John Snow did. You question people and you start constructing hypotheses that fit the facts, not the other way around.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain faces tsunami unemployment","story":"It was good to see so many young people celebrating Super Saturday at the weekend. But this was not Britain springing back to life or a return to normality. The young may have been out and about but many older people remained at home. Not all pubs and restaurants reopened, and those that did were often operating at well below normal levels.There has been a lot of debate about which letter of the alphabet will best describe Britain’s economic recovery when it happens: V, L or U? The chief economist at the Bank of England says the data indicate a V-shaped recovery. There are also hopeful signs internationally. In the US, a record 2.7 million jobs were added in May. What was forgotten was that the US shed more than 20 million jobs in April.Here in the UK, there may be some firms that enjoy a V-shaped recovery. Others, in hospitality, aviation or on the high street, face a mountain to climb. So we may find ourselves with an economy that gets back to 90 per cent of where it was before, but with that 10 per cent gap having a continuing depressing effect. Already a number of well-known names have gone bankrupt. Many more will follow, including small firms discovering that they can’t repay debts run up during lockdown. Defaults on loans will hit the banks and their ability to lend.The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will deliver an economic update on Wednesday, including details of his recovery package. What should he announce for this unprecedently difficult situation?He will no doubt confirm the Government’s commitment to large increases in infrastructure spending. That is welcome but infrastructure projects are rarely “shovel ready” and will do little for the most pressing problem: the imminent threat of a tsunami of unemployment.The furlough scheme has been hugely successful in taking 9.3 million off the unemployment register. But how many millions will find they still have jobs when the scheme ends in October? Some fear unemployment could rise to 3 or 4 million. Mervyn King, the former Bank of England governor, has suggested the scheme should continue. But that would be extremely expensive and give the wrong sort of incentive. We are paying people not to work when we should be paying to get them back into work.The best way to encourage employment is to reduce the cost of employing people. The tax cut we need is the temporary abolition or reduction of Employers’ National Insurance Contributions, perhaps limited to particular sectors. An alternative would be direct cash payments to firms to maintain or increase employment. If we don’t act, the worst hit will be the young. This year’s school leavers could be next year’s long-term unemployed. They will need support with training, apprenticeships and advice.Some would argue the priority should not be to protect existing jobs but to create new jobs in industries of the future. But governments do not create jobs, businesses do. What was created by the Government was the lockdown that led to the recession. There are many job losses and bankruptcies that would not have happened but for the Government’s action. So the Government has a moral obligation to those whose problems it created. As long as the restrictions on business continue, the Government should continue its support.Others argue for a temporary cut in VAT to bring forward spending. But that is prohibitively expensive: each percentage point costs £6.8 billion a year and the small change in shop prices would hardly be noticed.Tomorrow is not a Budget and there are constraints on what the Chancellor can announce. A cut in stamp duty would help to stimulate the housing market but that will probably have to wait until the November Budget. Further, the best way of getting a V-shaped recovery – the lifting of all restrictions – is not in Mr Sunak’s gift. Any repeat of lockdown would be disastrous and even local lockdowns risk damaging business confidence.Nevertheless, extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. We need to move beyond the recovery stage to long-term expansion led by the private sector. The Government should set the framework, forget all about a so-called industrial strategy and let the private sector create prosperity for the whole country.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 7th july 2020","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson looks through a large bore pipe during a visit to the Siemens Rail factory construction site in Goole, England. Coronavirus latest news: Melbourne goes into six week lockdown as cases surgeEx-Labour MP Eric Joyce facing jail over indecent photograph of childComment: London is still a ghost town, when it needs to get back to businessPolitics latest news: Prime Minister under pressure to apologise over \u0026#39cowardly\u0026#39 care homes commentsTravel latest: No refund if local lockdown ruins your holiday, Britons warnedEU \u0026#39ready\u0026#39 for full Brexit border checks next year, Barnier claimsJohnny Depp arrives at High Court for first day of libel case over \u0026#39wife beating\u0026#39 story Bastille Day 2020: how a prison riot and the Tennis Court Oath overthrew the Bourbon monarchyComment: We must not lose sight of the vital role free trade can play in our recoveryHalle Berry apologises for comments on transgender roleArctic Siberia saw exceptionally high temperatures as global warmth matched last year\u0026#39s record levels for JuneAustralia reimposes Melbourne lockdown for six weeks The Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayCoronavirus world round-up: Australia\u0026#39s second largest city returns to lockdown as Beijing reports no new deathsLeicester lockdown map: What areas are included, and what are the rules?Scotland\u0026#39s largest airport attacks SNP \u0026#39dithering\u0026#39 as summer holiday plans left in limboComment: How I very nearly failed the simple Covid testJapan\u0026#39s death toll from severe flooding reaches 50Neanderthal gene linked to fatal form of coronavirusBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/24/16/coronavirus-lockdown-internet-use.jpg","title":"coronavirus internet use uk lockdown facebook google","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027Lockdown\u0026nbspmay leave a lasting digital legacy,\u0027 says Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and researchPeople in the UK have been spending record amounts of time on the internet during the coronavirus lockdown, new data has revealed.In April 2020, UK adults spent longer than four hours online each day – more than a quarter of their waking life.It marks an increase of more than half an hour since January and means people now spend substantially more time online than watching television or listening to the radio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures were revealed in Ofcom’s Online Nation report, which detailed the habits and trends of internet users between November 2019 and April 2020.People aged 18 to 24 were the most heavy users, clocking an average of more than five hours spent online per day.A large portion of the study focussed on internet habits in 2019, which revealed that technology giants now control an even greater share of internet traffic.The research by the regulator showed that more than a third of time spent online was spent on sites owned by either Facebook or Google.The shift towards platforms like Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger appears to have been accelerated during lockdown, with nearly half of all adults using the messaging apps to make video calls at least once a week.Data shows Trump is wrong about US doing more Covid-19 testingOfcom\u0027s research found that the use of video calling services doubled to 70 per cent of the population during the lockdown, as people sought new ways to stay in touch.One of the biggest benefiters from this trend has been the app Zoom, which saw a huge surge in new users at the start of the lockdown.Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy, said Yij-Choung Teh, Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and research.Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That relies on a steady stream of new business to keep it going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Post-production is a bit like an airline: if you haven’t got any passengers, you burn through your cash very quickly – most companies will struggle to stay solvent for more than a couple of months.”Last week, French visual effects studio Technicolour SA filed for Chapter 15 in US bankruptcy court in an effort to restructure some of its £1.26bn debt, as per Deadline. In the filing, the company acknowledged that it had been “severely impacted by the Covid-19 global pandemic”.I May Destroy You shows how seamlessly phones dictate our existenceThe arts are an essential service – as vital as health and defenceWhy Marvel comics are perfect for video games – but wrong for cinemaSlow said that Pixomondo, which provided the graphics for the dragons in the hit HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, “should be well placed” to survive the pandemic, with its smaller workforce of around 600 employees. However, he notes that cuts – such as reduced hours, unpaid leave and redundancies – have come into effect for around one-third of his workforce.What’s more, Slow suggested that the prognosis was bright for the long-term future of the VFX industry, especially if social distancing restrictions mean that filming on-location becomes less practical.Companies are increasingly turning to Virtual Production (VP), which involves generating realistic-looking environments with digital engines.“Long term I am pretty positive on the outlook for VFX,” Slow said. “If travelling is harder, and if it’s harder to do crowd scenes, and if producers can only get insurance for working inside studios, there are opportunities for VFX companies”.Game of Thrones\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Concern has been raised over the reopening of pubs in London after scenes from Soho appeared to show people failing to observe social distancing rules.Numerous pictures and videos have been shared online of packed, crowded streets in the famous London district.One Twitter user wrote: “Just seen the scenes in Soho. It’s as if the health care workers who risked their lives trying to deal with the pandemic were just wasting their time.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnother wrote: “Cycling through London tonight made me cry. Heaving with bodies \u0026amp puke, the continual sound of police sirens. The queues in Soho like when England win a match. And yet we didn’t win. We lost! People will always be trash. But none more so than the Tories. This is on them.”One man who passed through Soho told the Daily Mirror: “Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish.”Police were present in the area, though it seems no attempts were made to disperse the crowds, which filled a number of streets closed off to cars.Large groups were also seen congregating in Notting Hill on Saturday night.The latest figures show the R rate range has risen above 1 in London – meaning cases of the virus could be growing again.In the capital, the range is thought to be between 0.8 and 1.1. Across the UK, the government says the estimated R number is between 0.7-0.9.On Friday, England’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, warned that “this virus is a long way from gone.Although ‘Super Saturday’ appears to have passed without any major incidents, there have been reports of disorder across the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Sub-Saharan Africa is behind and I think we\u0027re just at the start of their outbreak, we think in that continent.Many African countries are moving to open their airspace to encourage tourism in a bid to stave off further economic damage, even as cases climb.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A healthcare worker checks the temperature of residents during a check-up campaign in Mumbai, IndiaPeople wearing protective face masks to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus sit at a bus stop in the city of Zanjan, IranProtesters blocking an exit to the precinct of the officers who arrested Elijah McClain, cover their ears anticipating the use of flash-bang grenades by police in Aurora, ColoradoA member of the Israeli border police jumps during a Palestinian protest against Israel\u0027s plan to annex parts of the West Bank, in Kafr Qaddum near NablusA surfer jumps clear of his board while enjoying winter waves at New Brighton Beach in Christchurch, New ZealandA man is detained by riot police during a demonstration in Hong Kong.

The image of someone who had a broken beer glass pushed into his face is one I will never forget.”The measure is designed to help trade in the face of social distancing rules – with other provisions in the legislation including the streamlining of the application process to enable pubs and restaurants to get permission for on-street dining more quickly.UK will have ‘big outbreaks’ within weeks if virus rules flouted againCommenting on gatherings in London’s Soho, Lord Randall added: “The images from the weekend where in some places social distancing reduced as the alcohol intake increased gives me real concern.“Sadly drunken and anti-social behaviour is not unusual in some city centres.”Meanwhile, Labour former home secretary Lord Blunkett revealed he was “bemused” by the measure.He said: “While I am totally in favour of kick-starting elements of the economy that have been so badly damaged by the lockdown, I cannot see for the life of me that licensed premises selling alcohol off-premises ... will actually do very much, other than fuel the already worrying concerns about activity late at night, particularly in the major cities.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Rishi Sunak has been accused of watering down a Conservative manifesto pledge with a £1bn programme to plug energy-leaking buildings — after the party promised £9.2bn would be spent.The cash — part of a wider £3bn green package in the chancellor’s “mini-budget”, being unveiled this week — is also a fraction of the tens of billions being spent on a green recovery in Germany and France, campaigners warned.Greenpeace protested it was “much less than was committed to”, while the Green Alliance argued it “does not live up to the government’s own ambitions”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Sunak will pledge to create thousands of green jobs in the fightback against coronavirus, with the £1bn scheme to improve energy efficiency in schools, hospitals and other public buildings.A £50m pot will trial the retrofitting of rented social housing, installing heat pumps, insulation and double glazing in the least energy efficient properties in England.But environmental groups were quick to draw an unfavourable comparison with plans to tackle the climate emergency while reviving the economy in Germany (£36bn) and France (£13.5bn).And they pointed to last December’s Tory manifesto, which reads: “We will help lower energy bills by investing £9.2bn in the energy efficiency of homes, schools and hospitals”.“Surely this is just a down payment?” said Rosie Rogers, Greenpeace UK’s head of green recovery.“Of course this money is better than nothing, but it doesn’t measure up to the economic and environmental crises. It’s not enough to create the hundreds of thousands of new green jobs that are needed.”Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jo Furtado, of the Green Alliance think tank, said: “We need to see significantly more investment for a genuinely green recovery.”“It is just over 10 per cent of the £9.2bn to 2024 that the government pledged in its manifesto for improving the energy efficiency of UK buildings.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The law, which came into effect on Tuesday evening, allows authorities to punish crimes including secession, subversion and terrorism with up to life in prison. According to the department which runs the city’s public libraries, certain books are not available because they are under review in the wake of the new legislation. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Leisure and Cultural Services Department said in a statement that the libraries ”will review whether certain books violate the stipulations of the National Security Law.”“While legal advice will be sought in the process of the review, the books will not be available for borrowing and reference in libraries,” the statement added.

Over the weekend, Mr Wong tweeted: “Less than a week after #NationalSecurityLaw has been put in place, #HongKong’s public libraries started to put books under review and suspend them from lending, including two of mine published in 2013 and 2015.” The Chinese legislation has been criticised by foreign governments, lawyers and pro-democracy figures, who believe it will erode freedom in the former British colony.The top American diplomat in Hong Kong described the security law on Monday as a “tragedy”, which would remove ”fundamental freedoms” and generate ”atmosphere of coercion and self-censorship.” Hanscom Smith, US consul general to Hong Kong and Macau, said: ”Using the national security law to erode fundamental freedoms and to create an atmosphere of coercion and self-censorship is a tragedy for Hong Kong.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Speaking about the removal of books from public libraries, executive councillor Ronny Tong told Radio Television Hong Kong​ on Monday that the government is using “self-restraint” to ensure they comply with the new law.  The first person to be arrested under the new law was Tong Ying-kit, 23, who allegedly drove a motorbike into policemen while carrying a flag with the message ”Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time”. On Friday, the local government said this slogan was illegal.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And late last year, heeding warnings, the Iraqi researcher and scholar took his wife and daughter from his home in Baghdad to Beirut for a few months, returning just before coronavirus lockdown measures were imposed in February. On Monday evening, he was shot dead. Unknown assailants travelling on motorcycles walked up to his parked car near his home in Baghdad’s Zayouna district and shot him multiple times in the head and torso, according to surveillance video shown on Iraqi television stations. A photo showed the 47-year-old’s lifeless, blood-splattered body lying on a hospital gurnee. On Tuesday, friends and family carried his body to his home, in a wooden casket draped with the Iraqi flag, then drove him through Baghdad traffic to the cemetery in the city of Najaf for burial. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIraq Prime Minister Mustafa Kadhimi, who was a personal friend of Hashimi, vowed to find the killers. The interior ministry announced the formation of a special investigative group to pursue the assassins.“We pledge to pursue the killers to bring them to justice, and we will not allow the assassinations to return to Iraq to undermine security and stability,”  Mr Kadhimi was quoted as saying in a statement after the incident.The United States Embassy in Iraq issued a statement calling on the Iraqi government “to bring those responsible for his murder to swift justice.” Iraq’s new PM faces a host of challenges. Covid-19 is just one of themSuspicion for the assassination fell on Iranian-backed Shia militias, especially the group Katayeb Hezbollah, whose members and leaders have sparred with Hashimi on social media.Hashimi was a prominent expert on both armed Shia militias and Sunni insurgents groups. He was a frequent guest on Arabic-language television stations, especially the Saudi-backed al-Hadath network. According to the Dubai-based channel, he was working on a report on Shia militias surmising that some 70,000 of the fighters, many of whom are part of the Iraqi security forces, are loyal to Iran. Hashimi leaves behind three young children and wife. He was generous with his time, frequently meeting for hours with local and foreign journalists and scholars to discuss the nature of Iraqi armed groups. He explained in a chat during one of numerous interviews he has given Western journalists visiting Baghdad that although he was born a Shia and now identified with secular Iraqis, he had flirted once with Sunni extremism and understood the psychology that drove them.

And for that, he paid with his life.”Hashimi identified strongly with Iraq’s youthful, non-sectarian protest movement which erupted last year demanding political and social changes, including a curtailing of corruption and the dismantling of militias that have become akin to mafias lording over the government.Turkey launches ‘largest ever’ air raids against PKK fighters in IraqIraq will be hit harder by the oil price drop than by Covid-19 or IsisIraq’s new PM takes helm as country battles multiple crisesIraq suspends Reuters for three months over coronavirus report“Most of the youth are asking the politicians for a piece of bread,” Hashimi wrote in his last Tweet before he was killed. Mr Kadhimi, who came to power in May, has vowed to crack down on some of the groups, recently arresting more than a dozen members of Katayeb Hezbollah for alleged attacks on Baghdad’s Green Zone, which includes the US embassy, before releasing them after the militia abducted members of the army’s elite counter-terrorism force. Hashimi was critical of the move, speaking about the events in television interviews. One friend said he had warned him that he was going too far in his criticism only Iraqis based abroad spoke with so little restraint. “The hosts on the shows kept encouraging him to say more and more harsh things,” said the friend. In one recent television interview, a militia leader accused Hashimi of providing the prime minister with disinformation about armed groups. “Husham al-Hashimi,” said the leader. “I can say his name. He is linked to Kadhimi and his job is to disseminate false information.”Hashimi served occasionally as an official adviser to the government, especially when it was fighting a years-long war to dislodge Isis from northern Iraq. Iran’s embassy in Baghdad condemned the killing, as did the leader of the Popular Mobilisation Units, which includes militias without strong connections to Iran. The official Islamic Republic News Agency cited a fake claim for the attack by Isis, which also despised Hashimi and had threatened him over the years.

We are ready for the hypothesis of no deal.#He added: “We are open to being creative so that we keep ious sides happy.”A Finnish MEP has claimed Brexit could be the #beginning of the end# for the European Union.Laura Huhtasaari claimed Brussels is aware the EU would be more prosperous outside of the union.She also suggested the EU is trying to make it #more dficult# to leave like the UK.The politician told the Express: #Weber, who leads the European People’s Party, said thatthe UK’s exit was to be successful and you would prosper and triumph…the EU is afraid of competition.#It knows that the member states would do better without the federal state, they would do better as independent states in a free trade area.#If Brexit is a success, it will be the beginning of the end of the EU.#The EU is willing to accept UK requests that fishing opportunities be ided using a scientic method after Brexit, Thereports. The method will reflect the number of fish in UK waters rather than use the EUs Common Fisheries Policy. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has hinted that Brussels could agree to the use of zonal attachment, an important British request in ongoing trade negotiations.He said: “There will be no trade agreement with the UKthere is no balanced agreement on fisheries.”British fishing organisations believe that the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy means that they have not received their fair share of quotas – rights to catch a certain amount of fish – in UK waters.This has, they believe, contributed to the decline of the fishing industry and fishing communities over the last  years.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab rejected Chinas accusation that Britain had indulged in #gross interference# over Beijings imposition of new security legislation in Hong Kong.He told Reuters: #This isnt a gross interference in domestic affairs.#Its a matter of trust and lots of countries around the world are asking this question: does China live up to its international obligations # Earlier on Monday, Chinas ambassador to London said the remarks made by Britain could damage future Chinese investment.Ambassador Liu Xiaoming has warned the UK not to interfere with Hong Kong following the imposition by Beijing of a sweeping new national security law.It comes after the UK offered a path to citizenship for up to three million people from Hong Kong.The Chinese ambassador said this was #gross interference# from the UK.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab rejected the accusation.Fishermen in the EU have asked to get access to British fishing waters, despite the UK saying they are off-limits in current trade talks.Emiel Brouckaert, head of the Belgian fisheries association, said that they have #always been in British waters.#Mr Brouckaert stressed catches from British waters “bring  percent of our income”, the Express reports.He added: #We hope that the European Parliament will remember us during the negotiations.#The Russian Embassy in London has said Moscow deserves the right to respond to the sanctions announced against Russians, the RIA News Agency reported.#It is particularly outrageous that the senior representatives of the General Prosecution and the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation as well as judges were included in the sanctions list,# the agency cited an embassy spokesman as saying.For Russia, the biggest name on the list was Alexander Bastrykin, the state investigator whose Investigative Committee reports direct to Putin.Britainimposed sanctions on  Russians and  Saudis today as part of post-Brexit measures.Foreign minister Dominic Raab said the measures were aimed at stopping the laundering of #blood money#.Raab has pressed for tough sanctions and set out the first names in parliament, including Russian nationals Britain says were involved in the mistreatment and death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and Saudis held to be involved in the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.#If youre a kleptocrat or an organised criminal, you will not be able to launder your blood money in this country,# Raab told parliament.The Government have launched a consultation on plans for UK courts to have the final say on legal disputes after Brexit.Officials are asking the judiciary, lawyers and business to comment on the reforms which will decide which British courts have the power to depart from EU case law.At present, only the UK Supreme Court and the High Court of Justiciary in Scotland will have this power from December .Under proposals set out by the justice secretary Robert Buckland, the government argues the reforms will allow courts and judges in the country to reconsider cases on matters like borders, taxes and fisheries and make the final decision.It is hoped this will allow cases to progress more quickly.Hong Kongs pro-Beijing chief executive Carrie Lam should be targeted by the UKs post-EU sanctions regime, MPs have said.Former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and former Labour minister Chris Bryant called for Ms Lam to be placed on the sanctions list following the suppression of pro-democracy protests in the special autonomous region.Sir Iain said: #I dont expectto answer specically, but I do ask him this simple question # does he not agree that given the announcement of this in the papers today, many in Hong Kong have said this should go to whatever highest level the evidence takes it #Would he be prepared, therefore, given that, to follow through with these no matter who these iniduals are, no matter how high they go, eventhat meant starting with Carrie Lam whose family, I understand, have the privilege of British passports #Mr Raab replied: #We will of course want to make sure we proceed in a rigorous way, we want it to be based on evidence.#But the advantage that we have, one of the reasons that I have always been a fan, a champion, a supporter of these measures, is that they allow us to continue to engage bilaterally with countries that frankly we need to whilst having targeted sanctions, the visa bans and the asset freezes, on the iniduals who may be responsible.#Where the evidence shows that is the case weve got the mechanism to deliver it.#Ireland has said it expects Britain and the EU to seal a trade deal in late October as Brexit talks take place in London.Foreign minister Simon Coveney warned the negotiations are #in a dficult place# but predicted both sides will pull off a last minute agreement.Mr Coveney said: #Very, very little progress has been made.

Speaking in the Commons this afternoon, the Foreign Secretary said: #From today, the UK will have new powers to stop those involved in serious human rights abuses and violations from entering the UK, channelling money through our banks and profiting from our economy.#This is a clear example of how the UK will help to lead the world in standing up for human rights.#We will not let those who seek to inflict pain and destroy the lives of innocent victims benefit from what the UK has to offer.#The UKs post-Brexit, #autonomous sanctions# regime is set to be brought into force on Monday.The Foreign Office says it will target #the worlds worst human rights violators and abusers, and those complicit in their crimes#.The department said it will be the first time that the UK has sanctioned people or entities for human rights violations and abuses under a UK-only regime, and will allow the UK #to work independently with allies such as the US, Canada, Australia and the European Union#.An FCO spokesperson said: #The regime will allow the UK to target iniduals and organisations around the world unlike conventional geographic sanctions regime, which only target a country.#Future targets of the regime may include those who commit unlawful killings perpetrated against journalists and media workers, or activity motivated on the grounds of religion or belief.#Britain wants to seethere is a chance for progress in talks with the EU this week after last weeks round of Brexit negotiations ended a day early with signicant dferences between the two sides.# Frost#has set out #that while the talks continue to be constructive there are still signicant dferences between us. #It is a chance to have some further discussions to see what progress might be made,# the spokesman said.The European Union will take decisive action against the United Statesit is unwilling to settle a long-running row over aircraft subsidies, Europes trade commissioner said on Monday. A trade dispute dating back to  over subsidies for Europes Airbus and U.S. planemaker Boeing is drawing to a conclusion at the World Trade Organization .It has already awarded Washington the right to impose duties on . billion of European goods related to subsidies given to Airbus but is only expected to rule in September what retaliation Europe can take over support for Boeing.European Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan told the European Parliaments trade committee that Washington had twice rejected EU proposals to settle the dispute and he hoped the WTO would issue its findings as soon as possible in September.EU officials said they did not expect the United States to want to settle the dispute before then.He said: #I want to reassure people that we are ready to act decisively and strongly on the European Union sidewe dont get the type of outcome that we expect from the United States in relationship to finalising this -year-old dispute.#Industry leaders have welcomed the prospect of a high-level summit to discuss how small businesses will trade with the United States after Brexit, The Times reports.Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, confirmed this week that Whitehall and Washington had agreed to hold an upcoming roundtable to discuss small business in the American city of Boston in October. Mike Cherry, national chairman of Federation of Small Businesses, said: “As we enter a new era for global trade, it’s critical that small firms are placed front and centre of negotiators’ minds.“The inclusion of a specic small business chapter into every trade deal we sign — whether that be with the US, Japan, the EU and beyond — is crucial to the success and livelihoods of thousands of businesses as well as millions of jobs.”Dominic Raab is set to lay out a post-Brexit sanctions regime for Britain today, which will freeze assets from countries abusing human rights.The Foreign Secretary tweeted: #Today I will introduce a sanctions regime that will target people who have committed the gravest human rights violations. #Global Britain will be an even stronger force for good in the world, in the years ahead.#— Dominic RaabJuly , Consumers in the euro zone ed en masse to shops in May as lockdowns were eased in the bloc, estimates from the EU statistics agency show.Sales in the  countries sharing the euro zone rose by .% in May from April, Eurostat said, in the steepest increase since euro zone records for retail sales began in .The rise was higher than market expectations of a % rise on the month.Compared to a year earlier, sales were still down .% in May, showing the recovery is far from completeSales of clothes and footwear, the sector most hit by reduced trade during the pandemic, posted a .% increase in May from April, although were still down .% year-on-year.President Emmanuel Macron has promised his new French government # expected to be named later today # will be one of purpose and unity.The French leader fired off a series of tweets late Sunday as he gears up with a new government team for the last two years of his five-year term.Macron last week ditched the prime minister, Edouard Philippe, who steered France through its coronavirus lockdown and the first three years of Macrons presidency.The new prime minister, Jean Castex, is a career civil servant with no ministerial experience.

But, this time, don’t head straight back indoors after the clap. Linger in the street, talk to your neighbours, perhaps pop by to say hello to someone who has been on their own during lockdown.We want people to thank each other.On my road there have been a lot of people putting notes through the letterbox saying, “If  you are self-isolating and need help, please call this number”.I now know who my postman is, partly because I am working from home, and I check in with him and have a chat to see how he is. I will be at No Downing Street with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to applaud the NHS and carers on Sunday.Afterwards there will be a barbecue with the NHS staff who looked after the Prime Minister when he was in hospital with Covid-.Hopefully, there will be a moment to address issues of how to look after our NHS workers properly. Many of the NHS staff tell us they were just doing their jobs and that was their purpose in le.For the nurses and doctors, looking after people is a calling.This is our chance to show how grateful we are that they followed that calling and stay true to it — even when their lives are in danger.Of course, this is not a celebration, because people are still passing away and carers are still being put in danger.Tonight we would like people to put some kind of light in their window, an electric one rather than a candle, and to pause for reflection.Many landmarks will also be lit up in blue as we remember the thousands who have lost their lives.The other reason why this weekend is a good time to come together again is that there have been signs of a ide in the nation. We also need to remember that we are not over coronavirus  yet.We don’t know what is going to happen and there is a risk that there will be a second spike.We have already seen in Leicester that a fresh lockdown was needed and people are still dying.News is changing so fast and there is so much uncertainty.The Together coalition, which I am part of, hopes we can bring back that special spirit that helped us get through the worst of the crisis.We hope that Sunday can be a positive spark.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The big aim was to save lives and protect the vulnerable.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesI doubt it occurred to many parents that schools would be closed for nearly FOUR months, and counting, or that they were about to take a pivotal role in educating their own children.But that is what has happened. And I know from friends with school-aged children that it has been, shall we say, a bit challenging.So I want to dedicate this column to the hundreds of thousands of parents who became home-educators overnight — with a particular shout out to the “lucky” ones who had to do this while also doing their regular jobs.Trying to educate your child, with no idea of when schools will reopen, and at the same time as trying to do justice to your day job, is seriously hard and my hat comes off to all of you.Now that the UK is slowly unlocking, there are many working parents who face the prospect of having to go back to their jobs.Some have children back at school until the end of term. But it is fair to say that no one is in an ideal situation.It has been a slog for everyone — and what we all need is a holiday. But with all the chaos and uncertainty surrounding trips abroad, and most UK holiday homes and campsites now already booked up, many of us will have been lucky to plan any kind of trip.More pressingly, many of the children’s holiday clubs people rely on are closed. After all, try telling a bunch of seven-year-olds to stay socially distant during a game of football.Many families rely on grand- parents to fill the childcare gaps during school holidays.But even though restrictions have eased, lots of grandparents will have underlying health conditions that make it unsafe for them to venture out.They will be stuck at home, missing family and unable to help out with childcare.In short, there is an army of working parents out there, already on their knees after four months of combining school and work, who now face their kids having seven more weeks off school, with no structure and support.What are working parents to do  This is a really tough situation for families.There are some basic things that parents can do to make le easier — and right at the top of that list is to lower your standards.Very few things are so important that they cannot wait until tomorrow. No one died because the house was not Hoovered.One thing I do know is that when you are working all the hours God sends and looking after kids, “me time” is almost impossible. But when you are firing on all cylinders, it is all too easy to burn out.So my advice for this particular Sunday is this — try to find even just one hour to go for a walk or meet a friend.Or find a corner where no one can bother you, and read a book, do some yoga, have a bath and pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine.The rest of the world can go hang while you recharge your batteries and live to fight another day.Parenting is the hardest job in the world at the best of times. It does not come with a manual or instructions. It is relentless and you get very little thanks.The rewards are happy, healthy, balanced adults — but that comes -plus years later.If you are struggling, remember this — it will pass. Meanwhile, take it a day at a time and hang in there. You are doing a sterling job.The BBC has found the perfect solution to lockdown filming, with their revival of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads series of monologues.No need to worry about social-distancing with a cast of one.And Killing Eve star Jodie Comer playing a part first performed by Julie Walters in the s in Her Big Chance, was brilliant.She is a fantastic actor, as we well know from Killing Eve, and this performance demonstrated her versatility, too.Did you see those pictures of Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha, who is , stripping down to her underwear If you did, then you may well have uttered the word: “Why ”But she wanted to show what women really look like, and to demonstrate the power that a filter, camera angle and ious other cunning techniques can have in efforts to make women look more “perfect”.When you think about the multiple images of “perfection” that women are subjected to daily, you realise that unless there is a visible antidote to this – actual evidence that real women are not perfect after all – we will never change the pressure we are under.So, good on you, Nadia.This was a successful attempt to highlight the degree to which the camera does, indeed, lie – but also the pressure we are all under to distort normality.I know many people who look great in photos but normal in real le.That feeling of need to alter your image can be a sort of self-hatred. It also fuels others’ need to airbrush themselves, so that all of us risk becoming unrecognisable in real le.The problem with altering your image is that you are fooling precisely no one.What is far better is to love yourself, no matter what you look like.Seeking adulation from people you don’t know and will never meet is a fool’s game because it will never, ever pay idends.It’s so easy to indulge in regret – but this is also a fool’s game.Anyone tempted by its lure needs to take a leaf out of Pierce Brosnan’s book.He said this week he has “no regret” after being told over the phone that he was being replaced in his role as James Bond.The actor, now , had his last outing as  in Die Another Day in  – and although he was eager to do a fth film, producers decided they wanted to reboot the role.Instead of feeling bitter and resentful, he said: “There’s no regret. I do not let regret come into my world . . . it just leads to more misery and more regrets.”Pierce is one of those actors who really has mastered the art of growing old gracefully – a le goal for all of us.He is a gorgeous man and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.Oh, and judging from recent photos, he could still play Bond now.I know many people have been disappointed they are having to scale back plans for big summer weddings.If you’ve been arranging the biggest and best day of your le, you might be wondering whether it’s better to just postpone altogether.For what it’s worth, I have some advice. It really is just a day. Yes, it should be lovely but it’s not the wedding that is important – it’s what happens afterwards.By that, I mean the rest of your married le together.It’s easy to get caught up with expectation and convention but maybe this is a chance to think about what you really want and what matters to you as a couple.You may also realise thatyou marry at the moment there can be no first dance – a tradition surely conceived during the s when couples don’t have sex before marriage – and a cause for celebration.The local lockdown in Leicester is a stark reminder that the next few months, and maybe years, could bring plenty more of the same. Anywhere.When this does happen, we will all have to do our bit.But hearing garment manufacturers in Leicester saying it will defy the city’s lockdown shines a light on what, for some, is the nub of the matter – for so many people, lockdown equals a loss of income.They cannot afford to lose any more money, evenit means putting lives at risk.That is going to be a real problem. But staying open “evenit puts lives at risk” is a cavalier and dangerous attitude.If you own a factory, it is your job to make sure your workers are safe.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There should be more opportunity to continue learning, developing the knowledge and skills required to land a job or, better still, become a future entrepreneur.We should seize the opportunity to create new jobs in the regions by regenerating the North and the Midlands, including tackling climate change, housing and construction, and the added social care challenges of supporting an ageing population.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Chancellor should also work with business and the trade unions to recruit , employers willing to assist, by offering them incentives and subsidies, including help with National Insurance and pension contributions.Additionally, existing underspends and the Apprenticeship Levy, together with potential benefit payments, should be topped up to create a £billion fund to meet the challenge of a record ­million under-s predicted to be out of work by Christmas. This is not just a matter of hard-headed public policy.It is about the lives of every inidual and their chances of building a future for themselves, developing a family of their own and contributing to their community. It is about what ­happens when aimlessness turns either into apathy or, more likely, into what my grandfather would have described as the danger of “idle hands”.History has taught us that society begins to unravel when young men without prospects, stability or the capacity to provide a role model become an unattractive prospect as a lelong partner.The future is grim when young women feel that they alone carry the responsibility of nurturing a child, and when a lack of prospects and progress to something better leads to a “live today and to hell with tomorrow” attitude.Former Conservative minister Lord Willetts has written and spoken convincingly about the danger of the generational ide.His honest reflections of how the austerity measures put in place in  hit younger people hardest, and how the protected ­pensions of the past, combined with the enormous rise in property values, have placed the majority of older people in a more favourable place to face the future showed great insight.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Young people lack the prospects of a secure job and either owning their own home or affording the rent.That is why we should face this challenge head-on and invest now, or we will pick up the cost later.In , during the early days of the New Labour government, our New Deal for the young unemployed offered four options.Not surprisingly, the bulk of young people went for either jobs with ­training attached or full-time education, which would lead to much better prospects of holding on to a job with decent earnings.Another lesson learnt, including in -, was that much of what needed to be done should be localised.The tendency to over-centralise ­everything has bedevilled us in this crisis.From the failure to devolve test-and-trace to local government through to months of ineptitude in ­getting our children back to school, the Government has classically created a central bureaucracy then blamed it for failure.While it has done the right thing in investing money in recovery ­programmes for our children over the winter, astonishingly, it failed to put any money in for recovery for those  to -year-olds in further education in sixth-form colleges.These are the young people whose vocational training and practical ­opportunities for work will be vital both for the economic recovery and for their own chances of getting a job.After all, you cannot promise a ­guarantee of apprenticeships or work experiencea business has folded.The Government needs to work with and listen to young people, employers and those in education and training.Unfashionable as it is at this moment to talk about universities, it is crucial that those capable of taking up such opportunities should be supported in doing so.If we don’t, they will be the ones who take the jobs of those less qualied and less confident.The result is simple. The least educated and the most vulnerable will be the ones to lose out most.Thinking these things through ­carefully, being able to act decisively and learning from the past, while not living in it, is surely common sense.And by God, we need a great deal more of that right now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m angry, upset.“I just want people to know the way they [Wizz Air] operate, their lack of compassion. Their communication is zero.I feel sorry for the people working there because they have obviously not been trained very well. It was utter chaos.He added: Myself and James are on an emotional rollercoaster at the moment.James, ,  said: “I managed to make it on. No thanks to Wizz Air who were trying to kick me off the plane.“I kind of tricked them into thinking my passport was Portuguese, which is why I didn’t get thrown off the plane. “I can’t imagine what my uncle feels like at this moment not getting to see his brother. I’d be absolutely livid. “I saw my dad at the hospital. He was unconscious but he was still alive. The soonest my uncle could get after that was a flight with BA the following morning.“Shortly after he arrived at the airport my dad passed away a couple of minutes later. So he didn’t get to see him.He added: “The damage is done there’s no coming back from what they [Wizz Air] have done there.”To add to the family’s torment, a two-hour delay in kicking furious passengers off the Wizz Air flight meant James had to sleep in their hire car after landing in Portugal as the hotel was closed for the night.Staff on board the low cost carriers flight said they had been told there had been a change in the rules which meant those without a Portuguese passport or visa would not be allowed in. Passengers said they contacted Lisbon Airport and staff there said there is no such rule in place.Official sources told The Sun Wizz Air made a mistake in human error by kicking the passengers off.Police were even called to escort passengers who refused to leave the flight back to the airport terminal on Saturday evening. Clive said: “We got to the gate and my nephew was let through. I was told to stand aside.“There were already a few people there. We were told to wait, there was no explanation then it became clear we weren’t going to fly.“People were getting really agitated. It was an awful situation. It all kicked off.“The only reason they let my nephew through is because he’s got an Italian passport.“We were corralled into this corner by check in. The Wizz Air staff were absolutely appalling.James said: I was able to get on the plane then they tried to kick us off because they were sayingyou didn’t have Portuguese passport and Portuguese residency, you need to get off.“They went through a couple of hours later and checked everybody’s passport. I didn’t show them the cover of my passport. I just flashed the photo page.“It was really lucky I got through. This is a complete cock-up by Wizz. There were no restrictions. I went straight through immigration in Portugal with absolutely no problems.“What they were saying was we’ll be turned away and they can’t allow us on the plane. Absolute rubbish.Other passengers raged at the airlines mistake.Data engineer Joseph Honeywood, , was jetting out from Luton to Lisbon to work for a month when he was ordered off. Joseph, from Erith, South East London, spent £ on his flights.He said: “There were about  of us who had to get off. Its so frustrating. I was really looking forward to going out there for a few weeks to enjoy the sunshine and get away.At one point Wizz Air staff said people could go on the flight but when we got there we could not enter the country. It was a joke.Another passenger said: Wizz Air staff used fear tactics to get people off. We couldnt believe it. Then they even called the police for people who would not leave.Rules at the time said people are free to travel to the country but must self-isolate for  days upon . A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said: We attended in a supporting capacity and no offences occurred. A spokesman for Wizz Air said at the time: Wizz Air sincerely apologises to customers on board the Luton to Lisbon service yesterday evening, who were wrongfully informed that British nationals are not eligible to enter Portugal. This was a result of a genuine mistake by the airline.

With other sports there may be issues.“It’s not a question of how do we make it better, it just has to stop across the board.These healthy conversations will help make a change because people will learn more about this and will educate their kids.“I want to use my position as a sportsman with a big  to put back into the community and unite and change the image.I don’t want us to only be relevant when I’m knocking someone out or a police off­icer has his knee on someone’s neck.“I want us to have positive images that there are architects, doctors, entrepreneurs, lawyers and valuable members of British society amongst the afro carribean community.”Patrick: “It is probably about the same. The only dference is, now it is unacceptable whereas before it was acceptable.I’ve heard fans giving racial abuse to players on the pitch and clubs get a few thousand pounds fine. Where are the £million fines  That would send a real message.”Trevor: “As a teenager and student I stopped going to see my club, Cha, in the early Seventies. They used to throw darts, and I realised I had become the bullseye in the Shed end. That’s not going to happen now.“But we need to think about how could it be that in football, where around  per cent of players are people of colour, of the  managers in the top flight just one is black.“So the answer is not that there is more racism in the game — I think things are much better than they were, but the game itself now has to say, ‘Are the black guys in the game for everybody’s entertainment or do they become leaders too ’ ”Hugh: “Just three of  board ­members – board positions on national sport ­governing bodies – were held by ­people who were non-white. Do you see any barriers  Andthere are any, what can alleviate them ”Anthony: “I think it is important to take your destiny in your own hands and that will lead me to my career after boxing where I’m in control.“I want to be financially literate, understand accounts, legals, business conduct. All these aspects will help put me in a managerial position.“I’ve had these conversations with my management team, with my partners and sponsors. Even as a black man myself I know how many people I hire from one community to an­other. I have been making changes.”Trevor: “I love what Anthony just said. Nobody is going to be able to put on a big boxing event without Anthony Joshua. So he says, ‘By the way, when you put this event on I want to see ersity.’And that is fantastic, because black sportspersons did not do that in the past. Possibly the only one that would have done that would have been Muhammad Ali.“So a generation of sportspeople like Anthony are now using their powers to change things more widely.”Katharine: “It is not just a problem in sport because in the top  FTSE companies there is no black CEO. Over half of them don’t have a black board member. We do need to win hearts and minds.”Stuart: “Look at the top — the FA board members, the ersity, the age range, the amount of men there. Unless we are changing the way the top looks, we are always going to have these conversations.”Hugh: “We have seen TV presenters wear Black Lives Matter badges, we saw the words on the back of the shirts in the Premier League. And we have seen broadcasters taking badges off. Do you think Black Lives Matter just as a statement has ­suddenly become too isive ”Katharine: “People want to show themselves to not be racist, so they wear something and say, ‘look at me, I am not a racist’.I want to say to them, ‘Why don’t you volunteer in a charity  Come and work in the inner city with young black people ’  I don’t want the stuff that signals — I want the stuff that does something.”ROHAN Aden, , of Harrow: “What does Black Lives Matter mean to you ”Anthony: “I believe that the mass ­gatherings are so important because it spreads awareness. I stand for what the Black Lives Matter slogan means.“There are architects, doctors, ­entrepreneurs, lawyers and valuable members of British society among the Afro-Caribbean community. I believe it will move to a better place.“I’m still really connected to my grass roots. So I went back to the community in Watford and am working on a project.“I want to help the local kids from every background with opportunities.”Stuart: “This fight is my fight – it is not my son’s fight. I want to make sure in the rest of the time I have here I am dedicating myself to this, to seeing real change.“I know it is not going to happen overnight. I want to make sure when my son is my age this conversation isn’t a thing.”Trevor: “We should not get into the mindframe of thinking thateverything we always wanted to happen doesn’t happen in the next three months, then it has all been pointless.The big step ­forward recently is that people are no longer embarrassed to talk about race.”Katharine: “I think these last few weeks have given us the opportunity to do exactly what we are doing here, which is talk about the issue.“I think it is important not to alienate people because we all want to live in a society together where we can get on.” KIRSTY Wright, , of Kent: “Do you have faith in the British policing ­sys­tem or do you think prejudice still exists ”Stuart: “It took one good copper to do something that made a massive impact into my brother’s case and I am always mindful of that.They have moved forward but there is always going to be that institutional racism in the Met while people do the same sort of things and the same sort of training and the same people who are in there.”Patrick: “The reasons my friends and I went down to the Black Lives Matter protests was because of our lack of trust in the national policing system.“We thought we needed to oversee young children to stop them getting into any trouble. Black people get a raw deal when it comes to policing.”Trevor: “There is still a major issue for some police forces but anybody who says there has not been any change isn’t looking at what is happening and would be massively disrespecting both the work that Stuart and the Lawrence family did and its impact, which has been profound in this country.”Anthony: “This is a topic I don’t know the solution to because when you are put in a position of power it just depends how you use it. I think young people start out thinkingthey are in trouble they call the police.But then they see the video of a police officer with his knee on George Floyd’s neck and it can become a massive distrust.”JULIE Howe, of Kent: “How can we change the National Curriculum to give our children a better education on black history and race issues ”Katharine: “Education is complex and the reason children don’t know lots of things is more to do with the poor behaviour in schools and poor teaching methods.I have never seen a history textbook that doesn’t teach slavery, civil rights in America, colonialism.”Stuart: “I was a school teacher for  years. And to be honest, what you focus on a lot is how to get kids through their GCSEs. I would like to see kids have more choice to pick the history topics.”Patrick: “When I was at school I learned about the Tudors, Henry VIII Samuel Pepys and Oliver Cromwell.“I never learned about anybody that looked like me. And with the World Wars, there were black people involved, but it was not documented in school.”Trevor: “Schools are trying to tackle these things. What I think may be more important is the fact that figures of authority in our schools, by and large, are not black.If I had a criticism of where we are in the schools system, it is less the curriculum but more what you see and feel every day as you go into school.”Anthony: “We have a problem within the Afro-Caribbean community with the curriculum. We have state schools that produce a certain agenda and private schools that have control and produce a certain agenda.I would like to see what can be done to connect the two.”“WOULD removing statues be to lie about our history, as the Prime Minister has suggested ”Patrick: “Anybody that had benefitted from slavery in this huge way, andthey have been celebrated for it, then yes, those statues should come down.”Stuart: “I flip-flop on this one. A  to discuss which statues should come down is a side distraction.The main point is equality for everyone, for every black person. If we have more representatives at the top table, other issues will be sorted along the way.”Katharine: “I am a headmistress so I would always be telling our children not to go round tearing down statues.“It is very dficult to decide who goes and who stays, which is I why I have come to the conclusion that ­plaques by the statues are the best way forward so we can all learn something.”Trevor: “I would never want the whole statue thing to become an excuse for people saying, ‘Look we took down the statue – we have done something.’“What leans me slightly against pulling them down is I don’t want people to forget.If we pretend transatlantic ­slavery was just about some particularly nasty iniduals, andwe get rid of them, that is fine – but we are making out there were some bad people who did bad things, rather than the monstrous crime transatlantic slavery was.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jessica is terried she will never work again.“Meghan has forsaken her most loyal friend just to look woke.”Former actress Meghan, , met Jessica in Toronto while filming US legal drama Suits.But she distanced herself from her after she was exposed by Canadian influencer and blogger Sasha Exeter for using her “wealth and privilege” to attempt to shut her up in the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement.The scandal started last month when Sasha posted a “call to action” to people with large online followings to support the Black Lives Matter movement.Sasha revealed that Jessica seemed to think this was aimed at her — even though it mentioned nobody by name — and sent her a string of offensive messages.She also claimed Jessica spoke to sponsors and companies that worked with her, which she said was “an attempt to silence a black woman during this movement behind closed doors”.She called her response “textbook white privilege”.Sasha also shared screenshots that showed Jessica threatening to sue her and which saw her sacked from her roles on bridal show I Do, Redo and Good Morning America.But a source close to Jessica said: “She was stupid and tone deaf but she’s definitely not racist.”After the scandal, Jessica — married to former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney’s son Ben,  — tried to apologise by referring to her friendship with Meghan.She wrote on Instagram: “I have lived a very public and personal experience with my closest friend where race was front and centre.”However, her work prospects now appear in tatters as many companies employed her partly because of her connection to the royal, according to our sources.The insider added: “She is losing so much work from brands who loved her connection to Meghan in the past but now feels she has become toxic.“All it would take is for Meghan to go out on a shopping trip with Jessica to show she still has her support. But the clear indication is that there’s not going to be any show of support like that.“It’s a brutal blow after a ten-year friendship. Jessica has been there for Meghan through thick and thin.”Jessica became best friends with Meghan shortly after she joined the cast of Suits in .Meghan started spending most of her time in Toronto and they quickly bonded over their shared love of yoga and fashion. Jessica was a useful pal for the aspiring actress to have, as she is a high-profile stylist, influencer and a socialite in Canada.The pair quickly became close and started taking holidays together, posting pictures of their trips on social media.When Prince Harry, , and Meghan started dating and he visited her in Toronto, Jessica and Ben would host the couple at their family home.As their relationship blossomed and became more public, Jessica also found herself in the spotlight.When Meghan was seen with Harry at the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games in , she had her mother, Doria Ragland, alongside her as well as Jessica and Markus Anderson — who is said to have introduced her to the prince.Jessica was said to be Meghan’s “unofficial wedding planner”, jetting to London to finalise arrangements for the big day in .She also attended a small hen party for the future duchess and made herself available for dress fittings. Jessica was even said to have helped Meghan choose Givenchy as the designer.Both Jessica and Ben attended the wedding and all three of her children took part in the ceremony — Ivy, then four, was a bridesmaid and her then seven-year-old twins Brian and John were page boys. In February last year she also attended Meghan’s baby shower in New York along with stars including tennis ace Serena Williams.All the attention saw Jessica’s star status soar, but some pals say that made Meghan uncomfortable.However, the timing of the fallout could be particularly awkward for the duchess because Jessica could play a pivotal role in Meghan’s upcoming court case with the Mail on Sunday.Jessica is widely believed to be the anonymous friend who briefed People magazine about the letter Meghan sent to her father Thomas Markle.Pals think Meghan may need to try and keep Jessica onside to ensure she does not go rogueasked to participate in the case. However, Meghan is famous for ghosting those who were once close to her, with everyone from her school friends to her father to Piers Morgan being brutally cut off.In fact, the term “being Meghan Markled” is now recognised online as a relationship term describing when people are chopped out your le without warning.The source added: “When Meghan makes a decision to ghost someone she doesn’t usually go back.“But, when it comes to Jessica, hopefully she has learnt her lesson from the past and realises that it’s not a great idea.“Jessica knows all her secrets and everything she’s been through. This is not someone she wants to make an enemy of at this time.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An idea that might have sounded funny, in a drunken Zoom meeting, with the “creatives”, but collapses the moment you see the first dog-cam footage.Five seconds of low-level barrelling, round Georgia Toffolo’s gaff, you feel queasy. Twenty and you’re probably spray-painting your own walls green, which is why the pets are accompanied everywhere by a camera crew. So what you’ve actually got here, on prime-time, is Dog In An Empty House.If at this point you’re expecting the guessing game to sustain your interest in Celebrity Snoop Dogs, I have more bad news. On Friday it lasted about as long as it took Kevin to describe the kitchen lighting as “ETERNAL” and the viewers to think “Right then, it’s Louise Redknapp”. Sure enough, ten minutes later: “Hi. I’m Louise Redknapp.”Not one of the great TV reveals, although it was positively bewitching compared to week one, when Kevin Bridges’ labrador Annie wandered past some football shirts, early on, and the owner was duty bound to point out at the end: “One of them says BRIDGES. So unless you’re a moron, you’d have probably guessed it was me.”Kevin’s got a point here, I think, and has also identied Channel ’s target audience. To such an extreme level I reckon even ITV might have thought, “It’s a bit beneath us.”Celebrity Snoop Dogs is beneath almost everyone, truth be told. Although the slightly galling thing for me personally is I appear to be an exception and part of that target audience as I had real problems with week one’s second celebrity, who’s got a lovely house in London and a lhasa apso with an underbite called Charlie, who looks like a Wookiee version of Keira Knightley.Yes, there were a lot of Strictly Come Dancing clues but no there wasn’t a dog house marked “Vernon”. I was already thinking about the host, though, when Kevin said “Grey drawers compliment the veins of marble” and couldn’t contain myself any longer when he added “It’s an antique clothes hanger”, so I actually shouted: “TESS DALY.”Sure enough, when the big reveal came, it was confirmed . . .  “Hi, I’m Shirley Ballas.”A fine woman who, it transpires, rescued Charlie from certain death. “He was about to be euthanised at a dog shelter” in Los Angeles. But instead he’s now starring in Celebrity Snoop Dogs.I know, I know — swings and roundabouts, Charlie.

Sources said they believed the company was the victim of a US propaganda campaign to keep it out of the G network being built in Britain.A number of people named in the report are said to have denied being targeted or influenced in any way.Among those named are former Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who previously chaired the powerful Commons liaison committee.She told \" rel\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"Theshe had no knowledge of any covert campaign.Ms Wollaston claimed the only contact with Huawei she could recall was an offer made via an intermediary to sponsor an event to mark the th anniversary of the select committee’s system.She said she rejected the offer.Ms Wollaston told the paper: “If they tried to influence me, they didn’t get very far.”Another on the list Lord Clement-Jones, a Liberal Democrat peer, said there would have been no need to target him as he sits on Huaweis international advisory board. He told : “My connection to the company is well known.

This pub in Batley, West Yorkshire announced it would be closing its doors after receiving a call from a customer on July  saying they had tested positive for COVID-.

Punters across England flocked to pubs and restaurants on Super Saturday to enjoy a drink at the pub after three months of lockdown.Thousands of thirsty Brits poured into pubs and restaurants from am and downed million pints after they opened their doors for the first time in  days on Saturday.But Brits heading back to the pub were also subject to new restrictions.

He told a Downing Street press briefing in June: This virus is a long way from gone, it is not going to be gone for a long time.

The Chancellor will announce the Government’s plans to avoid mass unemployment as the furlough scheme comes to an end, as well as broader measures to steer the economy through the fall-out of the pandemic. Businesses offering unpaid traineeships for young people in England will receive a £, bonus per trainee under a £million scheme. There were also reports that Mr Sunak will exempt the majority of home-buyers from paying stamp duty. He was considering raising the threshold at which stamp duty is payable from £, to as high as £,.But there was speculation he could put off making the change until autumn. This could slow the housing market to a halt in the next three months as buyers wait for the move to kick in. The Resolution Foundation, which has held talks with Treasury officials, published a £bn package of ideas to boost the economy. They include a £bn shopping voucher giveaway – £ for every adult and £ per child – to support the high street. Other suggestions include £bn a year of job support, including extending the Job Retention Scheme for hard-hit sectors.It also proposes capping firms’ repayments on crisis loans at % of turnover, and a £bn Universal Credit boost for low-income families.The report predicts the UK economy could shrink by .% this year, the biggest annual hit in a century – but smaller than the % hit forecast by the Bank of England. However, it warns next year’s recovery is likely to be far slower, at %, when the Bank of England forecast a % bounceback. James Smith, of the Resolution Foundation, said: “With interest rates at record lows, the Chancellor will need to take the lead in delivering an ambitious response to secure economic recovery. “The measures the Chancellor announces in his mini-Budget need to be big enough to reflect the size of the crisis we face, targeted at the sectors that need most support, and flexible enough to cope with the uncertainties that lie ahead.”Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham urged the Chancellor to address deep regional inequalities by considering a Real Living Wage."},{"url":null,"title":"what rishi sunaks covid 19","story":"NewsWhat will be in Rishi Sunaks Covid- mini budget  Rumours and what to expectThe Chancellor is set to announce a fairly substantial economic package with the aim of supporting the economy as we come out of lockdownShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror money video how--voucher-scheme-save-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Has your pub been forced to close because a customer has tested positive for coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror It reads: This isn’t the message we wanted to write so soon but The Lighthouse will be closed due to a customer testing positive to Covid-. We are slowly getting through our list of customers that were in the pub on Saturday. All our staff are going to be tested and we will reopen when the time is safe to do so. Thanks to all the positive phone calls. Prior to The Lighthouse opening it had posted on its Facebook page a list of new rules that customers must stick to including all patrons must give their name and address to staff and sanitise before entering entering the building.  It also stated that furniture should not be moved for any reason as it has been placed to comply with social distancing and there is a one way system throughout the premises. The post also says: Please understand that this is a learning curve for us all and I am sure some measures may change very quicklythe system fails to work. We are in this together to keep all of us safe, hope to see you all soon. The Lighthouse Family. The Fox  Hounds, in Batley, West Yorkshire, also reopened on Saturday and announced they were closed in a Facebook post today.  The pubs are believed to be the first in England to close and have to contact customers due to coronavirus. The post said: Following our announcement this morning that we will be closed until further notice Iaposd like to put all rumours and speculations straight that are currently floating about. This morning I got a phone call off a customer which visited our pub on Saturday to say theyaposd tested positive for coronavirus. On their visit they were unaware and had no symptoms but after seeing a post off another place theyaposd visited thought it was best to take a test to which they came back positive.  Due to privacy reasons we wonapost be naming this person. Following this information we are awaiting further guidance from NHS and track and trace. Myself and all staff have taken a test today and we should have results back within  hours. The pub manager added that the premises will be deep cleaned before they reopen.  The post ended: We fully understand this is a scary time but want to ensure our customer safety is our main priority in these tough times. Over the past few weeks we have put a lot of hard work into the pub following government guidance to get us opened back up. Anyone that has visited us this weekend can see our new layout of tables of one metre plus, our one way systems, full table service and continuously cleaning throughout. A third pub in Alverstoke, Hampshire, also announced on its Facebook that a customer had tested positive for Covid- so it was closed.  The Village Home posted: We have had a case of Coronavirus in the pub which means that some of us are in isolation.The pub is now shut but all being well will open again on Saturday.Anyone who was in the pub over the weekend there is no need to isolate unless you show symptoms or are contacted direct by the trace group. Thank you and hope to see you soon.  In addition to pubs, hairdressers, restaurants, cafes and campsites also reopened after the government eased lockdown restrictions to get the nation moving again.However worrying scenes of hundreds of drinkers ignoring social distancing rules and carnage in the streets over the weekend have sparked fresh fears of a second wave of coronavirus and local lockdowns. Police had to break up fights and deal with other trouble while some revellers overindulged on aposSuper Saturdayapos which one top cop said was as busy as New Yearaposs Eve.

Sandy the Border Collie is sadly due to be put down next week but at around pm he ran off and became stuck.Sandy has a brain tumour and vets say his le needs to be ended to avoid suffering, reports Grimsby Live.Martyn, from Mexborough, South Yorkshire, went to rescue his pet and he too became stranded in thick mud. Luckily a police officer patrolling the area was on hand and raised the alarm. A Coastguard team were on scene and hauled him to safety - just as the incoming tide threatened to submerge him.  Humberside Police blocked the area in order for coastguards to carry out the rescue from land and from the river. Martyn, a Doncaster-area warehouseman, told Grimsby Live: We are very lucky. I was up to my knees when they got me out. Another five minutes and I would have been under the water. I am very grateful to the Coastguard.  He said: I saw Sandy end up on the mud. I could see he was sinking, so I went after him. As I got closer my legs got stuck. Both my legs went under. Luckily the Coastguards came quickly and they were able to dig me out. He added: Sandy had got himself free. I hadnapost needed to go to him after all.

The married pair were taking part in the Queenaposs Commonwealth Trust video call when Harry made the tongue in cheek claim.Harry said: Iaposm ageing, right, Iaposm  already. Meghan, , found the funny side as she quickly interjected Thataposs not ageing!. It is ageing compared to these guys he replied, referring to the other participants on the call as they discussed issues related to Black Lives Matter. Earlier, Meghan said people needed to push through an uncomfortable phase towards equality as she spoke candidly about the issues. The couple joined Chrisann Jarrett, co-founder of We Belong, which is led by young people who migrated to the UK, and Alicia Wallace, director of Equality Bahamas. Also on the July  chat were Mike Omoniyi, founder of The Common Sense Network and Abdullahi Alim, who leads the World Economic Forumaposs Global Shapers. The duke told them: When you look across the Commonwealth, there is no way that we can move forward unless we acknowledge the past. So many people have done such an incredible job of acknowledging the past and trying to right those wrongs, but I think we all acknowledge there is so much more still to do.  Itaposs not going to be easy and in some cases itaposs not going to be comfortable, but it needs to be done, because, guess what, everybody benefits. Former Suits star Meghan spoke of how equality was a fundamental human right. Weaposre going to have to be a little uncomfortable right now, because itaposs only in pushing through that discomfort that we get to the other side of this and find the place where a high tide raises all ships, she said. Equality does not put anyone on the back foot, it puts us all on the same footing - which is a fundamental human right. Harry addresses the issue of unconscious bias, sharing his own perspective.  We canapost deny or ignore the fact that all of us have been educated to see the world dferently, he said. However, once you start to realise that there is that bias there, then you need to acknowledge it, you need to do the work to become more aware ... so that you can help stand up for something that is so wrong and should not be acceptable in our society today. After the Sussexes stepped down as a senior working royals, Harry had to leave his role as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.

Tables with indoor cushioned chairs in a chained off area in what appears to be a car park behind the venue have been slapped together to take advantage of new Government rules, reports the Daily Record. It comes as Scots were given the greenlight toto the pub for the first time in almost four months. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Sharing a picture on social media, Craig Campbell said: Nice beer garden in Motherwellanyone fancies a pint. Pubs, restaurants and cafes can now open their outdoor facilities for service as part of the Scottish Governmentaposs route map out of lockdown. On Monday, thousands of Scots up and down the country flocked to boozers with outdoor areas to enjoy a pint and a chat.  Indoor seating areas will continue to remain closed until at least July  as the Scottish Government hopes to move into phase three of its lockdown easing plan. Nicola Sturgeon has urged Scots to remain vigilant when taking a trip to the pub.The Scottish First Minister visited the Cold Town House in Edinburgh on Monday to see new safety measures put in place to protect against the spread of coronavirus. Drinkers queued for more than a hour to get into beer gardens as they reopened across Scotland on Monday. She urged people to comply with measures in place to protect against coronavirus at the newly reopened sites, such as giving names and contact details, or to stay at home. She said: I hope that as we take these first gradual steps out of lockdown people will begin to feel more of the sense of normality that we have worked so hard for - although it is important to remember that the virus has not gone away so we cannot get complacent.

The rampaging cyclone is currently churning through the Atlantic Ocean and is set to reach the UK by Thursday on the back of two straight days of showers. However, parts of the country will see highs of C today with plenty of humidity despite the likelihood of rain - while next week could see Britain top C, according to some forecasters.Netweather weather charts show temperatures hitting C between next Sunday and July  but the forecaster has also indicated C is possible.While BBC weather maps suggest highs of C in London by Tuesday next week with the south set to see several days of warm and dry weather. And the Met Officeaposs long range forecast states: Temperatures are likely to be either around or on the warmer side of average, with the warmest conditions likely in the southeast. BBC meteorologist Chris Fawkes, meanwhile, said two lumps of cloud are set to bring rain for today and tomorrow before Edouard arrives, with no sign of the weather settling down just yet. He said Tuesday will see thicker cloud edging in and once the rainaposs set in itaposs going to be windy for much of the day - with wind gusts hitting mph by the evening, according to the Met Office.London will see the best of the heat and humidity today, but sunshine is also likely in Scotland before showers move in by the afternoon. Mr Fawkes said the rain will become a little more confined to the south on Wednesday and will continue in pulses - light one minute and then a bit heavier.  Then Edouard - who will be considerably less energised by the time he reaches Britain - will bring more rain. The Environment Agency has issued one flood alert in London today, affecting the Thames between Putney Bridge and Teddington Weir, and a flood warning in Keswick, Cumbria. UK  day weather forecast Today: Early cloud and rain over Ireland will spread eastwards across much of England and Wales, rain heavy at times in the west. Southern UK staying dry with some bright spells. Sunny spells for Scotland, but also a few sharp showers. Tonight: Early evening rain over Wales and northern and central England sinking southwards into southern UK. Some heavy rain in West Wales. Scotland drier, clearer and chilly.

Record-breakers Ronnie and Donnie Gaylon passed away in a hospice in their hometown of Dayton, Ohio on July . Born on October , , Ronnie and Donnie - who are joined at the sternum and the abdomen, with one set of lower digestive organs - spent the first two years of their lives in hospital. Parents Eileen and Wesley Gaylon had refused to allow doctors to attempt to separate the brothers after they could not provide a guarantee they would both survive. At three, they joined King of the Sideshow Ward Hallaposs infamous aposWorld of Wondersapos carnival tour, billed as aposGaylon Siamese twinsapos as a way of helping support their parentsapos nine kids and paying off medical bills. They remained on the circuit until  - with their act largely consisting of sitting around in a trailer and watching TV while customers paid to watch from the window. Their whole lives in sync, they had to work together to complete everyday tasks, initially being trained by occupational therapists.  However, the twins did not receive any formal education, with local schools deeming them too much of a distraction for the other children. According to some reports, their mother Eileen never accepted them, but they found a close community among the other sideshow performers. As times changed in the US into the s, carnival acts were shted to the wayside and the twins instead moved to Central and South America where they became like rock stars. They never married and always maintained they had remained best friends throughout - despite many physical fights during their teens.

Local media state when residents try and clean the swing the elderly woman has attacked them with a shovel. They also claim she has even tried to dig the swing out by herself in the past, but failed.

They typically spend their lives in one-metre-squared battery cages and are only moved twice – for weaning and on the day they die. Since a  fur farming ban in the UK, pelts worth £million have been imported. Much of the fur comes from China, the US, France, Italy and Poland. In  almost £m of animal fur was imported, including £.m from China alone. Today the Daily Mirror is calling for an immediate ban on the sale of fur products in the UK. Joining forces with Humane Society International UK, we also want an end to animals being trapped for their skins here, and repercussions for businesses knowingly passing off real fur as fake. The footage was captured by the charity’s investigators. The exact location has not been revealed to protect their identity for fear of punishment. One of the team said: “I’ve never seen so much death in one place. It really shocked me and I had to steady myself to keep filming. “There was a mountain of dead bodies, there must have been  tens of thousands of animals discarded like rubbish, like their lives meant nothing.”  He also captured animals repetitively pacing and swaying their heads, classic signs of mental distress and boredom. Animals are kept in rows of cages in long sheds exposed to the elements. Cages are barren apart from the faeces on the floor. Water dishes were also empty. But that is the least of their problems. When the foxes and raccoon dogs are a year old and their winter coats have developed, they are repeatedly smashed over the head with a metal bar while terried cage mates helplessly bark. Investigators also captured what experts say is strong evidence of a fox regaining consciousness after being fully skinned and thrown on a pile.  HSI UK veterinary consultant Professor Alastair MacMillan said: “The pain of that would be unimaginable. This footage is absolutely appalling. The stunning and slaughtering process is done with such a flagrant lack of skill or care, making it highly likely that many of these foxes did not lose consciousness and suffered severe pain. “Equally, a signicant proportion could have regained consciousness before, during and even after they had been skinned.” Packham gave his backing to the sales ban campaign, saying: “I am astonished at the depravity of the fur trade. It is like a scene from hell and anyone who knowingly wears fur should not turn away from watching it. Aside from the unbelievable cruelty of their deaths, these foxes and raccoon dogs will have endured utterly miserable lives. “There can be no place in British shops and wardrobes for fur, not when this is the price animals pay.”  The world’s total fur sales in  totalled £.billion, according to the Fur Information Council of America. Some fur creations were seen on the catwalks at Milan Fashion Week this year but designers including Prada, Gucci, Armani, Versace, Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, DKNY, Burberry and Chanel have ditched it. In , Calornia became the first US state to ban fur sales. This year, Hawaii and Rhode Island followed. Many British retailers are actively fur-free but clothes, shoes and accessories made of fur can still be found on the high street and online – whether the buyer knows it or not. A Daily Mirror investigation found real fur clothes masquerading as fake, made from the pelts of foxes, rabbits and raccoon dogs, from as little as £ in shopping centres and markets.  It is estimated % of China’s wildle trade is dedicated to fur production, making it the world’s biggest.In the Netherlands,  mink fur farms have been closed down after animals were confirmed as infected with the coronavirus strain that causes Covid-. More than , mink were culled by government order.Three farms in Denmark infected with the coronavirus are also shut. Claire Bass, executive director of Humane Society International UK said: “Behind the PR spin of the fur trade, this is the hideous, heartless reality they don’t want you to see.  “Raccoon dogs driven mad with boredom in their pitully small wire cages, foxes repeatedly smashed over the head with a metal bar in front of their terried cage mates, animals skinned alive so that the fur trade can sell consumers the lie of luxury. “I am sickened and heartbroken by what our investigators witnessed on these cruel farms, but not surprised.“Every designer putting fur on the catwalk, every retailer putting fur on its shop shelves, and everyconsumer putting fur in their wardrobe, is helping to pay for this shameful misery.“It needs to stop, and the UK is now in a unique position to take action by banning fur sales.

In a bizarre saga reminiscent of the Tom Hanks film The Terminal, the Estonian national claims to have been eating and sleeping in Manila airport for months and washing in the bathrooms. He is pleading to be rescued from the airport, where he has been in limbo since he arrived on an AirAsia flight from Bangkok on March . Mr Trofimov can be seen sporting a long beard and shaggy hair in viral Facebook posts documenting his plight - in which he claims to be surviving on food and snacks donated by airport staff. He shared pictures of his aposmealsapos of bottled water and chocolate bars on social media, claiming he has been told he must stay put until local quarantine rules change as he begs for help. The stranded tourist claims the airport is like a ghost-town - with staff rarely to be seen, and most flights grounded. Mr Trofimov claims he had to sleep on the terminalaposs floor and on metal benches at first. Eventually the Estonian consulate stepped in to help him be transferred to the passenger lounge on April , he said.According to ERR media he hails from the eastern Estonian town of Jõhvi.He first arrived in southeast Asia via Thailand, in a transfer from Novosibirsk, Russia.According to his series of Facebook posts, Mr Trofimov claims he saved up a year for the dream trip. He was travelling in Southeast Asia when coronavirus lockdowns began kicking in, and he claims his passport was taken before going through immigration. The airline he flew in on was also unable tohim to Thailand as flights around the world were being grounded due to fears over the deadly virus. He claims he was then denied entry into the Philippines due to entry visas no longer being issued for arrivals as Covid- began ramping up its march around the globe. Mr Trofimov was among travellers around the world caught up in the chaos as airlines halted travel and countries rush to close their borders.  While most tourists stranded managed to jet home on last-minute flights or were repatriated by their governments, Mr Trofimov claims to have been struck ever since. His plight is eerily similar to the plot of the -comedy Terminal, in which Hanksapos character Viktor Narovski is stuck in New Yorkaposs John F. Kennedy Airport terminal for months due to a military coup in his home country, an Eastern European state that is never named. Mr Trofimov likened his own situation to being a prisoner.  Documenting his plight, he said: aposaposIaposve been stuck here for more than  days. I need help getting out. The airline said I need to wait for Enhanced Community Quarantine to be over before I am allowed to fly. Iaposve been waiting here ever since.aposapos Mr Trofimov claimed he had an onward flight to Cebu province booked for the same day on March  and aflight to Bangkok for April . But both were cancelled.  The desperate tourist said he had asked his embassy for help but they were unable to organise a repatriation flight. Coronavirus restrictions have been implemented in the Philippines according to the risk level of each region. TheManila, where the airport is located, was under the Enhanced Community Quarantinefor a few months before it shted to a lower level General Community Quarantine in June. However, despite having a more relaxed guideline under the GCQ status, most flights are still not allowed to resume - including to Estonia. Mr Trofimov, who has a bad back,added: I am a person with disability, my health is getting worse because of malnutrition, lack of sun, and fresh air. I have no other choice, but to go public please share with news agencies.According to ERR, Mr Trofimov explained he had been hoping to travel in southeast Asia for months before he got stuck. He said: This was my dream. I compared both Thailand and the Philippines and couldnapost decide which country would be better to travel to for months to free myself of stress and the hustle and bustle of the city that my nerves couldnapost take anymore.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Estonian media it is aware of Trofimovaposs situation and is looking for a way tohim home. The ministry told ERR they were made aware of Trofimovaposs situation on March , when the man had reached Manila Airport, where he was not allowed further entry to the country due to travel restrictions. Estonian officials told news site ERR it is trying to help Trofimov organise a flight after he initially declined toto Estonia, but has since expressed a desire toto country.

In her stocking soles, Rentsenkhorloo, , stands ft in tall. And her legs measure .ins from hip to heel, just short of the ins world record held by -year-old Maci Currin, from Austin, Texas. Rentsenkhorloo, who is originally from Mongolia and now lives in Chicago, comes from a tall family, her dad ft in and mum, ft in. But rather than hide her legs, Ren loves nothing more than to show them off in shorts and high heels. Ren said: “I like to wear shorts and high heels especially so my legs look more long. “I love my long legs, and I think they make me more beautul.” Although Ren believes she has the longest legs in the world she insists she has no desire to enter the Guinness Book of World Records. She said: “Iaposm not planning to do it because I donapost have any interest in it.” Being above average height comes with its fair share of challenges: from finding clothes that fit to being too big for doorways, Ren’s extraordinary height means she sometimes quite literally doesn’t fit in with the world. Ren said: “The doorways are so short for me. I hate to hit my head on doorways! Finding clothes is really challenging. My shoe size is US  and you can’t find any shoes in Asia and even in Mongolia and Korea.  I tried to go shopping in the United States a few times when I came here, but I couldnapost find any clothes. “I just try to buy some clothes online. “Even when I was in the first grade, I was the same height as my teacher - cm. I was a little girl and I wanted cute clothes, but you canapost find any cute clothes in this age, in this size.” Although Ren wasn’t bullied at school, she admits feeling less positive about her height when she was younger.  She said: “When I was younger, I felt so bad because of my height. Some people made me feel uncomfortable, but nowadays it seems like Iaposm seen more as unique, so thataposs why I feel so good. “In the last  years, I started to like my height and Iaposm really comfortable with my body and also long legs.” And having been tall all her le, Ren couldn’t imagine being any other way. “I live with my long legs, and my tall height my entire le. So, I think itaposs just a normal thing for me.” And now Ren has even had the opportunity to do some modelling work.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances. Every penny needed to keep these two lesavers in the air seven days a week,  days a year, is donated by the people of Scotland. We receive no statutory government funding.Yet, as I reflect on how the Scottish public has risen to every request we have made of them over the past seven years, I feel confident they will not abandon #The People#s Helicopter# at this particular time of need.Please support SCAAyou can and help us celebrate the seventh anniversary of this lesaving service # your service.John Bullough, Chairman, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance, Perth Airport.Sir,Volunteers are always important.

But this hasn#t stopped our volunteers from supporting young people. So many of our brilliant leaders are still running meetings online, helping Scouts catch up with their friends and continue to earn their awards.At a time when our children#s lives are so badly disrupted, these sessions are providing a sense of normality and continuity that#s so important for their well-being.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

not reflecting the sunrsquos rays.The eclipse will be visible over ScotlandAccording to TimeAndDate, a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and moon are imperfectly aligned.When this happens, the earth blocks some of the sunrsquos light from directly reaching the moonrsquos surface, and covers all or part of the moon with the other part of its shadow.People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be seen along a narrow path from a small part of the earth, eclipses of the moon can be observed all across the night side of earth when the eclipse happens.According to TimeAndDate, these are the local times to see the penumbral lunar

Not even the number  night bus that trundles through Port Seton on an hourly basis.Was it the silence that was keeping me awake  Or was it the fact that, by this time, my mind was racing ahead to the things that I had to do the next day In these recent months, one of the most common things to hear people say is that their sleeping pattern isnrsquot what it once was.I even Googled it and came across an article from a popular news website in which those interviewed recounted how the events of recent months had affected their ability to sleep.It seems that much of this has been caused by the changes to our daily routine.As we have been spending more time at home than usual, wersquore not expending the same energy as we do when times are more lsquonormalrsquo.Even sunny days, when we would normally go out and soak up the sun, are often spent inside the coolness of our homes.And,we are honest, we probably need to add into the mix a certain measure of anxiety.It is not easy to hear even the improving facts and figures that are circulated each day, nor to be reminded that, whilst things might be looking up, such a situation relies on our continued responsible behaviour.As I lay awake, which included thinking about what I would put into this column that you are now reading, I was reminded of the Psalmist in the Old Testament who confesses that sometimes he too lies awake at night, his mind buzzing around from here to there.So, what does he do when he cannot sleep Psalm  and verse : ldquoOn my bed I remember you I think of you through the watches of the night.He turns his attention to God. Something worth considering as we too doze on and off in the wee small hours."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-st-andrews-old-kirk","story":"The fallen-down walls and tall standing central gable give it a very picturesque quality, perfectly situated just beyond the edge of the golf course.I may be wrong, but I suspect it is not really a place many people purposely go to visit. As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits. My kids are fascinated by the stories told on the gravestones.As the lockdown eases, we are all understandably desperate to get out from our confinement and feel free once again to enjoy places. But then we often too readily build a new prison for ourselves by following the herd to overcrowded places where we are crammed into lsquomust-go-torsquo popular places.Maybe a gt from the lockdown is the discovery of those places nearby, less well known, but in their own way special and magical.For me, East Lothian is full of such small, less-well-known, special places, that will never be a on a lsquomust-seersquo list, but are all the more enjoyable for it. This old ruin is one of them for me.It is such places I look forward to visiting as the lockdown eases."},{"url":null,"title":"farewell-alfred-alf-tesoro","story":"He died suddenly of a presumed heart attack at the age of , as he ed to his home in Eskside West after buying his daily newspaper on June .Due to current Covid- restrictions, a private service was conducted on Monday, June , at Inveresk Cemetery by Father Basil Clark, from Our Lady of Loretto Church on Newbigging, Musselburgh.The funeral cortegravege travelled along North High Street, passing his former cafe premises for the last time, to applause from members of the local community who lined the street to pay their respects.His niece Anita Cullinan said: ldquoOur family were truly touched by all who turned up to witness Alfrsquos last journey through Musselburgh ndash people who perhaps personally knew Alf or who had grown up during the years the shop was open.ldquoWersquod like to thank them for turning out and for the deeply respectful applause as the cortegravege passed by.Alf was born in the house above the shop on  North High Street on July , , the middle child of Edoardo Tesoro and Zelinda Costa Tesoro, whose other two children were Eolanda and Bert.Edoardo started the cafe known as A.Tesoro in , and his brother Emilio also started a Tesoro cafe across the bridge in Musselburgh around the same time.

They didnrsquot have a pasteurising machine until after the Second World War, which then allowed larger quantities to be made and stored.Ice was delivered to the cafe each day and kept in a cool cabinet and the ice cream was then made using a secret family recipe, passing from father to son.The ice cream was then delivered by horse and cart to ious places around Portobello and Musselburgh and also distributed by bicycles with cool boxes in front to keep it fresh.They had young lads helping to distribute the ice cream and family members remember Alf saying that they also attended the Musselburgh Racecourse events and dance halls to expand the business.Alf started a car mechanicrsquos course on New Street, Musselburgh, before the war but hadnrsquot completed it before being called up to serve in the British Army as a private in the Argyll  Sutherland Highlanders Regiment.He served in both France and Germany, arriving in Normandy on June , , and spending the rest of the war in France, Holland and Germany.He ed to Musselburgh with the intention to finish his apprenticeship and learn how to drive but, as was so often the case with the eldest son of Italian families at the time, was asked by his father to run the business.His sister, Eolanda, had finished her secretarial studies after the war and met a young Italian called Ricardo Paganuzzi, who she married and who set up an ice cream business called Dinorsquos Cafe in Perth.His younger brother, Bert, went on to study law at the University of Edinburgh after he finished his national service.He married an Edinburgh girl called Catherine OrsquoDonnell, who studied to be a teacher.Alf therefore found himself the last of the siblings left in the business and stayed to continue work until his retirement ndash around  years.After he retired and, in the absence of successors to run the business, he sold up around  and continued to spend his remaining  or so years living very happily in his native Musselburgh.He travelled to the USA and to Canada but mainly spent his annual holidays with his nephew, Dino Paganuzzi, in Switzerland.He went on numerous trips back with Dino to where their family originated, Beverino, in the region of La Spezia in northern Italy, where relatives still live.He announced very shortly after ing from a family trip to Rome that his travelling days were now over, at the age of nearly .Alf was a member of the hiking club run by Our Lady of Loretto Catholic Church, where he seldom missed a Sunday Mass.He also spent many a Saturday at Easter Road in Edinburgh with his brother Bert, watching his beloved Hibs play football.Alf is survived by his nephew Dino Paganuzzi in Switzerland, niece Anita Cullinan, from Edinburgh, cousin Roland Toma, of the Cafe Continental in Gourock, cousin Elena Grippa in Rome, and their children.Many Musselburgh residents took to social media to pay tribute to Alf. Fiona Rutherford posted: ldquoLoved his cafe.Gillian Duffy said: ldquoAlways used to be the place to hang out at Alfiersquos when a teenager.Alan Fraser said: ldquoBrilliant recognition by the people of Musselburgh.Elaine Black added: ldquoHappy memories.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Food factories and meat plants in the US, Europe and the UK have become Covid- hotspots. Most recently, a chicken plant in Anglesey, Wales, had to shut down when  employees tested positive out of a total workforce of .Expect the usual ldquoI told you so interpretation of this phenomenon from vegan propagandists who seize any opportunity to frame their usual suspect: meat production. But itrsquos not the type of food ndash animal or plant-based ndash these factories handle that creates the problem.One suspected cluster of cases, for instance, has occurred in a Chinese factory that manufactures crisps. Itrsquos the physical set-up.Food factories donrsquot do Doors Open Days, and for good reason. If we saw how the products we buy, so slickly presented on supermarket shelves, were produced inside such places, it would kill our appetite for them.When I was researching my book Swallow This, which investigates the processed food industry, I inveigled myself into several factories that supply the major multiples, and take it from me, itrsquos no mystery why people get ill working in such environments, or why they have such high staff turnovers. They are horrible places to work in. Food manufacturers want us to think that these factories are just like a scaled up version of a domestic kitchen. But they more resemble car plants and oil refineries, or even the missile-launching pad at the end of Dr No, where James Bond sabotages the efforts of a small army of operatives, lost and almost robotic-looking inside their bulky protective clothing.Whether theyrsquore turning out packs of chicken pieces or vegan lasagna, chilled food factories operate in similar ways. To inhibit the growth of dangerous food poisoning bacteria, such as campylobacter and listeria, the ambient temperature in most zones of food factories is bitingly raw and cold. It chills you down to the bone marrow. Covid- appears to love such conditions. So therersquos problem number one.Thanks to the sheer scale and heft of the machinery in these factories, the noise is deafening. Staff usually get given ear plugs, but when they do have to communicate, they have to shout. Shouting appears to increase the risk of spreading coronavirus problem number two.Problem number three  Letrsquos call it inadequate physical distancing because therersquos nothing sociable about standing closely on a factory line arranging vegan nuggets on trays, or checking that each jalfrezi barbecue skewer has the stipulated four chunks of meat.I wouldnrsquot last an hour in one of these places, let alone get through the demanding shts that workers typically put in ndash  hours isnrsquot unusual, sometimes nightsht. Thatrsquos problem four right there: factory workers have protracted exposure in circumstances where coronavirus flourishes.And that includes sharing tables in the canteen. The one I saw was small and intimate compared to the factory floor. Its dish of the day was bigos, the Polish meat and sauerkraut stew.Housing presents us with problem five. Staff often share living quarters ndash basic accommodation is frequently part of the employment package ndash and workers are bussed from there to the factory and back again after their sht. The Unite union says that staff often struggle into work when they feel sick because theyrsquore scared of their pay being docked.Bottom line  Yoursquod need a very strong immune system to work in one of these factories at the very best of times, let alone when coronavirus is around.This should give us pause to think. The industrial food system didnrsquot create Covid-, but its workplaces are a vector for it. Surely an essential requirement for any sane food economy should be that it creates safe jobs for the people who work in it "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-get-back-basics-schools","story":"That prospect should concentrate the minds of those responsible for school education to focus on the essentials of education and to trim the surplus fat of the fripperies of the curriculum, which bog down the pace at which children learn.Having lost nearly six months of education, youngsters will have to be reintroduced via revision to the essential elements to revitalise their knowledge before introducing the next rungs on the ladder of education to them.Knowing that education could well be disrupted over the winter months by a resurgence of the virus, primary teachers should lay strong emphasis upon laying the solid foundations of literacy and numeracy or, in old-fashioned parlance, reading, writing and arithmetic, without which there cannot be any effective progress in any other discipline.Secondary schools would be well advised to focus upon English, maths, sciences languages and IT, until such times as there is an effective vaccine to restore normality to everyday le.Teachers outwith those five areas could be utilised, according to their proficiency in one or more of those areas at their lower levels, to release the specialists to impart their knowledge and expertise to those students who are preparing to face state exams..As long as the threat of a second spike remains, there is a challenge to be faced in education.Until that is resolved, it will be necessary to resile from the modern relaxed approach adopted in education today, which seems to have pupils spending their valuable time in reinventing the wheel..Teacher-led instruction in a streamlined curriculum should take pole position in our straitened circumstances today to protect the future prospects of our youngsters.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.THE VAN GUARDI WAS a long-time caravamner and, up until a few years ago, a member of the Caravan and Camping Club.

So should we all be.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh EH.I AM currently writing from Germany, where I arrived about a fortnight ago. I was due to fly home with Eurowings from Cologne to Edinburgh on July . After my arrival in Germany, Eurowings cancelled the flight as a result of the UK quarantine requirements and a subsequent slump in demand. The airline has removed all flights to Scotland until August.I had hoped Eurowings would reinstate the service to Edinburgh once quarantine restrictions are lted for countries with a low Covid- infection rate ndash countries such as Germany. Now we learn that the quarantine will indeed be lted from July , but for England only.Nicola Sturgeons refusal to agree to end quarantine in line with Westminster means that there is no real prospect that Eurowings will relaunch flights to Scotland any time soon. In practice it means that I wont get back to Scotland with this airline and, in order to remain stranded here for the foreseeable time, Irsquoll have to pay for an expensive one-way flight with a dferent airline.My stay in Germany is by no means a leisure trip. There will be more people like me who travel for essential family and business reasons and now have to put up with more unnecessary uncertainty, inconvenience and extra cost just because the SNP and other devolved governments are in a huff.Withholding agreement to end this flawed quarantine policy for countries like Germany, which have a demonstrably better record on dealing with the pandemic and a sustained lower infection rate than Scotland, is simply unacceptable and a slap in face of our partners in the EU and beyond, effectively telling them that Scotland is firmly closed for business.Thankfully the UK Government has seen sense and ends quarantine for international travellers. Meanwhile I live in the hope that discussions between Westminster and the devolved administrations will lead to the Edinburgh Government giving up its nonsensical stance on this issue.Regina Erich, c o Essen, Germany, permanent address Stonehaven.ONCE again Nicola Sturgeon has criticised the most recent UK Governmentrsquos Covid- announcement, the air bridges quarantine policy .She certainly knew in advance that a policy was imminent and she may have a point that the Scottish Government was given little or no time to study it. However, now she wants time to fully peruse and examine the policy before either agreeing with it or dismissing it. My guess is that she will agree with it but it will probably not be introduced to Scotland until the usual one week later than England. We always seem to be trailing England, but again she always maintains that we have got to be safe and must not jump into decisions.The questions that arise are as follows. Why did the Scottish Government not draw up its own list of countries where an air bridge could be introduced  Would that have been too dficult, or is it because Ms Sturgeon wants the UK Government to do the research and development, so that she can be in a position to criticise Why are Scottish families who are now into the formal school holidays having to wait for her decision  As the schools willin mid-August, the clock is tickingthey want to get away for a European holiday, so delaying it will not give them much of an opportunity for an overseas break.It would certainly be very positive, and welcome,for once Ms Sturgeon could agree at once with a Covid- policy that originated from the UK Government. As our Prime Minister has stated the devolved governments are generally following the same route, the only thing is that we seem to be trailing behind as usual.

Such a isive assertion is absolute nonsense which in itself can only give rise to ill-feeling.It may well be the case that many of us domiciled in Scotland disapprove strongly of the approach of the hyper-nationalist clique in power in Westminster to such issues as immigration, Brexit, the handling of the pandemic, relationships with Donald Trump and Britainrsquos role in the world. That disapproval is shared with many in England, and thus should not be associated with nationalist sentiment north of the Border.John Milne, Uddingston.ACCORDING to David McEwan Hillhe was \"confused\" after reading the excellent letter from Dr Gerald Edwardsand then went on to make some astonishing claims about the Scottish economy. For example, he claimed that \"Scotland provides  per cent of the UKs exports\".

He then made a lot of play about Scotland exporting power to England but failed to mention that most of the wind power is subsidised by the English taxpayersand with little back-up powerwill become very reliant on rUK for power.With regard to his comment about Scotland being the only \"viable economic unit\" in the UK when most people understand that London and the south-east of England are in a league of their own is equally laughable ndash notwithstanding the fact our fiscal deficitwas five times that of rUK.But he keeps the best to last with his assertionis that England somehow wants to \"hang on to us\". Perhaps he forgot it was the Scottish people who voted for us to remain in the Union, not the English.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.DAVID McEwan Hill writes that \"Scotland provides  per cent of the UKs exports, has a higher per capita in manufacturing base, feeds itself ...\".While I dont know whether the first two parts quoted above are factual or not, I think Im on safe ground challenging the part where Mr Hill would have us believe Scotland feeds itself.From looking on the ious shelves of my local supermarket I can see all manner of produce from countries other than Scotland.The UK may well import more than  per cent of its food, but given Scotland is part of the UK, it is likely Scotland also imports a similar percentage of food.And as for Scotland being the only viable economic unit in the UK, I believe Mr Hill may be suffering from an overdose of SNP independence propaganda.Brian Bell, Kinross.Read more: Struan Stevenson: Johnson has shown the way forward"},{"url":null,"title":"politics-watch-hugs-hairdos-talk-tv-steamie","story":"There was none of that, however, with both presenters the picture of smooth professionalism, eventhey had clearly failed to bag a hair appointment ndash unlike Matt Hancock, Englandrsquos Health Secretary.ldquoI had my hair cut yesterday and Irsquom very relieved about it, he told Ridge proudly en route to The Andrew Marr Show.On the BBC programme the Minister was, unusually, not top of the bill.

It also shows that, in the general population in England, support for independence is at %, which is interesting because thatrsquos broadly where support for Scottish independence was in Scotland  years ago. In other words, this could be the beginning of a new trend in England, who knows.In other ways, the poll is only confirming what we know already: the highest support for nationalism and independence in England comes from voters who lean to the right whereas in Scotland, it generally comes from the left. But that doesnrsquot mean wersquore dealing with completely dferent beasts here. Far from it: there are striking similarities between the instincts of some English Tories and Scottish nationalists and they help explain two things: why the parties behave as they do, and why there is a large group of voters they struggle to reach.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeIn the case of the Conservative Party, English Tories ndash like Scottish nationalists ndash have always possessed a strong sense of national identity, sometimes romantic, sometimes bellicose. At party conferences, Tories are unselfconscious about bellowing out Land of Hope and Glory in the way that Scottish nationalists are unselfconscious about Flower of Scotland. The leaders of the Tory party have also always known the power of English iconography ndash Stanley Baldwin used to talk about ldquothe tinkle of the hammer on the anvil and the call of the corncrake on a dewy morning ndash just as SNP leaders know the power, for some, of tartan and bagpipes.Politically, Tory leaders ndash again, like leaders of the SNP ndash have also always been aware of the usefulness of national identity . Disraeli said he had ldquoalways considered that the Tory party was the national party of England and a few years later leading Tories set up the Patriotic Association with a weekly paper called ldquoEngland. Some  years later, Boris Johnson tapped into exactly the same English patriotism to fuel support for the campaign to leave the European Union just as the SNP taps into Scottish patriotism to fuel support for leaving the UK.The leadership of both the Tories and the SNP are also aware of the trick, because it works for some people, of using national identity to denigrate their opponents as un-English, un-Scottish, un-patriotic or un-something . Disraeli said Liberalismrsquos aim was to ldquoeffect the disintegration of the Empire of England whereas the leadership of the SNP frequently accuse their opponents of failing to stand up for Scotland or doing it down. Itrsquos all the same kind of stuff really, whether itrsquos English or Scottish or British: nationalism as a stirrer of intense passions and a political recruiter.But it only goes so far, because not everyone is stirred by nationalistic sentiments: some hearts soar but some hearts sink, and that poses a problem for politicians of a nationalistic bent. Strident types of English, or Scottish, nationalism have always been unattractive to many liberals and voters who occupy the crucial centre ground ndash the kind that the SNP in particular needs to recruit. More recently, some of the more liberal Tory leaders have also struggled in  for example, Alex Salmond showed no shame or embarrassment in his patriotism and nationalism, while for David Cameron it was all a bit squirmy and awkward.Whatrsquos happening is that all of this creates issues for centrist politicians who oppose nationalism, like Cameron in  or Keir Starmer in , particularly when, in all its forms, nationalism appears to be on the rise. However, it also poses problems for English Tories and Scottish nationalists who seek to exploit it ndash and it may explain why support for Brexit and Scottish independence both hover around % but not much higher.Take Nicola Sturgeon for example. She knows that sounding stridently nationalistic will attract some Scots to her cause but she also knows that sounding too nationalistic could turn off the centrists she needs to win over. Keir Starmer has a similar problem for Labour, only in a dferent direction. He knows that sounding more obviously patriotic could win back some of the support from English nationalists whorsquove gone over to the Tories, particularly in the north of England, but he also knows thathe goes too far, he risks losing support from centrists, particularly in London and, crucially, Scotland.To make matters worse in Scotland, therersquos another problem here, which is that English nationalism may also be fuelling Scottish nationalism or at least support for the SNP. The most recent poll at the weekend confirms support for independence at around % and support for the SNP high enough to win them another election, and much of this has been fuelled by Brexit which in turn has been fuelled by English nationalism.:Support for Scottish independence surges in new poll as SNP look set for landslide victory at Holyrood electionsThe question is how resilient the centre will be in the face of all of this. Clearly, some of the centre ground in Scotland is being eaten away by the SNP, and in a UK context itrsquos left Labour in particular with a dilemma. On English nationalism, one of the solutions that the partyrsquos election review considers is tacking to the centre on economic policy while talking up the partyrsquos patriotic credentials the push and pull of nationalism and unionism is also the reason Labour has been talking about the idea of ldquoradical federalism.But will it be enough  The fear for centrists must be that as English nationalism closes in on one side and Scottish nationalism closes in on the other, like the walls of the trash compactor in Star Wars, the centre will get squished. In a constitutionally eccentric country like the UK, itrsquos also unclear what the centrists can do. One option is to sound more nationalistic, but that may hasten the crushing. The other is to continue to call for another way. But as the walls close in, they may not be heard over the noise.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

And dramatically so.Some are abandoning the old complexities of mainstream unionism, of Britain as a ldquofamily of nations, of a plurinational state, of a country made up of countries.In its place comes a new and sometimes shrill insistence that the UK is a unitary nation-state.ldquoThis is not unionism, Mr Keating said. ldquoIt is British nationalism.:Opinion: Mark Smith: Take a good look at the Tories who support English independence because it is Scotlandrsquos story tooMr Keating is one of the greatest scholars of British unionism.

Why are Tory MPs trying to say these things about the border ldquoWe have this strident rhetoric where anything that looks like a border is a violation of their conception of union.ldquoMy argument is that the Union is in a bad way. There used to be an understanding of what the UK was.ldquoEven in the days when some were resisting devolution, there was this idea that there was a union of nations, not a unitary state.ldquoSo the nations were dferentiated in lots of dferent ways.ldquoIn a nation-state, you have a demos, a people a telos, which is a shared purpose an ethos, shared values and a principle of sovereignty. And these things are all in the same place.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeldquoThe UK was never like that.Since devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unionists, said Mr Keating, have struggled to define the Union.Devolution has dented centralised sovereignty in Westminster ndash even as Brexiters seek to repatriate powers from Brussels.And ndash as the Covid crisis has underlined ndash it has led to policy ergence across the UK that makes some of the new breed of unionists uncomfortable.Mr Keating summed up: ldquoOn the one hand this group of unionists are doubling down on parliamentary sovereignty and on the other hand they are pushing a Britishness.ldquoWhat they are saying, in my language, is that the UK has a demos, the British people a telos, that we agree on what the constitution is an ethos, what they call British values and a principle of sovereignty.\"So unionism, which was never a nationalism, has become a nationalism.This, for Keating, presents a problem.The UK used to allow huge flexibility in identity, something the helped deliver the Good Friday Peace Agreement or the Welsh and Scottish devolved parliaments.ldquoIt was never required for us all to sign up to all these bits of Britishness, he explained.ldquoThat was the genius of the UK in the past. Mainstream unionism has always accepted dferences.Authorities across the UK have followed broadly similar policies on tackling Covid.However, even minor dferences in practice and policy have been highlighted by unionist politicians across all four nations as decentralisation became more politically salient than ever before.:Why has it taken a pandemic for anti-devolution views to go viral ldquoCovid has raised all of this.

budget, the Scottish Government allocated pound million to fund the college sector with a further pound.m to be spent on college capital needs.But what we saw as the coronavirus outbreak started, illustrated perfectly just how well spent that money has been in creating this highly innovative national resource.How Scotlandrsquos colleges switched incredibly swtly to digital teaching and assessment was a brilliant shop window of their adaptive skills, as we all moved into new ways of operating and thinking.Their students and staff then rose just as impressively to the complex everyday challenges presented by Covid, by offering their time, skills and much-needed materials such as personal protective equipment to both the NHS, and to some of the most vulnerable members of their own communities, to first react and now recover, via social care and community organisations.Their skills also came to the fore by addressing some complex engineering and other disciplines brought into play, for ious sectors to react to the crisis.How our college sector emerges now from Covid- will have ahuge influence on how we do as a country.Thatrsquos why throughout the crisis, I have been meeting regularly with college principals, unions and student representatives to ensure every practical effort is being made for them to resurface in good shape ready for next term, so they can remain at the forefront of our economic recovery.We are publishing new guidance this week to help Scotlandrsquos collegesprepare their staff and students for a safe and phasedin the new term, using a blended model of remote and limited on-campus learning.The flexibility and professionalism colleges have shown in the past  days has demonstrated they are more than well equipped to provide not only a safe working environment for everyone, but to support students in their studies with the highest quality of learning and teaching.I have been a proud Further and Higher Education Minister as I watched our network react so brilliantly to the Covid crisis, and would like to thank them for that collective effort.I am of no doubt, whatever, they will continue to rise to the ongoing challenges of not only recovering from the effects of this once-in-a-letime situation but continuing to provide the productive pipeline of the talent we need to prosper as an economy.Richard Lochhead is Scotlandrsquos Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-andy-mciver-unionists-given-just-asleep","story":"Inasmuch as truth is relevant in the puerility of Scottish constitutional debate, I feel compelled to begin with my view on the matter.I am not exercised by constitutional politics. Nationality, for me, evokes contentedness, at best, rather than pride. I canrsquot get excited about which flags fly on buildings, what colour my passport is, or whether a copy of The Gruffalo is available in Scots. Indeed, I find the all-too-prevalent Scottish and British exceptionalism cringeworthy and insular, especially in those areas where we claim world-leading status when all the sensible evidence points to the contrary.Although I would have been prepared to vote Yes, I voted No in  based solely on my view that Scotlandrsquos inherited fiscal deficit combined with the leftism of a new, ideologised nation would leave me and my family poorer for a signicant period of time.:Support for Scottish independence surges in new poll as SNP look set for landslide victory at Holyrood electionsThe  campaign made me feel that a Yes vote would be an act of personal self-harm a virtue signalling affirmation of non-Englishness. The stuff of a second Scottish Enlightenment it was not.That said, polling trends are now clear enough to be sure that, slowly but most definitely surely, the country is moving towards independence. From the : position of , the No vote has gradually declined. Evenwe strip out polling during the pandemic, which may fairly be seen to be skewed by a seismic current event, numbers for No now normally tend to be in the low rather than the mid-fties.Since the peak of coronavirus passed, Yes has begun to build what may be seen as a psephologically consistent lead. This particular set of warning signs for unionistswere there in the polling conducted by Ipsos MORI for the BBC in May, in which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was given a net approval rating of % for her handling of the pandemic. Only one-in-eight people thought she was doing badly.That means, plainly, that a large number of died-in-the-wool unionists thought that Ms Sturgeon was doing a good job. As soon as I saw that poll I wondered whether unionist leaders north and south, who have long hitched their wagon to the negative perceptions of Ms Sturgeon that they claim to hear on the famous doorsteps, would understand the potential implications of their people offering her their approval, even during a crisis.The question in my head, now, is this: have the unionists given up, or are they just asleep at the wheel To be sure, positives for nationalists are plentul. Simple demographics play their part bluntly, young people are more likely to be ideological nationalists, and unionists are more likely to die. Secondly, without being pejorative about Boris Johnson, on whom the jury remains out, the very presence in Downing Street of a figure largely unpopular in Scotland also helps the case, especially when he and his partyrsquos demise still seems distant. And, thirdly, the uncertainty ushered in by Brexit, in a nation which did not vote for it, is another push factor for soft unionist Remainers.However it would also be a mistake to think that this most recent trend towards nationalism is particularly sticky. Ms Sturgeonrsquos communications around coronavirus has been as outstanding as it must have been exhausting, but her strategy has so far been a near carbon-copy of Mr Johnsonrsquos.During a crisis, opinions are transient and often frankly hysterical. So all should not be lost for unionists. And, yet, their prospects look bleak. Bleak not because of the last two months, or even the last two years, but as a result of decades of poor strategy, guided by emotional anti-nationalism rather than calm, clinical calculation.One word sums up British unionism: ldquoreactive. The Smith Commission was a reaction to the independence referendum result. The Calman Commission was a reaction to the SNP winning in . Devolution itself was a reaction to nationalist strength.Unionism is forever chasing the curve of Scottish public opinion. It is never ahead of it. It is never proactive. If it wants to save itself, it now needs to be. If unionists think they can just say no to indyref  and eventually it will all go away, theyrsquove not been paying attention.Unionism has some strong fundamentals in its favour. Firstly, it may well be the case that at any future independence referendum voter fatigue plays a signicant role. Scots have, in six years, been asked to decide upon their future in the UK and their future in the EU, have faced three general elections and a Scottish election, with another around the corner, not to mention enduring the coronavirus crisis, during which their job has a good chance of having been saved by a UK Chancellor. They might simply think ldquoenough is enough.That is, perhaps, rather a depressing reason to vote No. But there are more uplting ones. The transfer of such large volumes of No voters to Yes over recent years means that, by definition, a large proportion of the vote is soft. It can go back under the right conditions.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeThose right conditions, I think, inevitably involve the proactive creation of a New Unionism, discussed in some quarters but not so far ostensibly embraced by anyone with their hands on the levers of power.This New Unionism would read the changing mood, not just in Scotland but also in Northern Ireland and even to a degree in Wales, and try to get ahead of it. It would almost certainly move beyond the immature unionist debate which presumes power to be binary, either shting from Westminster to Holyrood or vice versa, either a strong Scotland or a strong Britain, and instead enhance the role of both parliaments and governments through a structure built to last for decades, rather than one built to last until the next time the SNP does well at an election.When you ask two unionists how to defeat nationalism you get five dferent answers.

In any case, the really unhealthy thing about China, and the one that should alarm the West, is in the body politic.The recent actions of its government, which include the new national security law in Hong Kong, its illegal incursion and military engagement in the Galwan river valley in India, and its systematic rounding up of Uighur Muslims, more than a million of whom have been put in concentration camps in what the UN says amounts to genocide, ought to be a reminder that the despotic Communist regime remains wedded to the principle outlined by Mao Tse-Tung, that ldquopolitical power grows out of the barrel of a gun.In the case of Hong Kong, you could hardly get a more obvious example of the regimersquos authoritarian instincts ndash as well as a blithe disregard for the legal undertakings it gave before the handover, which promised that there would be no change in the law for at least  years, and that the territoryrsquos special status would be maintained. Instead, the new law essentially makes it a criminal offence to argue for democracy, and makes a free press impossible. Already, there has been the removal from libraries of books on liberty.It is greatly to the discredit of Western democracies that, for the past  years or so, there has been little attempt to draw attention to, let alone challenge, this repulsive dictatorship. We donrsquot seem even to be able to resist the imposition of a mobile phone network that may well be compromised by the Chinese security services, which have a stellar track record of spying on their own population and restricting their access to information.Itrsquos not just that, since the Tiananmen Square massacre of , in which thousands died, wersquove largely ignored the oppression of the Chinese people by their government after all, despite a few token protests when their president tips up, wersquove ignored the plight of illegally occupied Tibet for almost seven decades, and Taiwan, which practically no Western nationofficially recognises, and which we wonrsquot even admit to the UN in case Beijing gets huffy.Itrsquos that we appear to have convinced ourselves that, because China has embraced aspects of capitalism and become much more affluent in recent decades, that we can just forget about the fact that itrsquos still a dictatorship as tyrannical as that other Peoplersquos Republic in North Korea, which is the countryrsquos only official ally.That may have something to do with the fact that prosperity and freedom seem to be related with very few exceptionsliberty, along with property rights and the rule of law, seems to be a requirement for a sustained and successful economy. Command economies, even when they have enormous natural advantages, as Venezuela and Zimbabwe did, tend to go bust after enslaving and immiserising their citizens.And China, despite the skyscrapers of Shanghai and the worldrsquos largest number of billionaires, is not quite the economic success it might appear it may have embraced commerce ndash it is the worldrsquos largest exporter and second-largest importer ndash but not free trade. Its financial gains are slightly less stellar than its position as the worldrsquos second-largest economy by nominal GDP and the speed of its growthmight suggest, and it is certainly not evenly distributed. The middle class may now number around  million, but the country has . billion citizens, and an awful lot of debt.In per capita output, China is still a middle-income nation, ranked somewhere between th and nd , depending on how you measure it, behind such powerhouses as Gabon, Suriname and the Dominican Republic. By contrast, Macau, Hong Kong and Singapore are all in the top  by almost every estimation.In the past two decades, according to the Heritage Foundation, China has added about  trillion to its GDP, which sounds impressive. But in the same time, the United States added about  trillion to its, with a population less than one-fth the size, and with much lower levels of growth.None of this, naturally, alters the fact that, quite apart from being one of the worldrsquos oldest and greatest cultures, China is the worldrsquos most populous country, third or fourth biggest, one of its most signicant military powers and probably the only place that really rivals the US. These are all reasons why no one, and particularly not the UK, is going to start kicking the Chinese around.But it does provide some cause to question the orthodox opinion that it is about to overtake America as a superpower, that the two are in some form of new Cold War, or that it ndash as opposed to, say, India ndash is bound to dominate the next century.

With restrictions in place for large events due to Covid-, the festival has transformed into a virtual event, which is hoped will bring it to an even wider audience.Foraging Fortnight is being run in partnership with Orkney International Science Festival, as part of its rich programme of talks, outings and activities. The events encourage adherence to Scotlandrsquos Outdoor Access Code and organisers have put together foraging guidelines to ensure that those taking part are doing so in a safe and responsible way.Foraged ingredients have become a familiar addition to some restaurant menus including at Wedgwood in Edinburgh, run by renowned chef Paul Wedgwood.

restrictions on travel, and the socially distanced and virtual ways of working for the foreseeable future may have catastrophic funding implications.Our universities are world-renowned, and attract students from around the globe to come to live and study in Scotland.This has been a great strength, and the international student tuition fee income has become vital to enable universities to deliver the teaching, knowledge exchange and research they do so successfully, particularly when teaching budgets have been underfunded for some time.The pandemic and the emergency measures required bring so much uncertainty as to whether new students from Scotland, the rest of the UK, and the wider world, will turn up in September for the new academic year.These studentsrsquo decisions have financial implications for institutions, as to whether those who pay tuition fees will be bringing that income to universities this year.Forecasts y, with estimates ranging between a pound million loss of income for the sector at the lower end, to the Scottish Funding Councilrsquos worst-case scenario estimate of an operating deficit of poundm in  . Whatever the reality, our universities need help to get through the coming period, not least because they are the drivers of economic growth, andso many are vital employers and stakeholders in their local economies.UCUrsquos research carried out at the start of the crisis by London Economics estimated a  per cent decrease inthe number of international students coming to Scotland, meaningjust under , fewer first-year international student enrolmentsin the coming academic year. The London Economics report estimates that this, along with the other effects of the current crisis, will lead to apoundm financial hole in the sector for the year  .We know universities are already taking steps to make cuts. This includes not renewing the army of fixed term and hourly paid staff who deliver vital teaching and tutoring to undergraduates. Staff are being asked to endure pay and increment freezes, as well as other reductions to their terms and conditions.A number of universities are also contemplating signicant job losses. UCU will always look to protect jobs and vigorously oppose compulsory redundancies. :Scottish universities at risk of being wiped out by Covid- crisis , experts warnThe perilous financial situation is why we launched our Fund The Future campaign calling on government to support universities through this dficult time.But this is more than simply a trade union looking to protect its membersrsquo jobs. Universities are not seeking special treatment or additional funding simply for the sake of it. Rather we need to protect the sector because universities have an essential role in driving the country out of crisis.First, and probably of most importance at the present, is the specic role of higher education in fighting the virus, providing labs for research and testing, finding possible cures and treatment for those infected and developing vaccines, protective equipment, and other public health strategies. Similarly, it is many of our universities that are educating the nursing staff, health care professionals, doctors and consultants who work in the NHS day in and day out. The inspirational reports of nurses and doctors leaving their studies earlyto join the fight against Covid-and save lives is testament both to their personal dedication, but alsoto the staff in our universities who have equipped them for the job they now do.Equally important is the role that universities play in their communities. Universities are major employers in their town or city and offer decent, skilled employment that bringspeople to live and contribute to local economies.University research, and the critical thinking graduates they produce, helps us to understand the world in which we live. At a time where fake news, misinformation and polarisation is re, we should be valuing the role of universities to inform, educate and empower.The final element of why government help is required is that higher education is a key driver of economic recovery as the country comes out of the current crisis. From nurturing entrepreneurial skills, spin-off companies and SMEs, research and development, and a supply of highly skilled graduates entering the jobs market, universities are a key player in building the economy back from the coronavirus recession. Simply put, there is no road to recovery that does not involve a well-resourced higher education sector.We welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos poundmillion of new money for research in universities along with its commitment to maintaining free tuition.Research carried out among Scottish domiciled university applicants for UCU has shown that their attitudes towards deferral, and in some cases, going into higher education at all, is substantially dependant on not having to pay tuition fees.The UK Governmentrsquos support to the sector thus far has been to bring forward money for research, offer loans and suggest it will bail out institutions on the brink of failure. This response is underwhelming and fails to acknowledge the key role higher education plays in our economy and society.The shortfallin teaching funding in universities in Scotland has not yet been addressed, and will be exacerbated by any loss of international student fee income.  We need a support package from both Scottish and UK governments that properly underwrite the sector and secures the future for our institutions and the staff and students who make them world class.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

She is currently volunteering with Skye Community Response and helping to fundraise for the Centre of Resilience in Bihar in India, among other projects.Layla worked with the directors of the Centre of Resilience # Kumar Prashant and Benjamin Reid-Howells # last summer and spent three months in India last winter.During that time she visited the centre which is in the fourth poorest state in India, Bihar.Bihar was historically the educational epicentre of India, however, it suffers from floods and droughts, cases of extreme poverty, and wide-spread disease # but people, like Kumar Prashant, are working tirelessly to elevate this state out of poverty.Kumar Prashant travelled with his friend Ben from India to Scotland by motorcycle helping multiple humanitarian initiatives along the way.

this time to do battle in the Glamaig Stableford competition.Only two played in the competition won by Sandi Beatson # that#s three-in-a-row for her.The boys to come out to play and play they most certainly did in earnest competition for the RNLI Shield.There was a very good turnout on the Saturday of this weekend competition with the weather conditions certainly predicted to favour that particular day#s cohort.Covid  restrictions meant that instead of the normal random #draw# for partners players arranged their own #friendship groups# and appropriate tee times on the required booking sheet.Battle commenced # and what a scrap it turned out to be.Five players reduced their handicaps but there could only be one winner, and that was Robert Macaskill.Off the first tee at am his golf was very steady with  bfs required to navigate the outward nine but a miserly  hits required to conclude his great round.His #touch# round the greens was apparently sensitive in the extreme with a chip-in for par on , #up and down# from Billy the Bunker on , a chip-in birdie on  and several other good chances.All in all just a very good, tidy performance. points then for loop one and  points for loop two and that strong finish was to be the decisive factor as his margin of victory was only decided by virtue of the #better inward half# in a photo-finish with good friend and Vice-Captain Ally Young who was to submit his tremendous score in very inclement playing conditions some  hours later!Ally#s two nines, off his  handicap were  and  with a birdie thrown into each loop for good measure and a stableford points conversion for his halves of  and  points respectively.Incidentally, the putter must have been behaving because it holed a  foot putt on the fourth hole and a  footer on the th for #birds#.NB it was the tool and not the workman.Ally also had the consolation of reducing his handicap by two shots # the biggest reduction among the prizewinners # because of the status of his exact handicap which, like all players is calculated to the decimal point.We had enough jargon last week so we#ll let that slip by unnoticed shall we No question his was the better performance in the respective conditions but it#s Robert who will receive the trophy-and quite properly regain the bragging rights in the house of Macaskill.Two points behind the leaders a trio of players each ed very respectable totals of points.Andrew Long made contact with the ball  times on his outward half with the highlight being a good birdie on the dficult th hole and required but  strokes coming home with a remarkable run of ten straight pars from holes  to .John Maclean played steadily, albeit with early drama in his round # a nasty triple-bogey seven on the second hole.Chapfallen  No chance as composure regained he recorded  for his first lap of the circuit followed by  blows next time round.Ross Cumming#s two nines were  and  off his #mark# so in the company of his #old fella# that day he showed who was #the man#.Ross too suffered an early dig in the ribs with a triple bogey on the second hole but also did well to recover and tickle a touch off the handicap on completion of his round.No midweek competition for the gents this time round but the ‘Trouts’ came out to play in a pop-up Seniors Mixed Stableford competition later that week.With outdoor catering billed as an #attraction# for the silver sharpshooters the beau monde of the area swarmed like locusts to the feast.The format for the day was successful as almost  of the area#s finest ladies and gentlemen golfers paraded their skills on a course displaying promising signs of extremely rude health # apart from the reepach humple on the second fairway # and it was to be an overseas raider who was tohome victorious.Ally #Doc# Mackenzie, now domiciled in Plockton was to be #the man# with an extremely comfortable victory following a rich harvest of points in the forgiving Stableford format.His winning total of  points was four clear of Chris Mackinnon in second place.Alaisdair # a #friend# said his father couldn#t spell # rather limped out in  strokes but a fine  off his  mark coming home garnered a whopping  points to add to the earlier  and his unassailable total.Nothing much of interest in the  but an evil nine and an excellent wee two showed the extremes to which our man travelled on his homeward journey.Rumour has it that #our hero# offered to buy free drinks for everyone # in the sure and certain knowledge that with the lockdown still to be relaxed his money was safe!I also have it on good authority that his often misunderstood droll countenance momentarily offered a fleeting smile of satisfaction in victory before swtly and almost immediately reverting to type.Chris Mackinnon started brightly with only three dozen shots required to pilot his ball round the opening nine holes but  coming home with an horrendous triple bogey  on the final hole may have left a wee bit of a bitter taste in the mouth afterwards.Third place went to Dave Webster who ed a very impressive total of  points off his  handicap mark but a few more performances like that and he could be back playing with the big boys again.The size of the field offers a wee bit more scope for reflection and Donalda Johnston found form and Peter Mackenzie, kin to the winner smoothed in one further point behind Dave Webster.Honourable mention too for George Neill who might have #thought he was Archie# having recorded two birdies in his opening seven holes but sadly thereafter the ba# burst.And finally to the mystery of the #Captain#s eagle#.It#s been dficult trying to untangle the whole story occurring as it did in an unofficial, non-counting charity game but a source, when catechised offered the following description -#a Phil Mickelson-type shot landed like a dislodged swan#s feather on the green with precisely the correct velocity to carry it to the hole with not a millimetre to spare#!What preceded the shot that elicited that magniloquent delineation is still to be ascertained. .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Just some of the hair mishaps stylists will have to tackle after over  days of closure. On Monday, normally a day of rest for the hair and beauty industry, the latest easing of restrictions meant demand for a post-lockdown top-to-toe transformation was sky high. And judging by the volume of phone calls and messages from clients scrambling to get an appointment, salons are set for a busy few weeks.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBen Magowan has his hair cut at Shankeys on Belfast’s Lisburn RoadStephen Hamilton FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBen Magowan has his hair cut at Shankeys on Belfast’s Lisburn RoadAs well as hairdressers and barbers, beauty salons and tattoo parlours were also back in business. Belfast#s Lisburn Road was a hive of activity as men seeking urgent restyles queued up outside the numerous barber shops dotted across both sides of the thoroughfare. Despite cups of coffee and glossy magazines being out, and facemasks, hand sanitiser and Perspex screens in, salons have been booked out weeks in advance.At Andrew Watson Hairdressing, Una Calvert from east Belfast was sitting comfortably in front of the mirror for her first cut and colour since January. You have no idea how long I#ve waited for this day. I have been tempted to put all sorts of things in my hair but I#ve stayed away from home dye, she said. Apart from trimming my fringe, I leave it all to the experts. Once I heard when salons could reopen I was straight on the phone to Andrew and I#m so delighted to be here on the first day back.As a long-time client Una said she had absolutely no qualms about coming back in. Andrew is an excellent hairdresser and always reliable, so I had every confidence that everything would be in place.At this stage I just want to leave with a nice hairstyle. PPE-clad Andrew was equally excited to be back despite facing the prospect of an -hour working week to tackle the backlog.At first it felt like the first day at school with some nervousness but soon it was as though we#d never been away, he laughed.

For the past few weeks salons theand breadth of Northern Ireland from Belcoo to Bangor, Strabane to Strangford have been working flat out to redecorate their premises and install protective measures in the lead-up to July .After hotels and pubs serving food reopened on Friday, the hair and beauty industry had to wait three more days to get back to business. Among those who wasted no time in welcoming clients was Sean Lawlor, who threw open the doors of the Cambridge Barbershop on the Lisburn Road at a minute after midnight.While most appointments had been made well in advance, word soon spread and many others were arriving throughout the day as walk-ins.I wanted in as soon as possible and July , once it came about, we were open, Sean said.There were one or two regulars in and I didn#t recognise them with the long hair and beards, but once the transformation came about then I knew who it was.I think we are going to remain busy for the next few weeks.The staff are all wearing PPE and visors, the chairs are separated to just below two metres apart, so we#re well within the regulations, he added.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJoe Carberry pictured before his haircut at Cambridge Barbers on the Lisburn Road.

He said: I#ve been trying to keep it trimmed myself over the past few months but it#s never quite the same. I know some people have made an absolute mess of trying to do their own hair so given that this is day one I was expecting massive queues, but thankfully it#s not too bad.Emerging from the barbers after his trim, Andrew said: My hair feels about a kilogram lighter.

But they stressed that social media accounts, founded under Noah’s name seeking further information about his disappearance and death, did not have their permission.

Six days later, his body was discovered in a storm drain close to where he went missing.While police say they have no reason to suspect foul play in the -year-old St Malachy’s College pupil’s death, speculation has continued on social media.The family, including mum Fiona, said: “We recognise the huge public concern of the entire population and we thank each and every one of you. So many people have been incredibly generous to us with practical support.Read More In his own words: A letter to Noah Donohoe from dad Emmanuel“This support includes providing pieces of information regarding Noah’s disappearance and death. Separately, some have also ventilated concerns on social media s.“At this time, we are working with the PSNI on matters which are outstanding to the investigation and we are seeking answers to questions which arise. Noah’s disappearance and death undoubtedly raise questions however public speculation and theory is unhelpful. We are dealing with the facts. We have seen a number of social media accounts which have been founded under Noah’s name seeking further information. These accounts do not have the family’s permission.“Rather than ventilating any issue on social media s, we urge anyone with information regarding Noah’s disappearance and death to forward this information, including any photographic CCTV footage to the PSNI or to Relatives for Justice  email: info@relativesforjustice .“All information will be dealt with in strictest confidence.”The family said they were are also represented by solicitor Niall Murphy of KRW Law.

The BBC has reported the Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture  Traditioncould submit the report within the next fornight.Set up via the Fresh Start Agreement, the FICT#s aim was to address contentious issues surrounding flags, emblems and identity.While the group#s initial report was expected in December , this was delayed by the collapse of the Executive in January of that year. Read More  bands apply to parade over Twelfth in wake of rowThe FICT began meeting again in January  and had been tasked with submitting the report by April, but this was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.It#s report is expected to be around  pages and feature a series of recommendations around some of the most contentious issues in Northern Ireland. It#s not known when the recommendations will be revealed to the public. Leaks last year suggested the FICT report#s proposals would include the prohibition of certain materials including flags on bonfires and that Sinn Fein had demanded the tricolour must be flown with the Union flag on public buildings or no flags should be flown at all.Loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson claimed that the commission was planning to introduce new legislation surrounding bonfires which would require an application process.The BBC reported last year that the FICT has cost more than £, since it was set up in June .More than half of that money has been spent on expenses and remuneration for its  members, excluding elected representatives. The FICT is co-chaired by community worker Neville Armstrong and Queen#s University academic Professor Dominic Bryan and includes members nominated by political parties and others including academics, Orange Order representatives and business leaders.Other members include UUP MLA Doug Beattie former DUP MLAs Nelson McCausland and Ian McCrea and Belfast SDLP councillor Carl Whyte.Belfast Most ReadConvicted fraudster dies after choking on piece of food at NI restaurantCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor weddings to resume from July  Tyrone GAA star Peter Loughran charged in multi-million drugs probeNoah Donohoe dad: The son I never metBrothers in arms: Pallbearers Lynch, Murray and #The Surgeon# turn Storey#s send-off into show of strength,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mollys family say they do not want her death to have been in vain, and have urged her friends and other young people to speak to others about problems they are experiencing.

They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said.

In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On  May, George Floyd - a black man – was surrounded by four white men in police unorms, all with guns. Three of them stood by while one literally squeezed the le out of him – all the time knowing they were being filmed. We watched this video – like many others globally - and imagined it was our son, our husband, our brother, our friend. It was traumatic. The familiarity and the horror of these images demanded that we raise our voices and demonstrate our anger and pain. But that is the US you might think - it is not like that here. There are not so many black people in Northern Ireland, so it is less visible but systemic racism is pervasive. The qualications of many black nurses working in the NHS are not recognised for further post-graduate study. This is discriminatory and obstructs career development and promotion. While around % of nurses and % of doctors in the NHS are from ethnic minorities, none are senior managers. googletag.cmd.push The fact that we don’t actually know how many black people there are in NI is a symptom of this institutional blindness. We are so unimportant we aren’t even counted. We have been calling for ethnic monitoring for years as part of the Racial Equality Strategy but are yet to see concrete action. On  June, we peacefully protested – to show solidarity with George Floyd but also to raise awareness about racism here. Unlike other large public gatherings during the pandemic, all participants wore masks. Hand sanitizer was available and social distancing was enforced. The messaging about the events stressed public health. googletag.cmd.push But when we arrived at the Guildhall what happened to us  We were intimidated. There were armoured vehicles everywhere. I was surrounded by three white men, all in police unorms, all with guns. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the police are routinely armed. It is also the only part of the UK where organizers and participants in BLM rallies have been prosecuted and fined. We are hurt and disappointed that the PSNI cannot see this. They seem to be sorry that we are upset but incapable of understanding why we’re upset. In their statement on the protest they describe George Floyd’s death as “avoidable and unnecessary”. It was intentional murder. One week after our events, another protest to “protect statues” was organized in Belfast. There were no fines and no prosecutions. When we have challenged the PSNI and the Justice Minister on this blatant double standard we have received confused, contradictory, and inaccurate information. Last week there was another prominent large public gathering. The PSNI have said they are reviewing evidence. The policing style at both these events was markedly dferent – we will raise this with the Equality Commission for possible breach of our human rights. What made our events distinct  There are no elected black politicians in Northern Ireland. Our community is not represented in power sharing institutions. The PSNI demonstrated that they can show understanding of context and nuance when policing majority groups amid this pandemic. Yet the one visible event organized by black people was criminalized from the outset – with additional enforcement powers added to the Coronavirus Regulations rushed into force at pm on  June.  The PSNI have said they support our aims – but do they  The protests were about police violence and impunity. Have they thought about the way black people have historically been criminalized how they are disproportionately stopped and searched why young black men are perceived as dangerous and young women sexually harassed  We have made three demands to the PSNI: - Rescind the fines - Drop the prosecutions - Issue a public apology The PSNI tell us there is nothing they can do. They are hiding behind process arguing that while there is a review by the Police Ombudsman their hands are tied. They want to move forward but after the way we were treated on  June there is no trust. Cressida Dick of the politan police did not hesitate to apologise for the behaviour of her officers who shared selfies of two murdered black women – “ it is as it appears to be” – even though there is an ongoing investigation. She apologized because she knew it was wrong and how damaging such behaviour by police officers is to public trust and community safety. We truly want to work with the police – it is vital we can feel safe, protected, and equal before the law. But we need actions not words. We need the PSNI to demonstrate they can treat us with the same sensitivity and understanding they treat majority communities.

On  May, George Floyd - a black man – was surrounded by four white men in police unorms, all with guns. Three of them stood by while one literally squeezed the le out of him – all the time knowing they were being filmed. We watched this video – like many others globally - and imagined it was our son, our husband, our brother, our friend. It was traumatic. The familiarity and the horror of these images demanded that we raise our voices and demonstrate our anger and pain. But that is the US you might think - it is not like that here. There are not so many black people in Northern Ireland, so it is less visible but systemic racism is pervasive. The qualications of many black nurses working in the NHS are not recognised for further post-graduate study. This is discriminatory and obstructs career development and promotion. While around % of nurses and % of doctors in the NHS are from ethnic minorities, none are senior managers. googletag.cmd.push The fact that we don’t actually know how many black people there are in NI is a symptom of this institutional blindness. We are so unimportant we aren’t even counted. We have been calling for ethnic monitoring for years as part of the Racial Equality Strategy but are yet to see concrete action. On  June, we peacefully protested – to show solidarity with George Floyd but also to raise awareness about racism here. Unlike other large public gatherings during the pandemic, all participants wore masks. Hand sanitizer was available and social distancing was enforced. The messaging about the events stressed public health. googletag.cmd.push But when we arrived at the Guildhall what happened to us  We were intimidated. There were armoured vehicles everywhere. I was surrounded by three white men, all in police unorms, all with guns. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the police are routinely armed. It is also the only part of the UK where organizers and participants in BLM rallies have been prosecuted and fined. We are hurt and disappointed that the PSNI cannot see this. They seem to be sorry that we are upset but incapable of understanding why we’re upset. In their statement on the protest they describe George Floyd’s death as “avoidable and unnecessary”. It was intentional murder. One week after our events, another protest to “protect statues” was organized in Belfast. There were no fines and no prosecutions. When we have challenged the PSNI and the Justice Minister on this blatant double standard we have received confused, contradictory, and inaccurate information. Last week there was another prominent large public gathering. The PSNI have said they are reviewing evidence. The policing style at both these events was markedly dferent – we will raise this with the Equality Commission for possible breach of our human rights. What made our events distinct  There are no elected black politicians in Northern Ireland. Our community is not represented in power sharing institutions. The PSNI demonstrated that they can show understanding of context and nuance when policing majority groups amid this pandemic. Yet the one visible event organized by black people was criminalized from the outset – with additional enforcement powers added to the Coronavirus Regulations rushed into force at pm on  June.  The PSNI have said they support our aims – but do they  The protests were about police violence and impunity. Have they thought about the way black people have historically been criminalized how they are disproportionately stopped and searched why young black men are perceived as dangerous and young women sexually harassed  We have made three demands to the PSNI: - Rescind the fines - Drop the prosecutions - Issue a public apology The PSNI tell us there is nothing they can do. They are hiding behind process arguing that while there is a review by the Police Ombudsman their hands are tied. They want to move forward but after the way we were treated on  June there is no trust. Cressida Dick of the politan police did not hesitate to apologise for the behaviour of her officers who shared selfies of two murdered black women – “ it is as it appears to be” – even though there is an ongoing investigation. She apologized because she knew it was wrong and how damaging such behaviour by police officers is to public trust and community safety. We truly want to work with the police – it is vital we can feel safe, protected, and equal before the law. But we need actions not words. We need the PSNI to demonstrate they can treat us with the same sensitivity and understanding they treat majority communities.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

Speaking at Mass today at St Eugenes Cathedral, the Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, said there was still confusion in relation to some religious services. “This last week, I have been trying to work out whether the NI Executive has now given us permission to baptise,” said Bishop McKeown. “I know that it sounds ridiculous that Churches have to get political clearance to baptise a baby or an adult! googletag.cmd.push “Of course, I can understand the thinking behind the earlier temporary baptism ban because, for some, sacramental events seem to refer to the large parties afterwards. “Now we can have the baptism parties – but I am unclear whether we can actually have the baptism before the party!” Bishop McKeown said he was not sure whether the legal restrictions have changed or whether people still waiting for further clarication. “When politicians accuse others of not understanding government messages, that might suggest a lack of clarity in the messaging rather than merely culpable deafness on the part of the listeners,” he added. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.

It was revealed recently that just over % of all vehicles using the Pennyburn dump in Derry are from the Republic. Concern had been raised that local ratepayers were footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. Five of the councils  recycling centres reopened on May  last after being closed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. After the recycling centres reopened, council officers noted the registration of all vehicles using them. googletag.cmd.push The information was collated from Monday, May , to Friday, May . The figures revealed that during that -day period, a total of , cars with Republic of Ireland number plates used the local dumps. The vast majority of Republic-registered vehicles used the Pennyburn recycling centre - a total of . This was just over % of the overall , vehicles which used the Pennyburn dump during this time. Eighty three vehicles with southern number plates used the Glendermott recycling centre during this period, out of a total of , visitors.

Derry’s recycling centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal, people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free. The issue of usage of the local recycling centres was discussed yesterday at a special meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration committee. At the meeting, DUP Alderman Ryan McCready proposed that a working group be set up to look at the issue of vehicles from the Republic using the local recycling centres. This was backed by all other parties on the council apart from Sinn Fein. In a report prepared for yesterdays meeting, it was stated that additional staff would be neededthe council was to monitor vehicles using the recycling centres. The report stated: More recently Members asked that officers consider the implications of a policy that restricts access to recycling sites to those that reside within the Council area only. This would place an additional resource burden on the service in that staff will have to check the residency details of all those entering sites right across the district. Several of the sites operate with a single member of staff, who needs to supervise the disposal of materials and assist those using the site, therefore additional staff would be required at these facilities to ensure compliance.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020

resumption of church services after they were suspended  weeks ago due to the Covid- pandemic.Services resumed on Monday after the Northern Ireland Executive announced that public worship could restart.While the parish priest of Castlewellan and Kilcoo, Fr Denis McKinley, was happy to be finally able to celebrate Mass again with his parishioners he said he remained apprehensive over some peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with.

While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb. Now that would be really rewarding..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"October next National League date for Down  ","story":"IT has been over  weeks now since Down last played a league game mdash against Offaly on March .The next league game is due to take place against Leitrim on Saturday, October , or the following day,the Covid- virus continues to fizzle out.

She was so successful that while still in her twenties, she was being hailedas the richest woman in the Klondike. Others called her The Queen of the Klondike.`The men who moil for gold.Miners Working a Chute on Bonanza Creek.It was a fortune that began with three travelling trunks packed with…hot water bottles! But we’re getting ahead of the story. Toronto travel writer Mitchell Smyth, who grew up in Ballycastle, has visited the Klondike several times, where he first learned of the Mulrooney story. The story begins, he says, in  when Bridget Mulrooneywas born in Carns, a rural townland about  miles north of Sligo town. Her parents emigrated to the United States soon afterwards and Bridget was brought up by a grandmother. In her teens, she joined her parents in the coal mining country around Scranton, Pennsylvania, but le was too dull there forthe Sligo-girl. She took off for Chicago, where she ran a sandwich stand at the Chicago Exposition of . She was worth several thousand dollars at the age of ! Next we find her on the steamer City of Topeka, which ran between San Francisco and the Alaskan Panhandle, where she added to her small fortune by bootlegging liquor. The ship had no bar so Belindamade herself a long fur coat with a canvas lining. In the lining were pouches for  half-pint bottles, which she sold, at a handsome mark-up, to thirsty passengers.Gold was discovered in the Klondike in  and Belinda joined the rush, over the treacherous Chilcoot Pass from Skagway, Alaska, by foot, then down the Yukon River by raft to Dawson City, the centre of the action. But she didn’t travel light. Looking ahead, she decided miners would pay a lot for a bit of warmth in the tent-towns of the ‘diggings’ so, assisted by two Indian guides, she carted three huge cases of hot-water bottles into Dawson, and sold them at a  per cent mark-up. Her fortune was growing. Before long she owned a roadhouse where she entertained the likes of Jack London, the future author of gold rush novels. It is said that London modelled Buck, the dog ‘hero’ in his book The Call of the Wild, on Belinda Mulrooney’s pet dog. A new film based on the book, starring Harrison Ford, has recently come out.She worked the bar herself, listening to the gossip and shrewdly making notes for future action on new claims. Within a year she had stock in a dozen mines and the money was flowing in. She built the Fairview Hotel, the best hostelry in Dawson, where miners paid big money to eat off linen tablecloths, drink tea from bone china and be serenaded by an orchestra. By , at the age of , she was being hailed as The Queen of the Klondike. Then Cupid’s arrow struck this‘short, dark, angular, masculine…hard-boiled’ woman. Her suitor was one Charles Eugene Carbonneau, who introduced himself as a French count seeking investments in mines for an Anglo-French syndicate. Belinda was so much in love that she wouldn’t listen to a French-Canadian foreman from the Bonanza mine, who positively identied ‘the count’ as a barber from Montreal’s Rue St. Denis. They married in . Belinda was . The ‘count’ and ‘countess’ honeymooned in Paris, where“they rode up and down the Champs-Elysses…with an Egyptian footman who unrolled a carpet of brilliant crimson whenever they stepped out.They orced in , after Belinda discovered that ‘the count’ was fleecing her. He died in . But she still had plenty of money left which she put it into real estate as the gold rush ebbed. In  she moved to Washington state, where she lived comfortably until her death in , aged , with her memories of a very full le.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

careful steps to restart our economy.On Monday, a series of changes will be made to the coronavirus regulations ndash the main change will be to enable non-essential retail businesses to open.They follow the fourth statutory review of the coronavirus regulations by Welsh ministers, using the latest scientic and medical evidence from the UK Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , the Welsh

period to begin to make preparations for reopening.At the next review on Thursday, July , the Welsh Government will consider a range of specic options for opening.These include self-contained holiday accommodation and personal care services, such as hairdressing and beauty, by appointment.Discussions will also be held with the hospitality sector about the potential phased reopening of pubs, cafes,

therefore signalling owners of self-contained accommodation should use the next three weeks to prepare to re-open, working with their local communities.ldquoBut I want people to know coronavirus has not gone away.ldquoWe have some headroom to make this package of changes to the regulations, which will be introduced in a phased and cautious way in Wales.ldquoMany aspects of daily le in Wales will be moving into the amber zone in our traffic light system.ldquo But we all need to continue to take steps to protect ourselves from the virus ndash that means working from home wherever possible avoiding unnecessary travel only meeting with one other household outdoors maintaining social distancing and washing your hands often.ldquoIt may also mean wearing a face covering in some

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbdaacbcdfaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccefdcbadcfab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
