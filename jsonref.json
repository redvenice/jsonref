But that doesn’t mean we can let our guard downIt’s hard to believe, but Covid-19 has been with us for more than a year, and like the rest of us, it is beginning to adapt. It isn’t unique in this regard – we know that viruses mutate all the time as they make mistakes during replication. Once a virus has entered a human host, it needs to find the right cell type in which it can replicate. During this process, it is exposed to human immune responses that exert pressure on it in various ways, causing mutations to develop. This often occurs in parts of the virus that are most exposed to the immune system, such as the outer protein. In the case of Covid-19, this is the spike protein that binds it to host cells, allowing the virus to enter and replicate.The UK variant initially appeared last autumn in Kent with a mutation in the spike protein, along with a couple of amino acid deletions. This appeared to be more transmissible, but not any more clinically severe, and was later found not to impact significantly on the effectiveness of our then main PfizerBioNTech vaccine. Shortly after, we heard about the emergence of a new variant that contained a different pattern of mutations in the spike protein, which appeared to be spreading quickly throughout the South African population.The more worrying thing about the South African variant is that it has been shown to significantly reduce the neutralising efficacy of spike protein-specific antibodies, such as those induced by the current generation of vaccines, including those developed by PfizerBioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Novavax. It has also been shown to hinder the effectiveness of antibodies contained in plasma obtained from people who were previously infected with the older, Wuhan strain of the virus.In addition, the recent E484K mutation in the UK variant is worrying as this particular mutation seems to be the main one that is responsible for the vaccine-escape properties. This mutation is already present in both the Brazilian and South African variants.Given the increased transmissibility of the UK and South African variants and the E484K mutation, how worried should we be? Perhaps not so much. Don’t forget that exposure to any of these variants will produce a natural response from your immune system against all the viral proteins, not just to the spike protein targeted by most of the Covid-19 vaccines. If the virus has some mutations in the spike protein that may reduce vaccine effectiveness, your natural immune response will also act against all the other viral proteins to defend you further against these variant viruses. Even a partially protective vaccine, together with your natural immune response, may reduce the risk of more severe Covid-19 that requires hospitalisation.This does not mean that we should be complacent. To reduce the emergence of viral variants we need to reduce the viral replication in the population overall. Viruses can only mutate if they are allowed to replicate, so with large numbers of people being infected in the UK, the virus has a greater chance to mutate and evolve into these more transmissible, vaccine-escaping variants. This means that we need to continue with the current masking, social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions to slow down the spread of the viruses, while continuing the mass Covid-19 vaccination programme.To some extent, the appearance of these variants is inevitable, especially in the first few years of a new, emerging virus as it spreads to infect a host population. After many years living with this Covid-19 virus across the whole population, we will have built up years of immunological experience and protection, so that any clinical disease is likely to be milder – as we see with the seasonal common cold coronaviruses and, to some extent, seasonal influenza. This may mean vaccine boosters each year, as for flu, as well as some ongoing social-distancing measures, such as masks on public transport and indoor public spaces, well into the future. For a while at least, we will need to learn to live with the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ade276e5a31a0d1ee48a448aa761417eb6d27e4/0_248_7360_4415/master/7360.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=25e4942b60e36b6ea2c1b2032dbbe071","title":"liverpool v brighton premier league live","story":"Liverpool had one shot on target as Brighton bent the match to their will at Anfield and emerged with a deserved victoryFantastic result, fantastic performance. It had everything. Real courage when we had the ball, when we didn’t have the ball, defended with our lives as a team and limited a good team to not too many chances. And at the same time I felt we had a few ourselves. You have to come here and be disciplined and I thought we were. The players worked so hard, ran for each other, reacted well when we made mistakes or the opponent was on top. I can’t speak highly enough of the character of the performance, it was sensational. We’re just trying our best in this league every game, every day we face a huge task. It’s one for the supporters, for everyone involved in the club, because it’s not often a club like us come here and win. We’ve been on a good run. I think that’s four clean sheets in a row. But we’ve got another game on Saturday, this league is incredibly punishing, so we have to go again.Jesse Lingard rewarded David Moyes’s faith in rescuing him from his Manchester United doldrums with a goalscoring contribution to the win that means West Ham have achieved their highest top-flight points tally after 22 games since 1985-86.The former England winger, having signed on loan on Monday, provided signs of the spark that marked out his early-career promise before scoring West Ham’s second goal at the start of the second half and, after Ollie Watkins had pulled one back nine minutes from time, the clinching third.Much more here:Brighton are 15th tonight, 10 points clear of Fulham in 18th. But they’ve been desperately unlucky at times this season, could easily have another half-dozen points and be floating merrily in mid-table, and surely won’t be bothered by genuine relegation concern this season.“Outplayed to be honest,” writes Rory Kenneally. “Disappointing. Hopefully the new signings mean our midfield can get back to being midfielders and us back to our best but it looks like retaining the title is no longer on the cards.” It does look very much like that: Liverpool are seven points behind Manchester City, who have a game in hand, and victory at Anfield on Sunday is surely essential, but this side don’t have the look of champions.Andy Hunter has already filed his match report from Anfield:The need to defeat Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday has become more pressing for Liverpool. Just when it seemed the Premier League champions had reinvigorated their title defence with successive away wins at Tottenham and West Ham, they succumbed to a second consecutive home defeat as Brighton executed a perfect gameplan to record their first league victory at Anfield since 1982.Steven Alzate, with a huge slice of fortune, delivered a memorable win for Graham Potter’s side who defended superbly all night and possessed the quality to trouble Liverpool on the few occasions they broke forward. Creatively and clinically, Jürgen Klopp’s team were found wanting again and find themselves seven points behind the league leaders ahead of Sunday’s encounter.Much more here:It is apparently the first time in the history of the Premier League that five or more games have all been won by the away team.There were five Premier League games today, and five away wins.90+5 mins: It’s all over! Brighton were defensive, sure, but they bossed that game and thoroughly deserved to win it.90+3 mins: Liverpool win a corner. Kelleher doesn’t come up, disappointingly, and Sanchez comes decisively to claim Alexander-Arnold’s cross.90+1 mins: There will be four minutes of stoppage time. Liverpool look as far away from scoring as ever. Brighton flick a long ball forward to Connolly, who has a player unmarked behind him, screaming wildly and repeatedly for the ball, but ignores him and heads to the touchline instead.89 mins: At the other end Bissouma sends in a 30-yarder that swerves and dips, but still clears the bar by 10 yards or so.89 mins: Liverpool find Robertson in the penalty area, and his first touch would have opened up a shooting chance had Origi, on a rare foray into the penalty area, not got in the way.87 mins: Liverpool look a side in need of a plan B. Salah and Alexander-Arnold are still manoeuvring space on the right, Robertson is the one other player regularly contributing to attacks (indeed, he just got on the end of a Salah cross), Origi doesn’t seem any keener on penalty areas than Firmino was.85 mins: GOAL! West Ham seal the points at Villa Park, and it’s a second for Lingard, whose low shot seems to go straight through Martinez on its way into the net!83 mins: Connolly replaces Maupay for the last 10 minutes or so.82 mins: GOAL! Aston Villa have pulled a goal back against West Ham, a fine first-time finish from Watkins, and another assist from Grealish. They are now 1-2 down.81 mins: Save! Maupay holds the ball up long enough for a few teammates to join him, and Trossard dribbles into the area, heads first one way and then another, and finally blasts a shot towards goal that Kelleher blocks!80 mins: Brighton have 10 men in their own area, and have had for much of the last few minutes. They are therefore unable to break, but Liverpool are unable to break them down.78 mins: Firmino spears a shot wide from 23 yards, and that’s his final touch as Curtis Jones comes on to replace him.77 mins: Salah blasts a shot into Bissouma’s shoulder, and from the rebound Milner’s shot bounces limply into Sanchez’s arms. That’s presumably the home side’s first shot on target, then.76 mins: Another save! Maupay plays a first-time pass to Burn, but Kelleher saves his shot and Burn was anyway marginally offside.74 mins: Save! Gross takes a corner from the left, which comes out of the other side of the area, is sent back in, and deflects to Gross, who has ghosted to the corner of the area. His low shot would have snuck in, but Kelleher palms it away.73 mins: Liverpool are upping the tempo now. Firmino slides a pass through to Salah, but Webster executes an outstanding tackle. Then Oxlade-Chamberlain sends a 20-yarder over the bar.72 mins: Robertson is thus not in the right position when the ball is played down Brighton’s right for Maupay, briefly threatening to cause a bit of chaos.71 mins: Firmino, now in the left-back position and really quite determined not to attack unless it’s absolutely essential, fluffs a pass through to Robertson.70 mins: Chance for Liverpool! A good move ends with Alexander-Arnold in space on the right, and he is able to look up and pick out Salah with his pull-back, but the Egyptian sends his shot high!70 mins: There has still only been one shot on target in this game. “Did a quick dip into Liverpool fan TV and they are having a complete meltdown,” reports Mary Waltz. “FFS is being screamed at least every 30 seconds, the refs are the spawn of Satan and even Klopp is being slagged. Very amusing to this Everton fan.”68 mins: The free-kick is half-cleared and sent back into the area, where Dunk does the most ridiculous mime of being shoved by Phillips. The ball bounces past them both and through to Firmino, but his shot is blocked, and anyway the officials have completely bought the Dunk mime.68 mins: March is unable to continue, or for that matter to walk from the pitch unaided, and Lallana comes on.66 mins: Alexander-Arnold is fouled, not far outside the penalty area, but before the free-kick is taken March goes down, the physios come on, and they spend a while flexing and poking his right leg.65 mins: Origi goes to centre-forward, with Firmino retreating to the left. He really has offered the flimsiest of threats here.64 mins: Liverpool take off Shaqiri and Wijnaldum, and bring on Origi and Oxlade-Chamberlain.63 mins: Milner is fouled by Bissouma 30 yards out, and Thiago lifts the free-kick over the defence towards Firmino, but the ball bounces unkindly and Webster gets back to boot clear. 59 mins: Webster heads high from a Brighton corner, and from an acute angle. They’re dominating this game at the moment.58 mins: The sudden goalstorm continues with Jesse Lingard scoring on his West Ham debut to put his side 0-2 up at Aston Villa!The visitors take the lead! It’s an excellent cross from the right that finds Burn running behind an entirely oblivious Alexander-Arnold at the back stick. He heads it back across goal, where it comes off the side of Phillips’ boot, hits Alzate’s, comes off Trossard and goes in! 55 mins: GOAL! No, not in this game! West Ham have taken the lead at Aston Villa, with Tomas Soucek scoring again.53 mins: Alexander-Arnold picks out Firmino’s run into the area, but the ball arrives at an awkward height. Firmino decides to stoop and attempt an outrageously difficult flicked header, which he completely misses.50 mins: Bissouma’s left leg slides from under him as he stretches his right foot towards the ball, leading to him doing the splits and going down in pain. Not only does he recover, he also does his shoelaces as gets up while still wearing gloves. The coordination of these players never ceases to amaze me. I’ve never got the hang of gloved shoelace-completion.49 mins: Bissouma lifts the ball over Liverpool’s defence towards Trossard, but Alexander-Arnold gets himself in the way and Kelleher collects.48 mins: Nearly a chance! Dunk excellently blocks Shaqiri’s cross, then gets up to get himself in the way of Firmino’s shot.46 mins: Liverpool get the ball rolling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e0f5963a416e4e55aeda0438564d140eb18552/0_172_5168_3103/master/5168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c64f3f5806b1111739d94c832273b51d","title":"decades of progress on extreme poverty now in reverse due to covid","story":"Analysis: The pandemic, combined with the climate crisis and crippling debt burdens, has led to an ‘unprecedented increase’ in poverty, experts warnTwo decades of progress in the reduction of extreme poverty, the elimination of which is one of the sustainable development goals, have been pushed into a sharp reverse by a combination of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the growing climate emergency and increasing debt.With the World Bank warning of a “truly unprecedented increase” in levels of poverty this year, and renewing calls for debt forgiveness, experts are warning of a growing crisis in multiple areas from education to employment, likely to be felt for years to come.While the World Bank was already pessimistic, in January it updated its forecast for the expected number of newly impoverished people this year from between 88 and 115 million to the new range of between 119 and 124 million.But the numbers are forecast to rise in the coming year, and it has not only been in the category of those living below the poverty line of $1.90 (£1.30) a day that increases have been seen. Experts have noted a worrying rise in numbers of people living on less than $3.20 (£2.35) between June last year and January 2021.In recent months the growing crisis has been flagged up in multiple reports looking at indicators from the dropout rate in education in the developing world, to falling wages and rising unemployment, much of it driven by the pandemic, which has closed workplaces, schools and borders, and hammered the global economy.Among those issuing warnings has been the International Labour Organization (ILO), which said global workers lost $3.7tn in earnings during the pandemic.In its annual Global Wage report, issued late last year, the ILO reported that wages had fallen or were growing more slowly across the board in the first six months of 2020 and warned that the Covid-19 crisis was “likely to inflict massive downward pressure on wages in the near future”, with “women and low-paid workers disproportionately affected by the crisis”.The report warned that even in the one-third of countries where average wages appeared to have increased, “this was largely as a result of substantial numbers of lower-paid workers losing their jobs and therefore skewing the average”.But it has been the long-term and less visible effects that are concerning many, not least the impact on education.Among those voicing increasing concern is Axel van Trotsenburg, managing director of operations at the World Bank.“Our concern is that with this crisis we are seeing a reversal in the sustained reduction in extreme poverty and are now witnessing increases. The current estimates are an extra 150 million by the end of this year,” he said.“This is a crisis that has shown just how fragile this progress is, and how much of an effort will be required to rebuild, not least faced with the addition of existing challenges like climate change.“On top of that we are seeing increases in the other poor and unemployed outside of the definition of extreme poverty. It’s a clear sign that this crisis is already producing serious ripple effects.“You have 1 billion kids out of school, and online education not accessible to many children in developing countries. We have done a lot of analysis on this, but just an extra year of school enhances earnings to the degree that if you lose that school year, then the estimate through life, globally, means you are looking at a reduction in world GDP of $10tn.“There is also a disproportionate number of girls who, when they leave school, will permanently quit education so will lose even more.”And while the pandemic has affected countries rich and poor, Van Trotsenburg believes that challenges facing poorer countries are more deep-seated. “One of the major challenges in developing countries is that the majority of employment is in the informal sector.”Andrew Shepherd and his colleagues at the Overseas Development Institute’s Chronic Poverty Advisory Network echo many of the observations of the World Bank and other global organisations.And as Shepherd’s organisation has pointed out, cuts to western aid budgets have further complicated the picture.“These budget cuts leave fewer resources available to tackle the longstanding challenges people have been facing, let alone the immediate struggles of daily subsistence and protection. In this context, the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 will continue to weigh heavily on low- and middle-income countries. And without adequate resources to tackle the overlap of poverty with climate change, conflict, crises of governance and uneven relationships with the global economy, these struggles will only be magnified.”Shepherd points to the risk of new impoverishment in middle-income countries where families have left poverty in recent memory and are vulnerable to sinking back into it.“One of the things that we have been seeing is the impoverishment of new groups who were not impoverished in the normal course of events.”While Shepherd points to the effects of educational dropout during the pandemic as leading to long-term impacts, some of the consequences are less predictable.“We had worked on the hypothesis that this group would be more resilient. And that has not been in the case.“The other big issue is in the urban informal sector in places such as Africa, people like market traders. With lots of markets closing, and the services dependent on them shutting down, that has meant a lot of loss of incomes.”Homi Kharas, a senior fellow for global economy and development at the Brookings Institution, is concerned that for many of the global new poor, the impact of the Covid crisis is likely to last well beyond 2030.In a paper last year, while arguing that some poverty “will be offset as economies start to recover in 2021”, he added that “the longer-term scenario suggests that half of the rise in poverty could be permanent. By 2030, the poverty numbers could still be higher than the baseline by 60 million people.”Speaking in January, Børge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, highlighted another critical issue.“If we’re going to go into pre-Covid levels of global GDP, we will need to start investing in each other’s countries through foreign direct investment – that has gone down dramatically in the last year and a half.”He added: “We also know that the global value chains and trade are struggling to get back to their pre-Covid levels. And we know that trade has been an engine of growth, and has lifted millions of people out of extreme poverty in the last three decades.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edf1939b3a51398fc94678cb5941f4ad9e574264/1_0_4008_2404/master/4008.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8231593a3fcbf4d2a8926941da0b4478","title":"conversations with kids about coronavirus podcast","story":"Children across the UK talk about how the pandemic has affected their livesAnushka Asthana talks to children across the country about what life has been like under lockdown.

Aryan is at home again, which means “loads of sheets of papers to print off” for home schooling, and he says he can’t wait to see his friends again. For 14-year old Becca in Glasgow, the first wave led to her mum being laid off from her job. It meant things were “a little bit harder but we found a way”. She says that if her Mum found it tough looking after her and her three brothers, she didn’t show it. Rory, 18, has just completed his first term at Durham University. He got Covid while he was there and said the experience was very isolating. He says he found returning to Northern Ireland a huge relief. He worries the pandemic has had a big impact on the mental health of people his age.

If it can be done online, it can be done from virtually anywhere with an internet connection. At the same time, however, the move to remote work has revealed the value of the workplace, as many employees hanker to return to the office.In light of these two opposing trends, what might the office of the future actually look like?Elvira Muñoz Beraza, director of the master’s in strategic design of spaces at IE School of Architecture and Design, in Madrid, says that this year’s disruptions will transform offices for the better. “The pandemic has accelerated trends that were already there and has forced companies and experts to have difficult yet necessary conversations,” she says. “The office is the place for collaboration, social interaction and a sense of belonging. This implies less ‘me’ spaces and more ‘we’ spaces: the long open areas filled with inidual workstations or filled with cubicles are gone.”With inidual workstations effectively relocated to people’s kitchens and living rooms, offices are being reconfigured as places that primarily exist for teamwork and collaborative activity – albeit with strict social distancing measures in place and partitions separating different teams and departments.Architects and office planners are already busy with a raft of changes, including larger desks and layouts that make more use of stairwells to reduce the use of enclosed lifts. And, of course, there’s the ongoing drive to minimise the use of frequently touched surfaces, such as taps, door handles and buttons.Beraza is focused on how offices can evolve to meet the changing needs of a company and its employees. “I believe the design of the workplace will need to focus on a hybrid combination of physical and virtual, of inidual and collective, of internal and external actions, tasks and collaboration.”She notes the importance of supporting a hybrid form of office and remote work. “Remote working should stay, combined with physical encounters. Remote work is sustainable because it provides more choice and is more inclusive and erse. The nine-to-five office culture is gone for good.”Lewis Barker, ServiceNow’s senior manager of workplace services, EMEA, believes that, post-Covid, the distinction between “working from home” and “work” will cease to exist. “For many employees, the traditional office and desktop workspace is over. For them, work is wherever they want or need it to be, on whatever screen and digital device they prefer,” he says. “This agile, more distributed ‘anywhere, anytime’ workplace of the future will transform how companies operate.”Barker believes this flexibility will become an increasingly important factor for attracting and retaining staff. “If businesses don’t look to change, whether that’s with a hybrid model or all the way to completely remote, they will struggle to bring in the talent needed,” he says.Within the office, new technologies are being adopted to enable more rigorous safety protocols. Companies are shifting to touch-free sensor technology for handles, buttons and taps, signalling a reverse from the preponderance of pre-Covid touchscreens. Some planners are even looking at technology that will allow staff to control lifts and vending machines using their personal smartphones.“In terms of the conversations we’ve been having about safety precautions in the future,” says Barker, “it’s about trying to reduce the number of touchpoints employees have, whether that’s automatic doors, coffee machines, access card readers and things like that, to reduce any contamination generally.”Other design changes will need to take place, too. Daaf Serné, ServiceNow’s director of global real estate and workplace, suggests this will include allowing more square metres per person, as well as improving the amount of space in high traffic areas, and re-thinking how we can meet and collaborate in our offices. “One thing that will be key, is how technology will influence the physical environment. When thinking about the role that AI will play in the future workplace, it will help us predict when people are coming in and how we can optimisebetter utilise our spaces to support our employees better.

But making the adjustment can be difficult without the proper tools and supportSince the coronavirus crisis began, many of us have adjusted to a hybrid work life that combines working from home with time in the office. But combining these two different styles of working can be a challenge, and employees and employers each have important roles to play to ease the transitions and dispel some common misunderstandings about how to be effective in a rapidly evolving working environment.Below are some of the popular misconceptions about hybrid working that may be ready for retirement.Hybrid working inhibits an organisation’s responsivenessIn fact, businesses have been able to be highly responsive to changes – for instance, when the pandemic’s second lockdown began, businesses were able to shift their workforces back to a work-from-home paradigm with relative ease. Hybrid work arrangements, moreover, allow companies to potentially shift the weight of their workforces in either direction – either toward more remote or more in-office hours – as needed as the pandemic and public policy play out.Organisations have also been quick to respond to new health and safety requirements to keep customers safe – with retailers pivoting to online and click and collect models, even if this wasn’t a core channel for them before. Aldi supermarket, for example, changed its business model to offer online deliveries in response to customers needing to isolate this year. The new service meant it could retain customers, rather than see them going elsewhere.Hybrid working diminishes company culture While it’s obviously harder to foster a shared workplace culture, many companies have found ways to strengthen professional bonds among team members through virtual social events and other activities. ServiceNow, the leading digital workflow company, has offered wellbeing activities to employees, their families and friends, including fitness events, engagement exercises that allow employees to share news and achievements, and an allowance that tangibly boosts an employee’s wellbeing.A culture of innovation should be accessible to employees regardless of where they are working, says Nerys Mutlow, innovation evangelist at ServiceNow, and companies should make a point of demonstrating and sharing how iniduals are being innovative while working remotely, which reinforces culture irrespective of physical location.The hybrid work model impedes mental health and wellness Many companies have been implementing mental health-focused support strategies. “We are mindful that the pandemic has taken its toll on people’s mental health and wellbeing,” says Susanna Yallop, chief people officer at Starling Bank. At the start of lockdown, for instance, the bank launched an internal employee initiative, called Never Home Alone, focused on mind, body, nutrition and personal development, through a series of online events and workshops. Ensuring support is in place and having a holistic approach to health, coupled with the increasing flexibility of hybrid working, can only improve mental health moving forwards.It reinforces outdated gender norms The many reports that working from home has turned back the clock on gender roles, because it leaves women to manage the bulk of childcare and housework, must be taken seriously. But as more working parents negotiate the proper balance of work and parenting, there is also more evidence that fathers are rising to the challenge. For instance, Mutlow says, she’s observed a noticeable increase in dads at school gates, which is an encouraging sign that more couples are challenging traditional stereotypes while providing healthy role models for children.Hybrid working is a waste of office spaceTop architects and designers are already well on their way to creating the post-pandemic office, including new models of desk density, ventilation and common work spaces. The changes will require getting used to, of course, but with change comes innovation, and, in the future, office space may be better used for creative collaborations and knowledge sharing.Hybrid working requires complex technologyThe Covid era has accelerated the demand for technology and collaboration tools that increase productivity, engagement and customer relationships. The digital workflows platform provided by ServiceNow, for instance, has shown that digitising processes makes employees’ jobs easier, which leads to higher levels of workforce engagement and productivity. Those digital innovations have also enhanced the safety of the office environment. Mutlow says: “We’ve created applications to manage the workplace environment safely and we ensure we educate and disseminate the information about what is needed before going into the office, so employees are mentally prepared about what to expect.” For instance, ServiceNow has built a suite of return-to-work applications that enable employees to check-in on their mobile the day before coming into the office and tell employers if they have any symptoms, and book a desk.“It’s important,” Mutlow adds, “that when people do return to the office that they know it’s safe.”ServiceNow gives you the power to make work, work better – no matter the circumstances. So employees can be productive, wherever they are.

Here’s how companies can put their employees’ mental health firstJill was on her way back from a funeral in September, when the message from her line manager arrived in her inbox. It explained that the insurance company she works for had decided that staff needed to begin returning to the office to help keep the business functioning.“It was very uncomfortable as I have two children with underlying health conditions,” she says. “If they got sick, it could be deadly, but my manager was adamant that I needed to return.”With the Covid-19 pandemic set to stretch into 2021, managers can perhaps be forgiven for growing impatient with the disruption posed by remote working. In a bid to get back to a sense of normality, it can be all too easy to unwittingly pressure staff to return to the office, regardless of government advice for people to work from home where possible.Well-meaning encouragement can be misinterpreted by anxious employees as overt pressure. And that pressure can spread through different departments and teams, quickly evolving into a new kind of workplace bullying. There have been a spate of incidents in the UK in which bosses have been accused of bullying staff to return to the office.This highlights the importance of properly supporting employees’ psychological safety as well as their physical safety. “Employers should take on any Covid related queries and try to support their employees as much as possible,” says psychiatrist Sarmila Sinha. “Don’t play down the risk of the Covid pandemic, and make the safety of the employee a priority.”Still, well-meaning actions can be felt as pressure, intimidation, and shaming. While management emails may say no one should feel under pressure to return to the office, this message is effectively contradicted by remarks made during video call meetings – or by managers’ social media posts that applaud those who “bravely” come into HQ. Managers may even reward those who come into the office with one-to-one lunches or meetings that basically function as career discussions, while neglecting to hold video-call equivalents for those working remotely.Mental health professionals point out that this subtle bullying can be counterproductive from a business perspective, as well as being a failure of corporate responsibility. Many workers are already struggling under the economic pressures of the pandemic, so when managers trigger even more anxiety, remote employees can find it harder to focus – thus undermining the practice of remote working and setting off a vicious cycle. Research has long shown there are strong business reasons for employers to take the mental wellbeing of their staff into account, given that healthy employees are more engaged, more productive, and have much lower rates of sickness absence.Employers need to have a healthy dialogue with their staff about working practices in the short to medium term, taking into account each employee’s home circumstances. Some might be living with people in at-risk groups. Others may be struggling with isolation and may actually welcome the opportunity to return to the office.“As an employer, it’s important not to make assumptions about how staff feel about working remotely or returning to their workplace, and remember everyone’s situation is different,” says Faye McGuinness, head of workplace wellbeing programmes at the mental health charity, Mind. “Offer phased returns, or the option of working from home more regularly. You may have to consider options that make journeys into work safer, such as adjustments to working hours. Regularly surveying staff and asking for anonymous feedback is a great way to identify themes and concerns.”McGuinness says it is crucial for employers to make sure staff feel that their voices are being heard regarding any plans to reopen the workspace. Instead of directly asking them whether they want to be in the office or not, a more empathetic approach is to task questions such as: “Do you feel like you need to stay at home in order to be safe right now?” or “Do you feel like you are getting what you need from us in order to do your job?”Software company ServiceNow offers a Safe Workplace Suite of applications to help companies plan a safe return to the office. This includes an Employee Readiness Survey, which helps gauge which staff are ready to go back to their workplace by taking account of their views and assessing their physical and mental health.But holding responsible conversations around workplace location is just one aspect of helping employees with their emotional and psychological wellbeing, particularly as new lockdown mandates are put into place.As a guide for both business leaders and employees, Mind recommends these five ways to wellbeing – connect, be active, take notice, keep learning, and give. Each encompasses evidence-based ways for thinking about mental health both inside and outside of work.Over the past seven months, ServiceNow has implemented similar mental wellness strategies in a remote working environment. “We feel that attending to our employee wellbeing and mental health is more important now than ever,” says Laurent Briant, director of government programmes for ServiceNow’s NextGen programme. “This is a marathon and not a sprint.” Briant says that ServiceNow pays particular attention to the risk of employee burnout, using automated reminders to encourage employees to take regular breaks during the working day and emphasising the need for employees to use their annual leave and prioritise self-care.Sinha agrees on the importance of work-life balance when working from home. “Often employees working remotely feel obliged to work without taking their annual leave or asking for a day off,” she says. “Senior managers and supervisors can offer support to address burnout by reviewing employees’ working hours and ensuring staff are taking breaks while remotely working.”ServiceNow has rolled out a range of programmes aimed at promoting good mental health, including virtual socials to help people feel connected to online workshops offering practical guidance for parents. Central to all this is an understanding that every person’s working environment is different, and that flexibility – both in working hours and when employees are able to be available – is crucial to avoiding burnout and managing the stresses of daily life.One last, critical key to successfully address mental health issues in the workplace is to identify and take responsibility for the source of the problem. “The biggest problem we have regarding mental health issues in the workplace is our tendency to think of these conditions as something to do with the inidual,” says James Wallace, an academic at Swansea University who researches mental health in the workplace. “Rather than thinking about why they might have these experiences, for example because they’re overworked or they have a poor relationship with their boss.”While offering counselling services to employees is a start, Wallace encourages business leaders to look more deeply within the company culture to identify the root cause. “Unless employers are willing to accept that they have a responsibility for the working conditions of employees and make efforts to try to improve these conditions where necessary,” Wallace says, “then we are likely to continue to see employee burnout increase.”The ServiceNow Safe Workplace Suite offers tools for organisations to deliver the right digital experience for each phase of reopening. Including engaging with employees in advance, automating steps for returning, and providing a safe, employee‑ready working environment.

Here’s how to navigate the dos and don’tsWorkplace etiquette was a minor minefield before the pandemic. Now, in the wake of Covid-19, navigating an ever changing “new normal” of office interactions has become a major conundrum. Can you stop for a conversation in a one-way space? Should you get a colleague a cup of coffee? What can you do to make remote workers feel like fully integrated team members?There’s no pre-written rulebook for pandemic work etiquette, so let’s look at a few tips for navigating the new manners landscape.1. Keep your distanceIt’s amazing how quickly we’ve moved from an intimate, close-quarters society to one where people hug the sides of corridors upon passing another human. But good manners here are what they’ve always been. That is, you want other people to feel comfortable and at ease, so you should assume relatively strict distancing even if you are personally quite relaxed. If this seems a pain, there are some real upsides here. No more bone-crushing handshakes and no more awkward or clumsy collisions when a colleague or contact leans in for a peck on the cheek. You just waggle your elbows stupidly at each from a metre away from each other and make a joke about how weird it all is.2. Video conferencing v face-to-faceIf you are working on a hybrid or semi-remote team, there are unwritten rules of engagement. Those who are in the office can pick up on nuance and body language in a way that those who are on a video call just can’t. So it falls upon on-site employees to speak as if everyone is on a video call, taking turns and talking clearly. Resist the urge to make asides or get into rapid fire discussions with your in-person colleagues as this excludes those who are working remotely. It’s hard for remote employees to fully participate when it sounds as if they’ve called into the middle of a rugby scrum.4. If people are breaking the rules …A good rule of thumb here is to treat everyone as if they’re innocent at first. Rather than being aggressive or sarcastic you might say: “Mike, I think you forgot we’re meant to be socially distancing here.” Chances are a reminder is all it will take. However, if the person says it’s no big deal or refuses, you might say: “It makes me uncomfortable or anxious,” or “We all have to obey the rules, even if they’re a pain.” In the first case, you’re making it about their effect on you, not their behaviour and in the second, you’re making it about rules that aren’t set by either of you. Both or are non-confrontational and hard to argue with, especially the former.5. Companies can helpLewis Baker, senior workplace services manager at ServiceNow says that it really helps if companies codify the rules and explain them to staff. “We put together a Return to Workplace playbook, which explains the new workplace experience and behaviour we expect of ServiceNow employees upon return. By the time they came back in, they knew what the guidelines were.” He adds that ServiceNow also supplies some of the basics: “We provide masks. We also offer online mindfulness sessions, you know, cooking classes, nutrition advice, and ergonomic advice. We’ll help you to get set up from home and put support mechanisms in place.” Straightforward rules help people understand what is expected and reduces the risk of disagreement and conflict. Companies should also keep staff up to date as government guidelines and scientific advice changes.It truly is a weird new world of work out there. But by staying respectful and keeping it clean, we can all make it through together – apart.The ServiceNow Safe Workplace Suite offers tools for organisations to deliver the right digital experience for each phase of reopening.

But he added: “I defend the strategy we have adopted with Germany, with the EU.”EU countries are at different stages in their struggle with the virus, with some, such as Italy and Poland, lifting lockdown restrictions and others, such as Germany and the Netherlands, retaining them, mainly over concerns about new variants.France, meanwhile, hopes to avoid a third national lockdown as case numbers remain stable but comparatively high, while Portugal has been hit by a devastating surge and on Wednesday accepted doctors, nurses, ventilators and hospital beds from Germany.Nonetheless, criticism of the EU’s slow vaccine rollout has been building, not least in Germany where media and politicians jostling in the run-up to September elections have taken aim at Merkel and her ally the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.The EU’s decision to collectively purchase and distribute vaccines enjoyed broad support in principle, mainly because of the bloc’s experience in the first wave of the virus when several member states blocked exports of protective equipment.A similar approach to vaccines would have led to wealthy countries such as Germany, France and the Netherlands doing well, while the likes of Croatia and Slovakia would have lost out, the former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb stressed this week.“Small EU states would have had virtually no negotiating power,” Stubb tweeted. “Big states would have swept the doses.” Playing a national card when “the virus does not respect borders” would necessarily be, he said, “a race to the bottom … The key is to coordinate.”But the commission, which had no experience of a public procurement exercise on this scale, handled negotiations with manufacturers more like the trade talks with which it is more familiar, focusing on price and questions of liability rather than securing a maximum of doses fast.That led to late orders and, subsequently, supply shortfalls. Delays have also been compounded by the European drug regulator’s longer approval process, and by several states seemingly being ill-prepared for the doses that have arrived.Many EU countries, however, are focusing on delivering two doses within the interval recommended by vaccine manufacturers and the World Health Organization. By that measure, both Germany and Italy are outperforming the UK.Merkel, Macron and Von der Leyen have all stressed the importance of public trust in the vaccination process, highlighting among reasons for the EU’s slow progress its decision not to follow Britain in seeking emergency approval for Covid shots.Germany, France, Poland, Italy and Sweden have all announced they will avoid giving the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine to over-65s, citing a lack of data on its efficacy among that age group. Belgium has set the threshold at 55.“There is a feeling that if this doesn’t happen too fast, it’s not too big a problem,” Rivière said. “People want to see how it goes. It’s ‘hurry up – but slowly’.” There is anger, too, at big pharma, widely seen as having played games.Fabian Zuleeg, of the Brussels-based European Policy Centre thinktank, said he thought there was “perhaps a slightly different take on the continent, a feeling that speed is not all, that even if you vaccinate very quickly, that does not necessarily resolve everything”.Zuleeg said he “understood the focus on vaccination numbers”, but would like to see a “broader discussion of their role amid other measures in the overall purpose, which is reducing excess deaths and preventing health systems being overwhelmed”.Some European analysts point out that developed countries such as Australia, Japan and South Korea have not yet begun vaccinating at all – and some hope the EU’s approach will end up paying off.“Acting together was the right choice for the EU, although avoidable mistakes were made,” said Stefan Lehne, of the Carnegie Europe thinktank. “Rather than engaging in a blame game, the EU, member states and pharmaceutical companies now need to work together to ramp up production as rapidly as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Push for environmental regulations has alienated voters in the American MidwestNew appointments to Climate Change Advisory Council coinciding with enhanced roleMove will end fossil fuel prospecting and the future development of oil and gas fields"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Government and its agencies finally taking threats of storms seriously"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4475249.1612369686!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"switzerland declines to authorise astrazeneca vaccine over insufficient data","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA healthcare worker prepares a dose of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine at a health clinic in the Copacabana neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Photograph: Dado GaldieriBloombergSwitzerland has become the first European country not to authorise the AstraZeneca vaccine, as its medical regulator deemed there was insufficient data to reach firm conclusions on its efficacy.“For the vaccine from AstraZeneca, the data available and evaluated to date are not yet sufficient for approval,” SwissMedic, the medicines authority of the non-EU country, said on Wednesday. “In order to obtain additional data on safety, efficacy and quality, data from new studies are required.”The vaccine, which was developed by Oxford University and the British-Swedish pharmaceutical multinational, was recently authorised for use in the European Union by the European Medicines Agency. The union expects to receive 40 million doses by the end of March, hundreds of thousands of which will be available for Ireland.However, Germany, France, Italy, Poland and Sweden advised against its use for older people.In Ireland, the National Immunisation Advisory Centre has advised that it would be preferential to give mRNA vaccines such as from Pfizer and Moderna to older age groups due to the limited number of those aged over 55 who took part in AstraZeneca’s stage three trial. It’s understood that the State is revising its vaccination plan as a result.Only 341 people aged over 65 in AstraZeneca’s trial received the vaccine, and 319 were given a placebo, making some authorities deem that too little data is available to show the vaccine’s effectiveness in that age group with certainty.In the EMA’s regulatory decision, it acknowledged a low level of data on its efficacy in older people, but said the balance of evidence supported approval for all age groups over 18.The vaccine was the subject of a fierce row between AstraZeneca and the European Commission last week after the pharmaceutical company drastically cut its expected delivery schedule.The AstraZeneca jab had been as a crucial part in European efforts to get control of the pandemic as it is by a long way the cheapest of all the vaccines the EU has ordered - with AstraZeneca supplying it on a cost basis only - and requires less intense refrigeration than the vaccines produced by Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna meaning it is easier for GPs to deliver.AstraZeneca’s trial data is also being challenged in the United States, where a pension fund has launched a lawsuit on behalf of investors faulting the company for including too few older people, and for a mix-up in the trial in which some participants were accidentally only given a half-dose as one of their shots.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4475152.1612381408!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"holohan backs plan to use pfizer moderna vaccines for over 70s","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe use of these vaccines, based on a new technology called mRNA, in a GP setting had been seen as a challenge due to the demands of storing and administering them, as they need to be kept at ultra low temperatures.  Photograph:  Christof StacheAFP via GettyThe chief medical officer Tony Holohan has said people over 65 working in long term residential care facilities should receive an mRNA vaccine instead of the AstraZeneca vaccine because of their increased risk of mortality.Mr Holohan and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly have also backed plans to give the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to those over 70 where practicable.The High-Level Taskforce on Vaccines and the Health Service Executive have been informed of the decision, it is understood, and are “working through the operational implications.”The use of these vaccines, based on a new technology called mRNA, in a GP setting had been seen as a challenge due to the demands of storing and administering them, as they need to be kept at ultra low temperatures. Family doctors are now working with the HSE to roll out these vaccines to older people, despite GPs, who are seen as key for vaccinating older people living in the community, previously being targeted for administering the more stable AstraZeneca shot. While the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved the AstraZeneca shot for use in all adults, some national health authorities in member states are curtailing its use among older people. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the current vaccination plan will change because of the recommendations, and said this will present a logistical challenge.He said the position is that all three currently approved vaccines are safe and effective but “given the higher efficacy data around the mRNA vaccines, namely Pfizer and Moderna, the chief medical officer recommends it would be preferable to use them where practicable and timely for over 70s… and given the over 70s are the most vulnerable to death and illness if they get Covid 19, the recommendation is that we apply those vaccines, Moderna and Pfizer to the over 70s and that is what is going to happen.”“That will mean a change in terms of the operation of the plan and it will be a significant logistical challenge to the Health Service Executive. They are currently working through the implications of this. They will still be able to commence with the over 70s on February 15th as planned but it will be with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines,” he told the Last Word programme on Today FM. “It means for other groupings, the cohorts four, five, six and seven, that they will be able to come forward in terms of the AstraZeneca vaccine and we also have to complete the second cohort of healthcare workers.”In a letter to Mr Donnelly, seen by the , Dr Holohan said that “due to the superior efficacy demonstrated by mRNA vaccines, including in orlder persons, albeit the data is limited, and in recognition of their particular vulnerability in terms of their increased risk of death and serious disease if they contract SARS CoV-2, it is recommended that mRNA vaccines be administered to all those over 70 years in order to provide the highest level of protection available to this population.“In addition, those aged over 65 years residing or working in long term residential care facilities who have yet to receive their first dose of vaccine, should also receive an mRNA vaccine based on their increased risk of mortality, morbidity and increased risk of contracting the virus in the congregated settings in which they reside and work.” PreferentialThe  reported on Wednesday morning that the advice from the National Immunisation Advisory Centre (NIAC) was that it would be preferential to give mRNA vaccines to older age groups. On Wednesday afternoon, the NIAC published its advice to the chief medical officer, which found that mRNA vaccines “are associated with higher reported overall efficacy which makes them preferable for use in those at highest risk of adverse outcomes”.The committee found that all approved vaccines were suitable for adults, and that “the best vaccine anyone can receive at this time is the vaccine that can be soonest administered”. However, it recommended that while vaccinations should not be delayed, “those aged 70 and older should be given an mRNA vaccine”.  In an update to its GP membership seen by The , the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) said that it is “working with the HSE for the rollout of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines through general practice for patients aged over 70”. “This programme and roll out is not without its challenges from a logistical perspective but in circumstances where General Practice has proven itself to be efficient and effective at mass population vaccines we are confident that it can be delivered as the starting point of this national effort,” Dr Denis McCauley, the IMO GP chair, wrote in a note to members.  Chief Clinical Officer of the HSE, Dr Colm Henry, said earlier that the preference would be to give older people vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna rather than the newly-approved AstraZeneca shot. Advice“The advice generally is to give the mRNA vaccines, namely the Moderna or the Pfizer, to preferentially give those to older people. Based on the evidence we have right now it affords them greater protection,” Dr Henry said in an interview with Bryan Dobson on RTE Radio 1 on Wednesday.“The advice we’re getting from the EMA, through NIAC, is to preferentially give that PfizerModerna vaccine to the over 70s, and we’ll be giving that in mid-February”. Dr Henry said the vaccine will be administered through GPs, “it’s just much more tricky”.The HSE and the vaccine taskforce are currently working on a scenarios to roll out the vaccine through the GP network. However, the challenges associated with the stability of the vaccines are considerable - for example, sources cited the issue of small, rural practices where the 85+ people who are receiving the vaccine may also live remotely, and the associated challenge of safely bringing them together to be vaccinated. It is thought that pooled vaccination centres, where GPs come together in a central location to give shots to their patients, are under consideration. These would differ from the mass vaccination centres as originally conceived in the State’s vaccine rollout plan.

The Abbey said they had not yet been formally approached on the matter, but it would need to be considered by the Dean and Chapter.Brigadier Andrew Meek CBE, President of the Duke of Wellington’s Association (the regiment Captain Tom served with in WWII) told The  if a statue was to be erected in his memory he would be only the second person from the regiment to be bestowed with the honour, the first being the first Duke of Wellington himself.Two in five (38 per cent) of people said Captain Tom should have a statue dedicated to him in Parliament Square, according to polling by Opium Research.But more than half (57 per cent) said a hospital should be named after him.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"golden globes queen vs diana best actress shortlist best director","story":"Netflix dominated proceedings with 42 nominations, after a year in which viewers turned to the streaming service in record numbers.British actors featured heavily in the list, including Daisy Edgar-Jones for her role in the BBC drama Normal People - although not her co-star, Paul Mescal.Anya Taylor-Joy picked up nominations in both the television and film categories, for The Queen’s Gambit on Netflix and in the big screen adaptation of Emma.In the film categories, Carey Mulligan was nominated as best actress for Promising Young Woman.

However, he is the ultimate boss and if he doesn’t like it, now is the time to bring back the hard shoulder and save lives.”Mr Shapps told MPs he had “inherited” the current smart motorway system and commissioned a review of it when he became transport secretary as he was concerned by reports of fatal crashes.He said he was surprised to learn the scheme had been launched without stop detection technology along all stretches and that shortages of kit from the sole supplier meant all smart motorways may not be covered for “many years”.Mr Shapps said: “It is entirely wrong to build a so-called smart motorway without the technology in place to make it safer. That is not the right approach.”He said he is now focused on making smart motorways safer and last year ordered 18 separate improvements, including building more emergency refuge areas and launching a £5 million driver safety information campaign.“People don’t know, as they were just sprung up, how they are meant to drive on these things,” he added. “Or what you should do if you break down on one of these things.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Billionaire Robert Smith avoided prosecution after co-operating with prosecutors in largest ever tax evasion caseBoris Johnson’s chief adviser on Union quits over strategy to counter Scottish nationalismComment: The memory of Captain Tom offers a ray of light amid conflicting messagesComment: The Trumpian EU has demolished its final reasons for existingRishi Sunak concerned scientists are \u0026#39moving goalposts\u0026#39 on Covid lockdownBBC would cost £400 per year if turned into subscription service, says Tim DavieCaptain Cook statues under threat as Black Lives Matter campaigners add \u0026#39genocidal\u0026#39 explorer to hit listComment: Sticking plasters will not fix the fundamental flaws in the Northern Ireland ProtocolProtocol for post-Brexit trade has put Northern Ireland\u0026#39s links to UK at risk and must be scrapped, Arlene Foster saysTurkish president likens LGBT protesters to \u0026#39terrorists\u0026#39 after hundreds arrestedBritain stands out for its tough lockdown, but other countries are juggling the same pressuresGolden Globes: Queen vs Diana for best actress, as shortlist for best director has more women than men for first timeKnife crime surge prompts fears of \u0026#39eruption\u0026#39 of violence after lockdown is liftedMinisters consider extending hotel quarantine as variants emerge in 27 more countriesSir Keir Starmer admits mistake after heated PMQs exchange with Boris JohnsonComment: What is the point of Starmer’s Labour?Heifers go for higher prices than bulls for first time as Britain\u0026#39s most expensive cow breaks recordWhy ministers fear the lockdown exit strategy is shiftingTeachers skipping Covid vaccine queue ahead of elderly, council warnsWithout the Army, Prince Harry will have a gaping void in his lifeBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"memory captain tom offers ray light amid conflicting messages","story":"While hard-bitten journalists and millions who had never met him were shedding tears at the demise of Captain Sir Tom Moore, his example proved a gift amid the conflicting messages of the press conference. Boris, always delighted to deliver stirring news, paid tribute to the dauntless veteran for achieving “more than any centenarian in our history.” After some reluctant hedging over the need for continued caution despite falling infection rates, the PM switched seamlessly into magnanimous “bread and circuses mode. The Daily Mail’s “excellent” campaign for a statue for Captain Tom was, he declared “the kind of thing people will want to support! We’ll be working with his family to see what they feel most appropriate.  Chief medical officer Prof Whitty managed to go one better. After dismissing the puerile harangue he received from a ranter in the street, as “the odd young lad showing off”, he suggested “I’m sure he’ll become a model citizen in time – hopefully like Captain Tom” – proving that even nominally downbeat public health officials can have their Pollyanna moments. The CMO even managed to align the good captain with the carrot aspect of public compliance with lockdown measures. Capt Tom, he said, summed up “how it is that everyone has been responding – if not for that, we wouldn’t see the numbers coming down because everybody worked together. “Hear hear!” brayed the PM, approvingly. And he was singing from much the same hymn sheet. In the face of siren questions about school reopenings, special exemptions for outdoor exercise and the like, he suppressed any instinct to recommend an elbow-heavy rugby tackle or hearty game of rounders.For the most part, he trod a now well-worn path, echoing the CMO’s refrains of It’s too soon to say” and calls for “more data, in substance if not in style. The PM went full Henry V in his patriotic vision of a band of (law-abiding) brothers. He delighted in “incredibly high” rates of UK vaccine acceptance, and (grabbing any opportunity to shove another brick in the red wall) praised local leaders in Batley, Yorkshire for their vaccination efforts. Between the violent agreement and an almost-stifling sense of national unity, things had become a little too agreeable. With no obvious new announcements in sight, this was a reporters’ nightmare. One of the assembled hacks sought to sow discord with a thinly-disguised monologue posing as a question. “How alarming is it that this deep into the pandemic there are still people who don’t seem to understand the gravity of the situation? How frustrating is it for you and your fellow medical professionals?”The journalist was clearly gunning for a bit of ire, but he’d picked the wrong chap for that.Persuading the CMO to say something fruity is an elusive task, like trying to have a cathartically scandalous gossip with Ned Flanders. Instead, the CMO heaped praise on the selfless self-isolators and preached amnesty for the misbehaving few. Again and again, he stressed that those observing the rules were “the overwhelming majority” of Johnny Public. Prof Whitty’s needle, such that it was, was reserved for his questioners. The reason my colleagues implied a highly contagious respiratory virus might surge in winter”, he retorted to one, “is because that is what highly contagious respiratory viruses do.Quietly scathing at the best of times, coming from the mild-mannered CMO, this was positively explosive. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"philip hammonds bogus brexit history reveals true hostility","story":"It is good medical practice to respect patient confidentiality, but when Philip Hammond took to the political equivalent of the psychiatrist’s couch, the conversation was published in gory detail. Hammond has given an interview to a think tank in which he sought to write a bogus history of the Brexit talks, but succeeded only in revealing what he really got up to as chancellor.Hammond admits discussing using a second referendum to overturn Brexit with fellow Remainers. He decided against, in part, because “we didn’t actually think we’d win it”. Instead, he makes clear, he worked to undermine what Brexit would mean. Despite claiming to accept the referendum result, it is not obvious what Hammond thought Britain should leave. The single market? No. The customs union? No. The writ of the European Court of Justice? That was just “theological argument.Nor is he keen on Britain’s new freedoms. Supporting immigration control is “dogmatic”, he suggests, and we should have kept free movement rules. Neither is there much to gain from regulating our own economy. “The Bank of England was always keener on regulatory autonomy than the Treasury was,” he says, as though the Treasury ran the man supposed to run it.Instead, Hammond wanted a “very close associated orbit with the European Union”, in which Brussels set the rules and Britain followed. How many Brits might have been vaccinated in Hammond’s fantasy polity? The answer is remarkably few.This all reflects the man with whom I worked as chief of staff in Downing Street from 2016 to 2017. Unable to resist jabbing at Leave-supporting politicians, envious of Boris Johnson, ignorant of Parliament, contemptuous of ordinary people, resistant to public opinion, reluctant to concede the reality of what Brexit must mean, incredulous that Theresa May, a woman he believed his inferior, could become prime minister, he details a fantasy of what might have been.But it is a fantasy. His account of May’s Brexit speech to the 2016 Tory conference makes no sense. He says she retreated from it in her Lancaster House speech, but there she went further, promising to leave the single market and customs union. Without challenge, Hammond claims May’s speech almost caused a run on sterling. But while sterling fell, the drama came almost a week later after a “flash crash” in Asian markets. Sterling promptly recovered, and an independent investigation blamed a “confluence of factors”, noting it was one of “a series of flash events occurring in fast, electronic markets”.There are further discrepancies. Hammond says he was never a Leaver, but those who worked for him say he boasted for years that Britain must leave the EU. He claims he supported a Norway-style relationship from the start, but he did not say so to May.Hammond’s sneering towards Davis is typical. “Just because he was called the Brexit Secretary,” Davis thought “he was somehow going to control some of this process.” But when the boot was on the other foot, and Hammond was the minister feeling disempowered, he calls the resulting decisions a “coup”. When policy Hammond liked was stitched up in secret, that was just politics when policy was made despite his opposition, it was an outrage. When a Leave-supporting chief of staff drafted speeches, it was unacceptable when a “euro-pragmatist” did, it was commendable. It was his duty, he says, to “reinterpret” government policies he disliked.Thankfully, this is all now history, but history that should not be rewritten. The negotiating “red lines” he dismissed as unachievable have been achieved, Britain has left the EU, and Hammond no longer has to serve his constituents as a backbencher, work he said he “hated”. Instead, he is now a peer, and the best possible advertisement for the abolition of the House of Lords.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day surfing cribbar face transplant","story":"A surfer has defended criticism after travelling 600 miles during lockdown to catch Britain\u0027s biggest wave - dubbed the \u0027Widow-Maker\u0027.

Supporters estimate freeport trade areas could trigger a , jobs bonanza, generating billions for the economy, while revitalising struggling industrial regions. The scheme could allow areas to operate outside the UK’s customs regime, meaning taxes on imports would not apply. They can also offer tax breaks, including waiving business rates and giving companies in the free zones a holiday from paying employees’ national insurance contributions.  But Labour unearthed research from Sussex Universityaposs UK Trade Policy Observatory showing just one per cent of UK imports would signicantly benefit from “tarf inversion” – the main driver of economic activity in freeports. In a paper published last July, researchers Peter Holmes and Julia Magntorn Garrett “explore in more detail whether there are likely to be any advantages for business from tarf inversion in UK freeports”. They say: “Whilst we cannot be wholly definitive, it appears that there is very little such opportunity. “The main exception appears to be in the area of dog food, suggesting the thought, perhaps unfair, that at least one aspect of the Freeport plan is something of a dog’s breakfast.”  They calculated the tarfs on ingredients for dog food and claimed they would be one of the few areas to benefit. Labour seized on the revelation to rebuff claims by ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, that freeports would provide a major boost for post-Brexit Britain. Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson said: “It’s clearer than ever that freeports aren’t the silver bullet for our economic recovery that Rishi Sunak claims they are.  “By reducing many tarfs on goods across the entire UK after Brexit, the Government has undermined its own case for freeports. “Experts say dog food makers are likely to be one of the tiny minority of traders who benefit as a result. “Labour have long argued that the Chancellor is making a dog’s dinner of this crisis – we just didn’t realise it was literally true.” A Treasury spokeswoman said: “This assertion is totally wrong as freeports will benefit from a range of incentives to boost investment, growth and global trade – including tax breaks, reduced red tape and other government support.” A source added that it was “incorrect to say that tarf inversion will be the main driver of economic activity in UK freeports – it is just one small part of the offer”. Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs  freeports would be announced in the first round.

Baffled, the -year-old handed it to her equally puzzled father Wally. The silver key did not fit in any cupboard or door in the house, but it also miraculously disappeared into thin air after being left on the mantlepiece. The strange moment in  was the start of one of the most notorious hauntings of all time as, hours later, the family believe Donald the poltergeist took up residence in their home in Battersea, South London, and stayed for  years. “That night we were woken at am with all this horrendous banging coming from the walls and under the floors and it woke everybody up, including our neighbours” says Shirley, now . “It went on for two or three weeks. The police and the fire brigade were called. The policeman came during the day and noted down what was happening and he said: ‘I think the whole house has had a bit too much cocoa’.”What do you think the truth is  Have your say in the comments section The family – dad Wally, a tube driver, mum Kitty and older brother John – pleaded for the authorities to listen but nothing was done. Soon, Shirley says, Donald became even more menacing: “From there the banging noises started going off during the day too. And the pots and pans that were on the stove and hanging up would fly out and we’d have to dodge them. “At one point, Mum’s clock came off the mantlepiece. It was her pride and joy and it floated across the room and landed on the dining table very gently. “Things were whizzing around and we had to sit there and ride it out.” Now a new Radio  drama-documentary podcast, The Battersea Poltergeist, is reinvestigating the seemingly paranormal events in a bid to finally unlock the -year-old mystery. At the time it made the papers with the press camping outside  Wyclfe Road to try and get a glimpse of what was going on. The Daily Mirror published a story about “Mystery noises that haunt Shirley”. Ghost hunter Harold Chibbett heard about it and offered to help. He visited regularly and asked the poltergeistthey could call him Donald, to which the ghost is said to have delightedly tapped on the table to agree communicating through writing. Shirley shivers: “One day, Mr Chibbett asked Donaldhe could write. He left an ordinary ballpoint pen and paper on the table in the front room and we all came back to the kitchen. He tapped for Donald to write a message. “When we went back, it was really creepy, there was a shaky message and he’d written: ‘I come’. It was months before we got any legible writing. Donald said he couldn’t write with the pen. He wanted a quill.” The family deducted the poltergeist had some intelligence and Shirley says Donald sometimes even played with her. She laughs: “Slippers would walk around the room on their own. They were in front of the fire. They were my dad’s and they would take off and I would chase them up the passage and around the bedroom and try to catch them and he would play with me.” But Shirley says Donald also had a darker side. “We were all treading on eggshells. We had to be careful what we said and didn’t want to upset him because he used to set fire to things. “It started one time when he piled all the tea towels on an electric cooker and it caught fire and Dad had to put it out.  “Another time he set fire to my mum’s double bed and Dad rushed in and he was trying to battle the flames and while he was doing it something pulled him in. “The fire brigade turned up and got Dad away and an ambulance was called because he burned all his arm. “When they got to Battersea General Hospital and cleaned it up they took photographs of it and the consultant said he’d been clawed by a wild animal. “Dad had a terrible arm for about three months because of the burns and he had three claw marks, deep gouges down his arm.” As she got older, Shirley lost friends as the strange happenings continued until . She even lost her job as a seamstress in a London store, when she says Donald stole all the scissors from the workroom. Her grandmother was convinced that Donald was the devil. The family tried to organise an exorcism. Shirley says: “My dad had a co-driver, Mr Hanks. He was a medium and so was his we. He approached my dad and said he could get rid of Donald.  “So we went round to his house one Friday night in Streatham and there was his we and another couple of mediums and a priest and Dad and I. “We all sat in a circle and held hands and Mr Hanks went into a trance and the priest had some holy water.” But the attempt was cut short after the police knocked on the door and accused the party of black magic. The issue was discussed in Parliament and Wally and Mr Hanks gave a statement. Even when Shirley moved to West Sussex after she got married, she says Donald persisted and it wasn’t until she was  that he finally left her alone. She says: “We didn’t have a phone but Donald would leave messages telling me what my parents were doing in London and he’d tell my parents what we were doing in Sussex. He wrote messages and left them around our house.

Bernadette Cooper was last seen alive in January  when she was aged . At the time the mum-of-three was trying to secure loans to save her struggling bar Molly Malones in Spain. Bernadette’s family initially believed she was alive and well and leading a new le following anonymous tip-offs and possible sightings. But Scotland Yard are now investigating the case after she was formally reported as a missing person last year. Her nephew Leon, who is leading the search to find her, fears there is a “sinister explanation” for her disappearance . He said: “Some of my aunts and uncles are still alive and hold out hope but I think in their heart of hearts they know something terrible has happened. “Spain is where I’m getting the most resistance to my questions, for obvious reasons, people are very scared. “If her disappearance was at the hands of others and something terrible has happened to her then our cause will become one of justice to find out the truth and bring anyone involved to justice.” Bernadette and her husband Brian moved to the Costa del Sol in the late s to run a popular bar in Benalmadena, near Malaga. But the breakdown of their marriage saw Brianto England in  seeking a orce. Mum-of-three Bernadette was forced to temporarily close the bar and move to England after falling behind on the rent and spiralling into debt. She approached family members for a £, loan - worth £, in today’s money - but no one was able to help her.  Bernadette, who grew up in Co. Monaghan, Ireland, was last seen alive at The Horse  Groom pub - now renamed - in Tooting, south London. She was in the pub when she called the president of the Irish Bar Owners’ Association in Malaga. She told him: “Do me a favour would you  Tell the lawyer acting for the bar that I have the funds… “Tell him don’t give the bar away – I am on my way back with the money.” A year later one of Bernadette’s sisters flew to Spain to check up on her after she failed to respond to birthday and Christmas cards. She found the bar under new management with no sign of Bernadette. Leon began re-investigating his aunt’s disappearance last March after promising his dying father he would find out what happened to her. Since looking into case he has received threats - meaning he is keeping his age and address secret. Leon believes Bernadette may have been fallen foul of an organised crime gang in the Costa del Sol, known as the “Costa Del Crime” in the s. She told family members she and Brian had been “gassed and robbed” at their Spanish apartment, and the bar was smashed up on another occasion.

Connor Ellis Reed, , was found dead in his halls of residence bedroom in Bangor in October , reports the Daily Post.His body was discovered by friends between his bed and desk when they became worried that he had not been seen for a period of time, an inquest opening was told. Mr Reed, from Llandudno, Wales, hit the headlines in February last year when he was said to have become the first Brit to catch coronavirus. He had been working at a school in Wuhan, China and became ill in November  before seemingly making a full recovery.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.He then left the country to spend time with his family in Australia before moving back to Wales to study Chinese and linguistics at Bangor University. Mr Reed kept a diary while he was in ill in Wuhan, listing his symptoms and sharing his three-and-a-half week ordeal with the world. He described his initial snfle and made notes about the problematic first  days, writing that he believed he was over the worst of the illness on day . But day  brought a relapse - when Mr Reed questioned whether he could be dying. He wrote: Just as I thought the flu was getting better, it has come back with a vengeance. My breathing is laboured. Just getting up and going to the bathroom leaves me panting and exhausted. I’m sweating, burning up, dizzy and shivering.  The television is on but I can’t make sense of it. This is a nightmare. By the afternoon, I feel like I am suffocating. I have never been this ill in my le. I can’t take more than sips of air and, when I breathe out, my lungs sound like a paper bag being crumpled up. This isn’t right. I need to see a doctor. ButI call the emergency services, I’ll have to pay for the ambulance call-out myself. That’s going to cost a fortune. I’m ill, but I don’t think I’m dying - am I  Mr Reed then said he well enough to go back to work after  days of the illness. Acting senior coroner Katie Sutherland told the inquest that the provisional cause of Mr Reedaposs death was given as respiratory failure due to bronchopneumonia caused by combined drug toxicity.

Johnson overruled Patel, Hancock, and common sense itself, by deciding to go with a strategy of targeted hotel quarantine only for a list of “hot spot” countries instead.

Well come on, we all know what a fan of celebrating important dates in the calendar coronavirus is. It deserves to enjoy Valentine’s Day unimpeded. Downing Street have denied – in language some might find strangely specic – reports that two weeks ago Johnson ignored SAGE’s warning that the only way to “get close” to guaranteeing new strains are kept out was completely closing the borders, or introducing hotel quarantine measures for every single person entering the country.  And so, in a week when , people a day are having door-to-door testing in a bid to stamp out the new strain – people with the same new strain can stroll into the UK without any trouble at all. Watch out though - in two weeks time, people with the new strain will be asked to quarantine in hotels, as long as they’ve brought the new strain in from a country we were expecting them to bring it in from. If they’ve brought it from anywhere , happy days. For the new strain.

Samantha, who changed her surname from Grant to Markle, hasnapost seen Meghan for years and wasnapost invited to her royal wedding to Prince Harry in . However, this week she released a -page book on Meghan - The Diary of Princess Pushyaposs Sister: A Memoir, Part One - defending herself and their father, Thomas Markle and saying the truth is stranger than fiction. The book contains chapters titled Markle Beginnings, When Grandma Said the N Word, The Queen Would be Appalled and Looking For Mr Right The Wrong Way. Among the things she discusses in the book is her decision to help their dad, Thomas, set up staged paparazzi photos in the lead up to the royal wedding. She explains that they agreed as they wanted to show him in a true light as other members of the press had been so disparaging, intentionally. She also claims she got no money for the deal.According to extracts of the book seen by Newsweek, she writes: It was just allowing the Royals and the world to see him in his proper light, because he was so horribly labeled and photographed. It was like watching vultures feast. The photographer said, aposDonapost worry, I will take good care of your dad, and nobody will even see.apos She claims that she chocked when she saw their plan had been rumbled, saying they felt they had been baited. Samantha first announced her book several years ago, but itaposs only just been released. There were reports that Meghan burst into tears when she heard about her sisteraposs plans.in  the Daily Mail reported Meghan had told friends that she stopped reading interviews with members of her family after finding out about the first book two years ago and tries not to look at gossip about herself.The friend is quoted as saying: She cried when she found out about it. Out of everything thataposs been said, the one thing that really upset her was that [the book]. She and Samantha never had a very good relationship and she feels her sister is using her position for profit. The back cover reads: Things are not always as they seem, in a world where social labels and perceptions often define who we are, how we live, and how we view each other. With a B.A. in sociology, and an M.A. in counseling, Samantha never thought she would find herself caught in between the cross hairs of media mayhem, as she defends herself, and her father, by dispelling social labels, and fake news, when her sister marries a Duke, and a Royal fairy plummets from the tea towels.

Katie Corrigan - who had been desperate to become a nurse - suffered with anxiety and depression and her family claimed at her inquest that she was overprescribed the painkilling drug. The coroner was also told that Katie, who was  when she died last August, suffered a traumatic event when she was working at the West Cornwall Hospital in Penzance when she was the victim of a serious sexual assault as she walked to her car. Her mother Christine Taylor told the Truro inquest that her daughter did not tell us or her husband at the time about the sex assault and it just festered. But her mother said Katie suffered post tramautic stress syndromeas a result of the assault, Cornwall Live reports. The inquest was told Katie went on to forge prescriptions for herself and she was then arrested and ended in court where she was given a suspended jail term and was struck off. Her mother said: She obviously lost her nursing registration and was devastated by this, her whole career she had worked really hard for. On Christmas Eve  her husband revealed he was having an affair and he left her and their two children. Mrs Taylor said Katieaposs husband Steven told police about the forged prescriptions and claimed he was controlling during their orce and about giving her access to their children. She said Katie was admitted to hospital in  with liver issues and had paracetemol in her system but in November  she took Codeine she managed to buy over the internet and was very unwell after that. Her husband refused access to the children during the Covid lockdown because Mrs Taylor was nursing and Katie did not see the children for five weeks, the inquest was told. Specialist nurse Mrs Taylor said: In lockdown she was devastated. She tried her best to keep herself going but her mood was very low. She was devastated her husbandaposs partner had more control over her children than she was allowed. Her family claim Katie was overprescribed Codeine by her GP surgery and that there were no investigations into her neck pain. A post mortem said she died from a codeine overdose at her home in St Erth, Cornwall. In a tribute to their daughter after the inquest, Katieaposs parents, Fred and Christine Taylor, said: Katie was a lovely person kind, caring, loving and loyal. She had a wicked sense of humour and a smile that lit up the room. She was very much loved by her family, friends and work colleagues and absolutely adored by her two beautul children. Katie experienced many traumatic events in her le, more than anyone should have to endure, which resulted in her battling and suffering with anxiety and depression. She engaged with the mental health services, she desperately wanted help, but unfortunately these were ineffective for Katie for ious reasons - one being unable to access face-to-face consultations due to lockdown. Katie trained as a nurse, a career that she loved and one that she hoped to be in for le, but this was not to be. She was an integral part of our family, a wonderful daughter, sister and auntie and above all an excellent and loving mother. Katie is very much loved and will be missed every day by her family and friends. Her children are her lasting legacy and will be a constant reminder to everyone who knew and loved her.”  The inquest heard how Katie suffered from anxiety and depression.Speaking at the hearing, Mrs Taylor, who is a specialist nurse in  Cornwall, said her daughter was a lovely person but struggled with her mental health and previously suffered miscarriages.She said: She had suffered with depression and anxiety for some time and at some stage she developed a dependence on Codeine. She said her daughter had neck problems and was prescribed tablets to help deal with the pain. She said: She was in a controlling marriage, she had two children to look after, two jobs to sort out and I think her depression worsened. Referencing the serious sexual assault when she was working as a nurse at West Cornwall Hospital, Mrs Taylor said: She had a traumatic event when she was leaving West Cornwall Hospital in Penzance. Somebody followed her to the car and seriously sexually assaulted her. This resulted in post traumatic stress disorder , she didnapost tell us, or her husband at the time, and it just festered basically. Katie then got a job as a practice nurse in Penzance, which she was absolutely thrilled about, but it was hard for her and completely dferent to what she was used to. This was at The Morrab Surgery, where she used her mentor’s username and password to forge prescriptions. It came to light that she was trying to haul a number of pills and as a result she was struck off by the Nursing and Midwery Council.In October , Katie appeared at  Truro Crown Court  and was found guilty of two counts of fraud and one county of forgery. She received a -month custodial sentence, suspended for  months. Mrs Taylor said: She was devastated by this. Her whole career, all the work she worked really hard for, then her husband was basically training to be in the fire service and met someone . He told Katie he was having an affair on Christmas Eveand she had to pretend everything was fine for the children on Christmas Day. When the lockdown started, her husband refused access to the children for five weeks, because Mrs Taylor was still working as a nurse and was unable to supervise visits. Katie was found dead at her home in St Erth on August , , with potentially fatal levels of [the drug] in her system.Detective Constable Neil Goddard, of  Devon and Cornwall Police, said: Having met Christine and Fred on several occasions and spending some time with them trying to get a picture of Katie, itaposs evident they loved and supported her through dficult periods of her le and unfortunately Katie had a history of issues with prescription medication.He said Katie was looking forward to a new chapter in her le and had made plans to complete a second year of university and had put a deposit on her own house at the time of her death. She was going to use the money from her part of the house sale to clear her debts and had made a will leaving her money in trust to her children. DC Goddard added: In the past Katie, it would appear, had considered suicide, from the notes found in her diary. If she had meant to kill herself I would have expected to find a current suicide note and to find her in bed having taken an overdose. He said he felt her death was accidental and not a deliberate act. During the inquest it was revealed by Katieaposs GP, Tamara Curnow, that Katie found a loophole in the surgery’s system which meant she was over-prescribed Codeine. Katie was able to request repeat prescriptions early.

Professor Christopher Gosden said his loving mum Dr Jean Weddell, a medical doctor, had vowed in  to leave him her Edwardian London home. But instead the director of the Institute of Archaeology at Oxford University was left with nothing when she died in . That was after she fell in love with Wendy Cook, a barrister  years her junior, with whom Dr Weddell formed a civil partnership in , at the age of . By the time she died in , she had made a new will, handing nothing to her son but leaving much of her estate to her new partner. The professor later discovered that his mumaposs home - now worth £.m - had been sold without his knowledge in  and that by the time she died three years later, there was just £, left in her estate. Professor Gosden launched a court fight, claiming that a trust scheme his mum set up in  to minimise inheritance tax ought to have given him and his fellow-professor we Jane Kaye the right to veto the sale of the house. He said he would never have let the house be sold, given that Ms Cook - whom he regarded with distrust - would be the ultimate beneficiary of the proceeds of sale after his mumaposs death, following the new will earlier that year. The couple sued the firm of solicitors responsible for drawing up the trust agreement, Halliwell Landau, claiming they bungled by leaving a loophole which allowed the house in Kennington, London to be sold without their knowledge. They were negligent in failing to register a restriction on the house with the Land Registry, which would have kept Prof Gosden and his we in control of whether or not it was sold, he argued. Last January, after battling all the way up to the Court of Appeal, the couple won a ruling that the negligence of the solicitors firm had led to them taking a financial hit. Today Judge Mark Pelling QC, sitting at the High Court, ruled that the firm must pay the academic £,. in damages for their blunder.  Dr Weddell, who died in  aged , regarded her son with affection and generosity and had left him and his we her whole estate by a will she made in , said the judge. At the same time, she set up an estate protection scheme, putting her house into a trust which promised to deliver the property, or the money from its sale, into the hands of her son and his family in a tax efficient manner. Professor Gosden and Professor Kaye were appointed trustees of the scheme, along with Ms Weddell. But in February , she made the new will, leaving much of her wealth to Wendy Cook. Later that year, the house was sold for £,.  Lord Justice Patten in the appeal hearing said Prof Gosden made it clear that the house had been a much-loved family home which his mum was anxious to pass on to her family. He said he believed it was Ms Cook, rather than his mother, who chose to sell the property and many of his answers indicate a deep distrust of Ms Cook and her motives.Dr Weddell had gone to live with Ms Cook on the Isle of Wight, there had been the signicant diminution of contact between Prof Gosden and his mother...and a corresponding concern on the part of Prof Gosden and Prof Kaye about Dr Weddellaposs capacity and what they regarded as the malign influence of Ms Cook in the arrangement of Dr Weddellaposs affairs, he added.

The pink bag was wrapped in sellotape when it was found on top of some bins in Gravesend, Kent, on Friday.Council workers were horried to discover a dead -week old puppy inside the bag, Kent Live reports.The animal had blood around his mouth and his cropped ears had become infected, according to the RSPCA. Animal rescue officer Brian Milligan confirmed that vets also discovered the poochaposs neck had been broken. Mr Milligan said: This poor pup has died in extremely suspicious circumstances and I’m keen to find out where he’s come from and who is responsible. We believe the puppy’s neck may have been broken deliberately which is absolutely abhorrent. But the question remains as to why  “One theory is that he’d fallen ill as a result of the barbaric cropping of his ears. Perhaps he lost a lot of blood or the infection in the wounds had made him poorly and the breeders felt it would be too expensive - and would raise too many questions - to seek veterinary advice  “Vets don’t believe the cropping has been carried out by someone who knows what they’re doing so it looks like a do-it-yourself job as the wounds also hadn’t been stitched up.

The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine was still effective after  days without a top up dose in the recommended time frame, researchers at the University of East Angliasaid. The Government faced criticism over its decision to delay the timing of the second dose of Covid- vaccines until  weeks after the first, with some raising concerns over the level of immunity from a single injection.UEAaposs study comes after a study by the University of Oxford found its coronavirus vaccine with AstraZeneca offers protection of  per cent up to  weeks after a single dose and may reduce transmission by  per cent.The UEA study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, looked at data from Israel where the vaccine has been rolled out.Have you had your vaccine  Let us know in the comments belowScientists found the vaccine becomes  per cent effective after  days - supporting UK plans to delay the timing of a second jab. While it is not yet known how long immunity lasted beyond  days without a second dose, researchers believe it is unlikely to majorly decline during the following nine weeks. But scientists warned peopleaposs risk of infection doubled in the first eight days after the Pfizer vaccine jab, citing people becoming less cautious as a possible cause. Lead researcher Professor Paul Hunter, from UEAaposs Norwich Medical School, said: A recent non peer-reviewed pre-print paper based on Israelaposs experience looked at data from , people who had been given the Pfizer vaccine. It reported that a single dose may not provide adequate protection.  But we saw a number of flaws in how they looked at the data including the fact that they did not attempt to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine from day  onwards. This would have given a better indication of how effective a single dose of the vaccine could bethe second dose was delayed by up to  weeks. Researchers analysed data to see the impact of the Israeli vaccination programme on case numbers, and went on to estimate vaccine effectiveness over time.  They found that after the initial vaccination case numbers increased for eight days before declining to low levels by day . Prof Hunter said: Surprisingly, the daily incidence of cases increased strongly after vaccination till about day eight - approximately doubling. We donapost know why there was this initial surge in infection risk but it may be related to people being less cautious about maintaining protective behaviours as soon as they have the injection. We found that the vaccine effectiveness was still pretty much zero until about  days after people were vaccinated. But then after day  immunity rose gradually day by day to about  per cent at day  and then didnapost improve any further. All the observed improvement was before any second injection.  This shows that a single dose of vaccine is highly protective, although it can take up to  days to achieve this. And it supports the UK policy of extending the gap between doses by showing that a single dose can give a high level of protection.

Birminghamaposs director of public health, Dr Justin Varney said it is important any cases are quickly isolated, but said it wonapost be the only wave of the mutated strain. The Government has set up aposOperation Eagleapos, part of the national track and trace programme, in a bid to stamp out new iants of concern - with people in affected postcodes advised to get tested.That includes Frankley Great Park and parts of Northfield, where two cases have been identied, and are overseen by Dr Varneyaposs department, reports BirminghamLive.Have you had your vaccine  Let us know in the comments belowThis will happen again, said the doctor during a video interview. As we go through the next year we will have this saturation testing whenever we find these iants cropping up. It is really important we seethese cases are isolated - but there is no cause for panic. We simply ask people to not take risks. We are being over cautious to an extent. Please follow the rules. It does not mean lock yourself away, it is not about scaring people, it is about being careful.  Dr Varney went on to say the South African iant is among the mutations that are either most infectious, more deadly or more resistant to the vaccines. Other identied iants include those in Brazil, Japan and the UK - the so-called Kent iant. Several cases of the South Africa iant have been identied linked to travel, with those affected picking it up abroad but now in quarantine.  Dr Varney said the concern comes in when patients are identied who have not contracted it abroad, but from within their community. Downing Street launched door-to-door testing in parts of the country after  such cases were identied earlier this week. Dferent iants are recognised through geno-typing positive tests, looking at genetic history of the sample, which can take four weeks to complete.  Dr Varney said all over s who are living or working in areas identied by the Government are strongly encouraged to take a PCR Covid- test this week through one of the designated sites in their area, eventhey are not showing symptoms. Children are not being tested because it is deemed unnecessary, with the likelihood that any identied positive cases in adults in a household will likely mean the children are infected anyway, he added. The tests must be done at designated sites or using test kits provided as every swab will be geno typed and the result ed in  hours as part of the mass testing process.  Asked why lockdown restrictions havenapost been made any tighter, Dr Varney said: There is no need to close anything additional. Only those who cannot work from home should be in a workplace setting anyway, and employers should be ensuring premises are covid-safe, he said. His message to businesses was to ensure staff were tested and ideally to allow for them to isolate for two days while waiting for the results.

After a car accident, Joe DiMeo, who was left disfigured, received the transplant in August at NYU Langone Health Centre in New York after undergoing a gruelling -hour operation. The surgery was conducted by  doctors and was carried out between two operating theatres. More than  other health care professionals also took part. Today, when the Mirror spoke to Joe he offered a message of support over what hope his historic operation should give to people in the UK and rest of the world who are where he once was. There is always light at the end of the tunnel. Never give up, he said. And appearing on Good Morning America today, he said: “When I saw my face for the first time, it didn’t hit me. It didn’t seem real at first. “The swelling comes down every day. I see my cheekbones now.” DiMeo said he wanted to one day meet his donor’s family. “I’m grateful for them to give this gt to me. I don’t know how to thank someone that gives you a second chance at le,” he added. The -year-old fell asleep at the wheel of his car after working a night sht in . The vehicle blew up, and he was pulled from the wreckage. The explosion left DiMeo with third-degree burns over  per cent of his body. He spent the next four months in a New Jersey hospital’s burn unit, including more than two months in a medically induced coma. His body was so severely burned his fingertips were amputated, and he lost his lips, ears and eyelids. “The therapist actually told me what happened to my body, and I was pretty bummed out at first,” DiMeo said.  “But you know, that was my le at that point, so I had to push through it.” No longer able to live independently on his release from hospital, DiMeo moved in with his parents, John and Rose DiMeo, who became their son’s carers. They spoke of his determination to rebuild his le. “He’s been that way the whole way through, just, ‘What’s next  What do we do next ’” said, John.  “He just kept knocking down the goals... still doing it.” As part of his recovery, DiMeo underwent  reconstructive surgeries. He then reached the point where his plastic surgeon told him there was nothing more he could do to help him regain ality. DiMeo was then connected to one of the world-leading experts Dr Eduardo Rodriguez, at NYU Langone Health.  “A lot of his body was severely burned, andit wasn’t burned, it was scarred from removing skin to cover those burns with skin grafts,” Dr Rodriguez told Good Morning America. “So physically, he was severely compromised, but his spirit was very strong and with great hope to not want to live this way for the rest of his le.” Due to his age, good health, the severity of his burns, and determination, DiMeo was considered an ideal candidate for both a face and a double hand transplant. “I never heard of such a thing before that,” DiMeo said of the transplant.  “But I said, ‘Let’s do it then. If they’re offering it, it must be working out.’” “I was pretty excited. I wasn’t really scared or nervous, I just wanted to get through it.” In August, doctors found a match for him - an unidentied donor in Delaware - who DiMeo had just a six per cent chance of being compatible with because of all of the surgeries he’d already undergone. He has so far not experienced any rejection to the transplant.  “They said that I’m ahead of schedule because, right now, I have  pounds of grip strength, and usually people don’t get that in five months,” he said. “Even on my days off of therapy, I still go downstairs and work out.” DiMeo has also contacted the family of his donor, whom he now has the face and hands of but does not know any details about. “I sent them a letter, but I know they just had someone passed away, so I’m not trying to rush them or anything,” he said.  “I’m very grateful for them to give this gt to me, and I don’t really know how to thank someone that, you know, gives you a second chance at le. I’m very thankful for it.” DiMeo goal is to live on his own again within the next two years, and then have a family, a career and a “normal” and “simple” le. He said he thinks the full impact of his face transplant will hit him when he fulfils another goal, driving on his own again. “It’s pretty interesting to see someone’s face on me, but I guess it didn’t hit me yet,” he said.  “I think it’ll really hit me when I’m driving by myself and, like, I look in the rearview mirror and see myself, by myself, you know, alone.” “I think that’s when it’ll hit me, because driving is my goal, long-term goal, now,” DiMeo said. “It’s peaceful for me.” According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, worldwide, surgeons have completed at least  face transplants and  hand transplants.

Penny conscious Stephanie Bennett is remarkably good at keeping her outgoings as low as possible. Despite having sizeable savings and a good job in a doctoraposs office, she goes to extremes to keep her household bills down. The thrty woman owns a single lightbulb which she moves around the dferent rooms in her home. While the method is time consuming and leaves her temporarily in the dark, it means she saves the equivalent of £ a month. Stephanie also enforces navy showers in her house, restricting her boyfriend Patrick to two minute long scrubs and insisting water is turned off when lathering up. To ensure he follows the rules, the belt tightened girlfriend carries round a baby monitor so she can inform Patrick when his shower time is up. Instead of splashing the cash on on nail and makeup remover pads, Stephanie uses the fluff from her tumble dryer.First off, itaposs clean, she said on TLCaposs Extreme Cheapskates series.And second, I use it so I donapost have to buy cotton pads. Patrick does not seem wild about some of the rules. He said: Stephanie has a lot of money saved up but she doesnapost want to spend nothing. Commenting on the lightbulb rule, he added: Itaposs ridiculous but I do it because I love Stephanie. Iaposm not allowed to take long showers because Stephanie likes to save money for the water bill. I donapost really get to wash my full body, like Iaposm a grown ass man and I should be able to go in there and take a manly shower. Stephanie is also a stickler for savings when it comes to mealtime. As well as pouring left over sauce from her childrenaposs plates back into the jar, she uses beef fat to bulk up dishes such as lasagna which she then wraps in several layers of tinfoil. Instead of popping her tray bakes in the oven, Stephanie slips them alongside bowls and plates in the dishwasher to get them piping hot.  In doing so, she avoids having to power up the oven. When it comes to supermarket shopping, Stephanie peels bananas before putting them on the scales as well as picking grapes from the vine. Fish, hot dogs, lasagne. Iaposm telling you, Iall the time, she said. Patrick, who has to turn off the TV during ad breaks while watching sports games, despairs about how frugal Stephanie is.

The photograph shows what initially appears to be an unremarkable outdoor swimming pool with nobody inside the water. Except a circled area of the poolreveals that a child is in fact beneath the water but practically invisible to the naked eye. The child was captured wearing pale blue shorts swimming near the bottom of the swimming pool but because of the colour he would prove dficult to see by anyone observing.Australian Facebook group CPR Kids, run by expert paediatric nurses, shared the image in a bid to warn parents to make sure their children wear visible and brightly coloured clothing while in the water.  On Facebook the group said: Yes, there is a child there, itaposs hard to believe we know. Following on from out post recently on the importance of fluoroand bright coloured swimwear for kids, one of the CPR Kids Educators was at a pool party with friends and noticed how cloudy the water had become after being used all day. She asked one of the children who was wearing a pale blue swimsuit, to swim to the bottom. The result shocked her, as it did everyone in the CPR Kids team. The original Facebook post has attracted hundreds of comments from those who were shocked by the stark image, and it has since been widely shared since it was put online.  ridiculously beautul photos from the Travel Photographer of the Year awards"},{"url":null,"title":"model told cover up plane","story":"NewsModel told to cover up on plane because outfit was inappropriate for flyingInstagram and OnlyFans model Isabelle Eleanore was humiliated when a Jetstar flight attendant told her \"you cant wear a bikini\" as she tried to board a plane flying from Gold Coast to Melbourne in AustraliamirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video model-humiliated-after-flight-attendant-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Kevin said: “Living in Argentina with an average salary for the United States would allow you to enjoy many luxuries and you would be considered a millionaire. “Many people in Latin America have a misconception of money and,it comes in large amounts, it is always associated with negative things like drug trafficking and illegal jobs. “But money is a motivator and a material way to measure one’s successes in a certain area. “I have always liked to see money as something positive and as a means to play with it, always reinvesting it and getting more, never as an end. “My goal is freedom in all aspects – financial freedom, not only to accumulate money, but a flow of it that allows me and my family to be care-free, to travel, have experiences and enjoy le. “I’m  years old and I’m % aware I am capable enough to keep growing my numbers and I will.” But the entrepreneur is missing one thing – a partner to enjoy his success with.  Kevin said: “Successful, high-paying careers always affect personal relationships, romance and social lives in general. “Those who say that isn’t true are maybe still not wealthy enough to have been impacted. “Unfortunately, it is very common for interested people or ‘gold diggers’ to approach you for your material things and the social status you acquire over time, so it’s dficult to establish new relationships with people. “I have developed a sixth sense of realising other people’s intentions without even knowing them.” As well as struggling to meet genuine people, Kevin is limited by his demanding job. He said: “Entrepreneurs have an instilled concept that time is literally gold and a very limited resource – and I have become a little obsessive about this.  “Maintaining a relationship requires a lot of commitment, affection, care and concern for the other. It is something that each party must invest their time in to make it work. “I think I will be able to do it at some point in my le but won’t force it it will come when the time is right and maybe when I have more time.”For now, Kevin’s focus is firmly set on making  his best year yet as a ‘serial entrepreneur’ – despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.57889008-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.57889008-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.57889008-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.57889008-1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"andrew neave kicked woman in stomach","story":"A sadistic brute kicked a petried mother in the stomach while she held onto a pram, containing her newborn, on a flight of stairs.

We’re battling away and working as hard as we can for each other.“We wanted a reaction from the other nightand we got it at times, we just have to be better on those little details.“We’re very frustrated and we need to start demanding it from each other. It’s getting to that stage.“We want to do well as a group, no one here is taking anything lightly.“We work hard for each other and battle away, we just need that little bit of quality to finish things off.“We can’t feel sorry for ourselves.”Following tomorrow night’s trip to Fir Park, the Tangerines are back on the road again as they head north to face lowly Ross County.Butcher believes both are ‘massive’ games and how they come out of their current sticky spell will tell the team a lot about themselves.The -year-old added: “They’re massive games after we’ve gone through a tough period and we need to come out the other end now.“Tomorrow could be the turning point for that but we have stick together. That’s the only way out of it.“Every team has these tough periods and it’s how you come out of them.“I saw really positive signs on Saturday. I felt good on the pitch and I felt at - we could’ve still got something.“The second goal kills it and I felt like on Saturday we just didn’t get the rub of the green. Little moments – a cross or a pass or a set piece – just weren’t dropping for us.“We’re in that little dficult period that everyone has throughout the season, and probably for longer than we’d like, but we can’t feel sorry for ourselves.“We need to stick together, none of this going against each other, just working hard as a group.“We talk a lot in the dressing-room, there’s a lot of togetherness here and we just need to stick to that because that will get us through these tough spells.”The recent run of poor form sees United in the bottom half for the first time since October.Butcher is convinced their slump of late is not to do with a lack of confidence in the camp and insists they are not hiding from the situation they find themselves in as the slide down the standings.He commented: “I don’t think it is a confidence thing. I think we’ve got boys in there that believe in their ability.“We’re not a group that makes excuses or a club that wants to be like that.“Sometimes you can’t put your finger on it and just have to keep going.🎥 Hear from manager Micky Mellon and captain Mark Reynolds after today#s defeat to Hibernian.#UnitedTogether pic XQJlMyysBmdash Dundee United FCJanuary , “There’s a thin line with holding each other to account because there’s dferent personalities in the dressing-room.“Boys react to dferent things.

For fanatics of our teams on Tayside, it’s been snatched from them.What exactly does that mean for Arabs, Dees and Saintees, though  Dundee fan, and co-host of the Walking Down the Provie Road podcast, Gary Cocker, sums it up well.“I always park in the same place, walk the same way, go in the same gate – I’m a man of routine,” he said.“What I definitely don’t miss is a couple of guys in the stand who shout and scream the whole time!“It’s just nice to have  minutes at the weekend to sit, watch the football and switch my brain off.“It’s familiarity and something I’ve been doing most of my le.“It’s about keeping that connection to Dundee as well because I’ve been in Edinburgh since .“Although there’s Hearts and Hibs nearby, it’s not the same as watching Dundee at Dens.“The thing I miss the most is the anticipation before the start of the half Dundee are shooting towards the Bobby Cox Stand.“That thought of maybe seeing a goal and the players celebrating right in front of me is the best feeling.”Gary, originally from Birkhill but now living and working in Scotland#s capital, has followed the Dark Blues since  after his brother, Craig, introduced him to the club.A season ticket holder, he travelled through on matchdays pre-Covid, using it as an opportunity to catch up with loved ones as well as sample the unique Dens atmosphere.The -year-old added: “It tied in with me being able to see my folks every two weeks. I can’t do that at the moment with all the restrictions.“The game is, obviously, a part of it but it’s not the whole story.“I’ll try watching them playing away – I’ve been to  of the  stadiums and was making good progress up until the pandemic!“All the Lego stadiums – I hate Accies’ ground but I think it’s the away ground I’ve been to most because my we’s family are from Milngavie.“All the games are away for me but Dens holds that familiarity – when I go where I’m all over the place.“If we ever get a new stadium they’ll have to think carefully about how to stop it from becoming a soulless shell of a place.“I’m not saying I want them to recreate the steps on the South Enclosure or leave fox corpses hanging about but I’d like to see Dens incorporated into it.“I would definitely miss it. It’s a pretty costly stadium to run compared to others but it’s still home.”It’s a similar story for St Johnstone fan Kieran Clark. Born in Perth but raised on the Isle of Bute, he now lives and works in St Andrews with football an ever-lasting connection to the Fair City.The -year-old explained: “We went on holiday to Perth – that’s the quality of my childhood, some go to Disneyland, I go to Perth.“We went to a game in  – a top-of-the-table clash against Falkirk in the First Division.“There was quite a big crowd there, it was a sunny day and I’d never been to a game before.“We had to walk all the way from Perth city centre out to McDiarmid Park, we went the wrong way and it ended up about four miles in the end.“When we got there I was blown away by it. The pitch was glowing, it was a decent atmosphere and I’d never seen that many people in the one place before being from a small island.“From that point I became absolutely obsessed.”Kieran, who works in the golf industry and has a season ticket in the main stand, says he “fell in love” with Saints and is itching to get back when possible.“There’s no real family link to supporting St Johnstone – it was really just a day out,” he continued.“Johnny English was on at the cinema at the time so I think McDiarmid Park was better than that!“I fell in love with it and from that point my dad became a St Johnstone fan – he’s a season ticket holder as well.“We actually got beat that day but it’s been a big part of my le ever since.”Kieran added: “I’m a bit of a wannabe hipster. Everyone in my primary school was Celtic or Rangers apart from one Sunderland fan, one Partick Thistle fan and then there was me.“I’d turn up with my St Johnstone programme, sit it on my desk and that was my thing.“We’d travel all the way there for games the following season and the year after when I turned  we actually moved to Perth and that’s when I got a season ticket.“I’ve had one ever since, been to almost every home game and a fair number away, too, all the ups and downs.“It means a lot to me and I’ve had some great moments in the last  years.“I’m itching to get back. My enthusiasm for it hasn’t diminished, arguably it’s even stronger because I’ve realised how much I actually enjoy it and what a void not being able to go leaves.”Although both Gary and Kieran are used to having some distance between them and their first loves, watching from home on live streams doesn’t replicate attending matches.Dee fan Gary commented: “I think, generally, the fans are maybe more disengaged. There is a wee bit of a feeling of distance.“It feels like we are all supporters in name only – like one of those cardboard cut-out fans or like you’re playing a game of Football Manager because you’re not actually seeing it happen.“It’s like collective group therapy and I feel like the mere act of going to a game makes you feel like you’ve done your bit.“Tuning into the stream still doesn’t feel like making the effort. You don’t feel your impact or input.“For the players, they’re not getting that immediate feedback,I can put it that way.“Like when Jordan Marshall dithers on the ball turns back and gives it to Jack Hamilton, he’s not getting anyone going: ‘**** sake!’”Kieran agreed, saying: “It’s a day out. People go on away days but for me the home games are equally like that.“It’s a big part of the routine because you have that at the end of the week to look forward to.“I’ve not been able to go nor have I even been in Perth since or seen my friend Shaun.“I’ve barely seen my dad, which isn’t always a bad thing! But I miss that side of it, too.“It’s not just the game. For me, it’s the whole experience. What I love about the football is it’s the purest form of theatre.“It’s pantomime for adults – you’ve got everything in there. Thrills, spills, excitement, drama and there’s a fair degree of tragedy, too, at times!“There’s also absurdity and humour. All of that comes together and it makes a package that I just love and always have.“For all people criticise the Scottish game, I love the rawness of it and being part of a live game. The atmosphere never gets old.”For most, it boils down to missing the game. For others, it is a personal and heart-rending loss.While those inside the football bubble are caught up in the maelstrom of results, storylines and the minutiae of the game, it is easy to forget what it all actually means.Speaking to supporters brings it home – their passion jumps out.For loyal Arab Craig David, distance was no obstacle pre-Covid either, with him and his Dundonian dad Bryan happily travelling up from Lowestoft, East Anglia, to get back to their roots.In trying times financially for teams across the board, they both bought season tickets for the club’s first campaign back in the Premiership in four years.For the -year-old engineer, whose earliest memories of the Terrors is the  Scottish Cup win, it’s the least they could do.“My dad’s from Dundee so I’ve been supporting Dundee United since Craig Brewster famously put the ball in the net against Rangers in ,” he said.“We used to try to get up three or four times a season, on average.“We’d make a day of it with hospitality but this year my dad and I got season tickets to help the club evenwe couldn’t go.“Nothing beats being under the lights and in the stadium, though.“We usually visit family and because I run the Arabs United fans’ group on Facebook, I put it in there that we’re up as well.“We’d go into The Troll and then The Heggie Suite. We try to do everything we can near the ground and get involved with everyone. It’s always a nice day out, no matter what.“A lot of my friends down here have bought into Dundee United so when I come up next they’re going to come with me.”Craig set up the Arabs United fans’ group on Facebook to maintain a connection with the club from afar after the passing of his uncle Murray five years ago.They honour his le and love of all things United every time they are at Tannadice.Craig explained: “The group, mainly, was to get my dad and I connected with people.“My dad has his friends up there, we used to go on the buses with my uncle Murray but sadly he passed away so there was a big gap there.“We’ve got a plaque for him at Tannadice. We do a little ritual where we go and speak to it or tap it as we’re going down to the ground just to remember him.“He was as hardcore as they come. He used to go to all of the end-of-season dinners and he was very much involved with the club.“My dad and I have kept his name going and taken on the same role to try progress it further with this fans’ group.“When he was ill was just around the relegation yearbut he was alive for all the good moments.“I’m sure he’d have been happy to see us win the Championship and go back into the big time.”Asked what he misses most about the football, Craig added: “Just the atmosphere and father-son connection my dad and I have sitting there watching our team.“He must be proud cheering for his team and then looking over to me and seeing a new generation, passing it down.“As soon as we’re able to, we will % be back, but I don’t mind the streams. Any way of seeing Dundee United is good.“The routine is just making the best of it, seeing your team or listening to them, the main thing is having a team to support.“With Covid and the financial restrictions, I’m just happy to still have Dundee United.”Remembering absent friends and relatives is a feeling also felt across the street at Dens for le-long fan Arran Hill.The -year-old from Charleston, who normally sits in the Bobby Cox Stand with son Oliver, lost his gran, Elizabeth, and mum, Freda, a few years ago and always takes a moment to think about them as he roars on their beloved team.For the Hills, Dundee is a part of the family.Arran said: “When my gran and grandad used to go to the football, everybody on the bus knew them because she’d be sitting there with a flask filled with whisky or vodka.“I get my shouting at the referee from my gran and my mum because they were lunatics at games.“In the days when you could change ends in football, my gran would chase the linesman right up to the halfway lineshe didn’t agree with a decision.“Even now my pals are like: ‘You’re not coming to a match again with me, you’re too loud!’“I always say: ‘If you think I’m bad, you should’ve heard my gran!’“Dundee is a part of the family for me. My mum and I were stewards at the club for many, many years and when I was younger I worked in the canteen and sold the programmes, too.“Gran just loved her football. They stayed directly across from Dens on Provost Road so even when she got older and stopped going to games she could tell by the roar what was going on.“They knew what mood my mum and I would be in when she phoned!”Of his mum’s passing, which occurred shortly after the Dark Blues winning the Championship in , Arran recounted a tale that rams home the importance of football in their lives.He continued: “She passed away suddenly in  from a clot on her lungs. We’d won the league the weekend before at Dens and then the Player of the Year was the following night.“I couldn’t get tickets for love nor money but I managed to scramble and get one and offered it to my mum.“Knowing she was in pain she told me to go. She passed away suddenly the following week.“I had to go and get my dad from Ninewells because he was beside himself, obviously, but it was the trophy parade and presentation at City Chambers that night.“I thought: ‘I’m not going’. My dad, even though he was still hurting, said: ‘If you don’t go, your mum would be mad’.“She’d have told me to go regardless.“Her ashes were scattered at Dens and whenever I go I think of her.”Football is a family affair for Arran and Oliver, with father passing down his passion for the Dee to son.Arran added: “It’s not for me anymore, it’s for the wee man. He’s into it now as much as I was at his age.“After the games he’d always go to the players’ entrance to wait and get photos.“Especially now, I’m a massive Charlie Adam fan, so I’d have loved to meet him with the wee man.“He knows all the players but all the new ones he just knows them from the TV and not actually seeing them. It’s really hard for him – usually he’d be the one telling me who they are and he’s !“He still asks me what time the game’s on and wants to go down.“Usually we’d go to the Penman Lounge butit’s getting used for hospitality then any of the pubs near the ground – the Social Club, Whites Bar or the Clep.“We’d get to Dens in time to watch the teams warm-up. The young lad likes to get there early to chase Cammy Kerr, his favourite player, to get an extra photo with him!“It was me chasing my heroes when I was younger – like Claudio Caniggia and Fabian Caballero. I miss him being able to get that interaction.”Despite everything going on, Arran praised the club and manager James McPake for taking time out of their busy schedule to send Oliver a well-received birthday message.Arran added: “I follow Cammy on Instagram and when I left it late for Oliver’s birthday, I askedhe could do a wee message for him.“He did and Tommy Youngarranged for the manager to do the same.“The fact they did something to wish him a happy birthday, I was over the moon for him.“His face was beaming when he got the messages! I’ve never seen anybody smile so much from cheek to cheek.“When you see those wee eyes light up and he asks you: ‘How did you manage that, dad ’ there’s nothing better.”Keeping the kids entertained is a problem fellow Dee Danielle Ormond knows all too well.And with three Dundee-daft daughters – Lola, Yvie and Elsie – the pandemic has cost her a fortune.“That’s been the hardest thing to adapt to, explaining to the younger generation that we can’t go and see these people,” the -year-old Montrose native said.“It’s really dficult. Yvie’s had her picture taken with James McPake and Cammy Kerr.“She absolute loves Cammy! They miss it loads and are always asking when they can get back but you just don’t have the answers.“They cost me a fortune. Nearly every Saturday I was going through and taking them into the shop, buying something and then taking them for tea.“They can’t stand being in the house all Saturday because it’s just not normal routine.“They ask mewe can just go and drive past Dens because they miss it so much or go by the training ground and seethey can see anybody.“I’m totally demented – I’ve got the whole Dundee shop in my house!”Danielle, who runs a cleaning business and a laundrette in the Angus town, has struggled with not being able to take her regular seat in the main stand as she makes do with PPV games.She added: “I get my Dundee top on but I don’t like it. I’d much rather be going to Dens, your Saturdays feel flat without it.“I sit with Twitter open and blether to all the people I usually see at the game. It’s not the same but it’s just what you would do at the match.“I’d like to get back as soon as possible because you get that support from your fellow-supportersit’s a bad game and you can go for a pint afterwards.“It’s quite stressful and it’s had a massive impact on my le. I feel lost.”For United supporter Ben MacDonald, a season ticket holder in the Eddie Thompson Lower, special moments missed hit home hardest.The -year-old student was gutted Arabs weren’t able to witness the Tangerines lting the Championship title last season and laments the likelihood of the rest of this term passing without their .Ben said: “It just came all of a sudden and my immediate thought was: ‘We’ve got to be declared winners, there’s no way they can take it away from us’.“We didn’t get to celebrate and were hearing things like ‘fans may not be able to get in until ’ and I was thinking: ‘come on, we’ll be in by October!’“Then as the days pass and you realise we’re really not getting in until .”Watching United virtually has been of some solace for Ben in tough times but admits he is still eagerly awaiting the day they get the green light to head for Tannadice en masse.“The online streams have been a saving grace, to be honest,” he added.“You’ve got Twitter and group chats as well – folk are still communicating with each other about games so, although we’re not physically there, I don’t think it’s been too bad.“The news of vaccines has given everyone that bit of hope – surely it shouldn’t be that long before we’re finally back in “Some folk don’t want to risk it but most are chomping at the bit waiting to get the message.“That day will be amazing.”With restrictions across the country only tightening and action below Championship level suspended, it appears that glorious moment could still be some way off.However, when that day comes, it’s clear fans will answer the call and soon be armed with scarves, songs, pies and putdowns. Football and family will emerge victorious.That way of le is all those that truly love the game know.Dundee United’s Calum Butcher issues dressing room rallying cry: ‘Gone are the times you can grab someone by the neck…we need to stick together’\" title\"#Dundee United’s Calum Butcher issues dressing room rallying cry: ‘Gone are the times you can grab someone by the neck…we need to stick together’# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-hibs-calum-butcher-motherwell embed # secretONKsaIW\" data-secret\"ONKsaIW\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"shettleston-gartnavel-auchenshuggle---gaelic-influences-glasgow-place-names","story":"GAELIC was once a signicant local language in Glasgow and its environs and there is still evidence of its influence today."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-i-loved-twist-dennistoun-palais","story":"Which street did you live on  I belong to Glasgowhellip.I grew up in Easterhouse, on Lochdockart Road.

Instead of seizing the initiative to deliver a battle for the Champions League, the Reds now find themselves in a three-way scrap to secure a spot in the new Uefa Conference League.Only the third and fourth teams go into the Conference League. Aberdeen face Hibs on Saturday in a game of huge signicance in the Euro race.After bolstering the attack with Fraser Hornby from Stade de Reims, Florian Kamberi from St Gallen and St Johnstone’s Callum Hendry, it was ironic that the Reds were defensively vulnerable again.After three consecutive clean sheets, they were - down after  minutes. Hornby is a £. million player – but he is not a miracle worker. The defence and attack have to click simultaneouslythe Reds are to emerge from their slump.The loan deals for Hornby, Kamberi and Hendry are highly positive and could revitalise what had become a stale attack, with Sam Cosgrove and Curtis Main netting just six times this season.Although Hornby failed to net on his debut, the potential is there to hit the goal trail. Likewise, Kamberi and Hendry both have experience in the Premiership.However, players are available on loan for a reason – they are not getting game time at their parent clubs.Hornby had not started for Reims and his last game was as a sub on September  when losing - to Paris St-Germain.Kamberi, who could be available to face Hibs, last started for St Gallen on December , while Hendry last started on November .These players will need time to find their full match sharpness. The concern is that by the time they reach their undoubted potential, it could be too latethe Dons continue to drop points.Signing three strikers on loan has also moved the goal-scoring bump on to summer.All three loan strikers are on long-term deals at their parent clubs, with Hornby and Kamberi contracted until  and Hendry .The Dons must secure a long-term, permanent striker this summer # Marley Watkins, who impressed on loan, is out of contract at Bristol City and would be ideal.The exit of Scott Wright to Rangers on a transfer deadline day deal was the best outcome for both Aberdeen and the attacker.Wright had already committed his long-term future to the Ibrox club by agreeing a pre-contract to join them on a three-year deal in the summer.I saw nothing in the two starts Wright made since agreeing that pre-contract to suggest his work rate would drop or that he would not give his all while still at Pittodrie. However, he was subsequently benched for the - draw at Livingston.There is little point in retaining a player who does not want to be at the club, especiallya positive deal can be thrashed out for him.After rejecting a number of offers, they secured £, – a good figure for a player with just six months on his deal who is Ibrox-bound in the summer anyway.Signicantly Wright’s exit also opened up the route to secure Ross McCrorie on a permanent deal six months earlier than initially planned.mdash Aberdeen FCFebruary , The £, for Wright was taken off the £, Aberdeen were due to pay Rangers for McCrorie in the summer. The Dons paid the remaining £,.McCrorie has been in a Scotland squad and is rarely injured. He is consistent and versatile.Although a key player this season, Wright has made just  starts in seven seasons. Aberdeen came out top on this deal.Two years ago this month every Scottish top-flight player signed a petition calling for articial surfaces to be banned in the Premiership.On behalf of their members, PFAScotland submitted the petition to the SPFL. Two years on, absolutely nothing has changed. Those pitches remain.Aberdeen twice travelled down to Livingston in recent weeks only to have the game called off at short notice due to a frozen surface and then a waterlogged pitch.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the COVID- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us.From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government#s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month to fundraise in your  area, you can help to make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk or contact jen.lindsay@nspcc.org.uk by email.Jen Lindsay, community fundraising manager, NSPCC Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"boaters urged to abide by covid rules","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities. RYA Scotland will continue to host online sessions for clubs and training centres and deliver its regular podcast #Off the Water# to keep the boating community informed.PIC:Owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in. _aTarbertHarbour"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 15 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The cost of the items was £., but postage £.!How this can be justied is beyond my reckoning. I have purchased items online where the postage exceeds the cost of the item.

We can set up a chat within  hours and the service can be used as many times as needed.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland, EdinburghDear Alister,In the weeks since the UK left the European Union, I have been contacted by numerous Argyll and Bute residents and businesses who share my very deep concerns about the future sustainability and, indeed, the survival of our vital shellfish and fishing sector.The seafood sector is a vital component of our already-fragile regional economy and is now hit by the inability, virtually overnight, for producers and processors to get their time-sensitive products to market or to customers.If allowed to go unresolved, this sector is likely to disappear, badly affecting Argyll and Bute’s overall recovery and future growth.Fish and shellfish from Argyll and Bute are high quality products of international renown.The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.I am now hearing from long-standing fishing families, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people that,urgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single-family operated vessels, smaller fleets and artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.As a council we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.We are also speaking to Argyll and Bute producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that these valuable products reach buyers.Delays on both sides of the border have already seen valuable products being lost, together with valued customers who are seeking their produce where.Very urgent action and assistance is needed now from your government in order to prevent this traditional Scottish industry sector from disappearing altogether.Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and speeded up.These products need to be prioritised over products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thatrsquos because it helps build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells. These are key to fighting infections.Popular citrus fruits include grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, lemons, limesand clementines.ZincldquoZinc is necessary for a healthy immune system,\" according toMelissa Snover, founder and CEO of Nourished.\"A lack of zinc can make a person more susceptible to disease and illness.\"This essential nutrient helps maintain the bodyrsquos ability to make new cells and enzymes, process carbohydrate, fat and protein in food and also increases the speed of healing muscles and wounds.\"Foods high in zinc include red meat, shellfish, eggs, nuts, wholegrainsand legumes, such as chickpeas, lentilsand beans.BroccoliBroccoli is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. Packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as many other antioxidants and fibre, broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your table. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible - or better yet, not at all.GingerGinger is another ingredient many turn to when they are feeling under the weather. The antioxidant is believed to fight off cold and flu symptoms, combat nausea, and is full of iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium.However, itrsquos worth noting that a study from  showed fresh ginger may help boost the bodyrsquos respiratory system, but dry ginger did not show the same results.GarlicBefore it became a staple in cooking, garlic was actually used for medicinal purposes. From manganese to vitamin B and C, as well as selenium and fibre, it is high in immune-boosting compounds.\"Garlic is a potent anti-viral, anti-fungal agent, and eating it raw, or as an uncooked puree alongside your normal foodwill wipe-out most miscreants,\" Sara Davenport, health expert and author of Reboot Your Health told the .YogurtLook for yogurts that have live and active cultures printed on the label, like Greek yogurt. These cultures may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases.According to Healthline, yogurt can also be a great source of vitamin D, so try to select brands fortied with vitamin D. Vitamin D helps regulate the immune system and is thought to boost our bodyrsquos natural defences against diseases.Sunflower seedsSunflower seeds are full of nutrients, including phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin B. Theyrsquore also incredibly high in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant.Vitamin E is important in regulating and maintaining immune system .

He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.Will vaccine passports be introduced in Scotland In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that. I havenrsquot seen the exact details of what Mr Blairrsquos think tank have said but I imagine itrsquos relatively sensible, itrsquos about doing it globally rather than just an inidual region of the world.What are others across the world saying Zurab Pololikashvili, the UN World Tourism Organisationrsquos secretary-general, last week told the Global Tourism Crisis Committee in Madrid: ldquoVaccines must be part of a wider, coordinated approach that includes certicates and passes for safe cross-border travel.The leaders of Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta have called for the introduction of certicates which designatea traveller has been vaccinated or not.On Monday, Australiarsquos education minister, Alan Tudge, said planned ldquodigital vaccine certicates would allow international students toto study in the country without the need for them to hotel quarantine.Are there any problems with the vaccine passport The head of the UKrsquos data privacy watchdog has told MPs she can see the benefit of Covid- immunity passports, but warned they came with privacy concerns.Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham was asked by MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sportsub-committee on Online Harms and Disinformation about the possible use of special passports to allow those who had been vaccinated to move more freely.She said any such scheme would face substantial questions over its necessity and concerns over the sharing of health data, but warned of creating a ldquotwo-tier system where people who have received a vaccine have more freedoms than

It is stating the obvious, I know, but as we live through another lockdown, it is tempting to focus on the liberties lost and freedoms curtailed, when there are many good things still to celebrate.Not least of these is hope, another word that is used a lot in these days.

The problem is, Smithy, a teacher#s nightmare, causes so much chaos that the head teacher ends up on a le support machine.Enter Dr Hannibal Lecture, the replacement head, and the stage is set for a war of nerves. The musical is on next Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the curtain going up at .pm.West Coast Motors will be extending its local town service to include the school on the three nights of the production.FIFTY YEARS AGOPaul abroadWhile the financial problems of the Beatles are being investigated in London, Paul McCartney is believed to be in America. He left his farm, High Park, on January , after celebrating the New Year there with his we and children.Visit on # but support is neededConfirmation has been received from the mayor of the French village of Montbeliard that a party of Campbeltonians will be welcome at the village#s music festival on July - this year.Provost Dan McKinven told the Courier: #I now propose to call a meeting within the Town Council Chambers of all interested in taking part. I would expect representation from pipers, Highland and Scottish country dancers, choirs and pop groups. Any inidual performer would also be welcome as a cross-section of our community and its talent is essential.#The present plan is to travel directly from Campbeltown to Montbeliard by luxury coach. The village is about km from the Swiss border and the city of Basel.Provost McKinven added: #We would expect to form a committee which would be responsible for organising the finance and travel arrangements for about  people inclusive of press, photographer and artists.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOTwo boys birchedAt a children#s court last Friday – Sherf McMaster Campbell on the bench – two boys were charged with the theft of purses containing money from a house in Burn Road. The crime was admitted.The boys, it appeared, were messengers, and the younger one was in the habit of calling at the house in this capacity daily. The purses were taken on separate days. On the first occasion a purse containing £ s d had been left lying on a small table near the window of one of the rooms. The window was probably partially open. After the younger boy#s visit in the afternoon it was missed.Next day a purse containing s d was left in the same position, and on the boy calling at the house, the occupier challenged him with the theft. He admitted taking the purse and handed it over to the owner. Only  shillings of the  shillings and sixpence remained in the purse.While this interview was going on at the back door of the residence, the older boy, who accompanied the other on the second occasion, appeared to have devoted his attention to the room where the first purse was got, and he possessed himself of the second purse and its contents. His lordship sentenced each of the culprits to receive seven strokes with the birch rod."},{"url":null,"title":"letters january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges. That’s why we are calling for investment in everyday walking to build back better after the pandemic, and respond to the challenges of air pollution, climate change and Scotland#s health record.#Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, said: #We launch our manesto at a crucial point of change for Scotland as we begin to plan for le after Covid-. During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le. By investing in walking programmes and safe, attractive places to walk we can signicantly improve the nation’s health, reducing health inequalities and pressure on our NHS.#Brendan Paddy, director of Ramblers Scotland, said: #Our joint manesto makes a compelling case for investment to make walking safe and attractive for everyone in Scotland.#We believe walking can play a vital role in Scotland’s response to the challenges of Covid- and climate change # and the obesity, bioersity and mental health crises we face.

His we Esther also features on the programme.The film takes viewers through the remarkable achievements of the Lighthouse Stevensons over the course of five generations from the late s to the early s.The programme also features Fair Isle South Lighthouse, which was the last in Scotland to be automated in , with interviews from the keepers serving at the time. It will be aired on March  at pm.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPressure piled on for quick Irish ferry decisionPressure was growing earlier this week on the Scottish Secretary to give Caledonian MacBrayne the go-ahead to operate the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.Scottish Office officials are said to oppose state-owned CalMac’s participation in the project.But earlier this week it was revealed they had asked CalMac to submit a business plan for the route. The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather. Campbeltown and Hearts will make a third attempt to meet on Saturday first, and, weather permitting, the kick-off will be at  o’clock.A favourable balance amounting to £,  shillings and d was made by Dunoon Town Council from the crops grown during last season in the Burg Parks. The income amounted to £,  shillings and d and the expenditure to £,  shillings and d.The large steam yacht Beryl, which belonged to the late Lord Inverclyde, and well-known on the Clyde, has been converted into a cable-laying steamer, and is now the property of the Commercial Cable Company, London. The vessel, which has been renamed George Ward, has left the Clyde for the Thames.The principal celebration of Burns’ anniversary in town was in the form of a concert, held in the Victoria Hall on Tuesday night, under the auspices of the local branch ILP. There was a fairly good audience, and a party of four singers and one reciter from Glasgow presented a programme that was well-received and much enjoyed.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I cannot help but think that it bodes well for the future of that great nation to have a man of faith leading it.Returning to the words, some of the finest and most moving that day came from a young woman called Amanda Gorman.She spoke of lting the gaze of the nation not to what stands between its people, but to what stands before them, of closing ides because they know that, to put their future first, they must first put dferences aside.#The new dawn,# she said, #blooms as we free it. For there is always light,only we’re brave enough to see itonly we’re brave enough to BE it.#In the first chapter of his Gospel, John says: #The light continues to shine in the darkness and the darkness has never put it out.#We are called, all of us, to be part of that light and to be bearers of it into a dark and troubled world.

He will work with inidual police wildle liaison officers, NGOs, the Scottish Government, NatureScot, RSPB, the SSPCA and Scottish Land and Estates. The position is funded by NatureScot.PC Ross was the community police officer for Dunbar, and has  years of police service and an extensive background in wildle crime issues, community policing, problem solving and educational work.Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment Ben Macpherson MSP said: #Wildle crime is despicable and tackling it has been a long-standing priority for the Scottish Government.#We work closely with a number of agencies to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.#The Animals and Wildle Act, which recently became law, increases the maximum penalties for the most serious wildle crimes and extends the time available to Police Scotland to investigate.#The work of the National Wildle Crime Unit is hugely valued by communities across Scotland and we are committed to supporting it. I look forward to working with PC Ross in the future and congratulate him on his new role.#PC Ross said: #When I was in Edinburgh, very early in my service, I became involved in investigating wildle crime because of my interest and experience in this area. I’ve been a part-time wildle crime officer throughout my whole service and the new job is the pinnacle of my career.#I worked very hard preparing for my interview and was very keen to secure the job, which is a dream post. I am looking forward to settling into the role and working with all the dferent partner agencies which are so important in the fight against wildle crime.#In the six weeks I’ve been in post I’ve concentrated on meeting many of the partner agencies we work with in wildle crime. Unfortunately most of the meetings have had to be done virtually, but I feel they have all been really positive and I look forward to building on these initial foundations, especially when we can meet face to face.#The head of the NWCU, Chief Inspector Hubble added: #I was extremely pleased when PC Ross was successfully appointed as our new Scottish ISO and I am sure he is going to be a valuable asset to policing wildle crime.#Andy Turner, NatureScot wildle crime officer, said: #Eliminating wildle crime is huge priority for us, which is why we’ve provided funding for this post since . Wildle crime doesn’t just cause irreparable damage to Scotland’s nature, it also affects tourism, which in turn impacts on the economy.#We are committed to working with NWCU, Police Scotland and other members of the Partnership for Action Against Wildle Crimeto tackle this challenging issue.#We worked closely with Gavin’s predecessor, Charlie Everitt, to prevent wildle crime and raise awareness. I look forward to continuing to this important work with Gavin and the NWCU in the future.#NWCU’s main role is to assist in the prevention and detection of wildle crime by obtaining and distributing information from a wide range of organisations and by helping police forces investigate wildle crimes. NWCU also produce analysis which highlights local or national threats.The appointment of PC Ross comes after the retirement of PC Charlie Everitt, who had spent the last  years developing the role of Scottish ISO within the National Wildle Crime Unit.PC Everitt furthered countless operations, provided expert advice to police wildle liaison officers and acted as the key central point of contact between the police and a vast range of partner agencies.He was well known throughout the Scottish wildle crime arena and his professional knowledge, enthusiasm, and willingness to assist were beyond question.

This adaptation means that they are ideally suited to being houseplants, particularly in homes where the owners are forgetful waterers!Succulent is a general description for plants that have tissues adapted to store water but doesnrsquot refer to a specic plant. On the other hand, cactus is a botanical name for plants belonging to the plant family Cactaceae and, for specic physiological reasons, may not always be regarded as succulents.Succulent suggestionsAmongst the toughest, most robust indoor succulents is the sanseveria, a wide range of plants whose common names include mother-in-lawrsquos tongue , snake plantand birds nest plant .With bold, thick, simple leaves, theyrsquore almost sculptural in appearance, tolerant of low light levels and, because they require minimal attention, theyrsquore an obvious choice for those with little or no experience of houseplants.Sanseveria are particularly good at improving the indoor air quality theyrsquore known to remove air pollutants including formaldehyde, xylene and toluene and, because they convert carbon dioxide to oxygen at night, theyrsquore popular bedroom plants.Another group of plants that are particularly easy to care for are the aloes, which the ancient Egyptians called lsquoimmortality plantsrsquo because they are almost indestructible.The natural healing benefits of aloe vera has made it popular for centuries and is iously credited with the ability to soothe irritated or burned skin, improve skin, hair, oral hygiene and digestion and to treat acne and arthritis.Like sanseveria, aloe requires very little care, tolerates low light levels and infrequent watering, removes air-borne pollutants and oxygenates the air at night, which aids sleep.One of our favourite succulents is the echiveria, which grows in compact rosettes of succulent, sometimes coloured leaves from which flowering stalks may grow.These plants like a reasonable amount of light, some dilute feed when actively growing and prefer under-watering to over-watering. A happy echiveria will produce little plantlets which can be removed and grown into new plants.Carefree cactusIt would be impossible to talk about easy-to-care for plants without mentioning cacti, which have well-developed survival adaptations.Most cacti have developed spines which in fact are highly modied leaves. Not only do these spines help prevent the plant being grazed, but they also reduce the airflow around the plant, which helps it conserve water.Photosynthesis takes place on the stemand its shallow, far-reaching root system enables the cactus to react quickly and absorb any water reaching the ground.Whilst the enormous tree-like cacti of the American desert may be the first cactus that springs to mind, wersquove highlighted some interesting houseplant types below that are incredibly easy to look after and certainly wonrsquot take over your home!There are many dferent shapes of cacti, including round, flat, columnar, smooth, bumpy, ribbed and fluted, and itrsquos important to note that some of these actually change shape depending on how much water is stored in the stem at the time!Not all cacti have fully developed spines. For example, the popular schlumbergera, of which the best-known culti is the Christmas-flowering cactus, has less modied leaves which look like lsquoteethrsquo along the edge of their stems. Their stems grow in lsquosegmentsrsquo and resemble flattened pads, with their flowers being produced at the end of the segments.Although the Christmas-flowering culti is most popular in the UK, there are dferent cultis which flower at dferent times of the year.In their natural habitat, schlumbergera grow on trees or in rocks and generally enjoy shady habitats with high humidity, making them an ideal choice for bathrooms.If yoursquore looking for an unusual and interesting but easy-to-care-for indoor hanging plant, you might consider the aporocactus ndash a group of tree-growing cactus that grow well in a hanging pot.For a cactus with impact, the gymnocalycium mihanovichii is a sure winner. The top part of the stem on this cactus lacks green pigmentand can be bright red, yellow or other amazing colours.So,yoursquore looking for a plant that thrives on neglect, hopefully wersquove given you some ideas!Just remember that the golden rule for cacti and succulents is to under-water rather than over-water ndash too much moisture will cause disease and rot.For more information, take a look on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"mary-contini-column-food-thought-covid","story":"To be able to buy vegetables from the likes of Crunchy Carrot in Dunbar or Phantassie in East Linton is my foodie heaven !It is probably more expensive to shop locally and, as you need to drive to dferent outlets, it does take longer.For hard-pressed working families, this is not always an option.

animalsrsquo excrement was also creating a slip hazard on the footpath.Now, a political party and a bird control expert have called on the local authority to look again at the options available.Among those calling for a rethink is the Animal Welfare Party.Kay Hamilton, Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, is a member of AWP and said: ldquoThe birds certainly shouldnrsquot be killed.ldquoThis is ridiculous and all out of proportion.ldquoNor should the council be thinking of installing netting, as we know many birds can become trapped in netting and suffer horribly before dying.ldquoAlternative solutions

birds, which could then lead to legal issues.Mr Merchant, who previously lived in East Lothian and operates his business from Cambridgeshire, said: ldquoThe very best thing you can do is mesh above the pavement area.ldquoYou completely mesh above the pavement area so you are excluding the birds from either side but leaving the central reservation open.ldquoThat means that the cost of the netting operation is dramatically reduced and, secondly,you kick all the resident birds out from the under the bridge they are going to go to peoplersquos properties in Dunbar and cause a huge nuisance.\"Mr Merchant said that left the birds to roost and perch in the central reservation of the bridge and their droppings would fall onto the road, rather than the pavement.At a meeting of Dunbar Community

Seeds youve sown indoors are also likely to flower earlieryouve given them a head start.Which are the easiest seeds to sow Annuals are a good starting point these plants only last a year, but will give you lashings of summer colour and are great for plugging gaps in borders. They can be started off indoors from February to April, before being transplanted and then put in their final position when all risk of frost has passed.Many perennials, including hardy geranium, echinacea and sea holly, can also easily be grown from seed, although youll need more patience, as some wont flower in their first year.Annuals benefit from nurturing indoors and then hardening off before placing into the garden when all danger of frost has passed.Here are some of the easiest flowers to grow from seed.. Sunflower Growing sunflowers is childs play, and is favoured by parents keen to get their youngsters involved in gardening. They have large seeds - perfect for small hands - and can be started off indoors in February and March in inidual pots in potting compost, and then transferred to their final position in late May or early June.. CosmosThese pretty half hardy annuals come in an abundance of colours, from white to deep pink. They are great for plugging gaps in the summer border with their feathery leaves and daisy-like flowers. However, they wont withstand frost, so youll need to start them off indoors in a seed tray or pots, with one seed per cell.. Nicotiana These annual favourites have a delicious perfume, so plant them close to the house or on the patio once they are coming into flower. Sow seeds in seed compost indoors in early spring, on a sunny windowsill. Sprinkle a small pinch of seeds in each cell, then cover them with vermiculite and water lightly.. Nasturtium These pretty trailers have multiple uses - they can add colour to summer pots, the flowers can be eaten and they can even lure aphids away from French and runner beans - and theyre really easy to grow from seed. Start them off indoors in seed trays of compost in February, placing the large seeds a few centimetres apart on the surface, then cover with another layer of compost, firming it gently. Place a sheet of cling film over the seed tray and put in a warm spot on a windowsill or in a light area. Once theyve germinated, you can remove the cover and in a week or two youll be able to transplant them into seven centimetre pots, before putting them in their final spot in the garden in early summer.. Calornian poppy Calornian poppies can be sown in spring or under cover now. They have delicate ferny foliage and bright yellow, orange, red or white flowers that are a magnet for butterflies, bees and hoverflies. The poppies make good cut flowers and thrive in poor but well drained soil.. CalendulaBeautul orange and yellow flowers are produced from these seeds for an extended flowering period, lasting until the first hard frost and sometimes beyond. Its a great companion plant to include in your vegetable garden to attract beneficial insects and keep the pests distracted. The flowers are edible and can be used in soups and salads. Its also easy to collect seed to re-sow the following year.. Cleome These unusual hairy annuals produce impressive upright stems to .m, with scented flowers in shades of violet-pink, rose-red or white from early summer to early autumn. They are another excellent gap-filler in borders, where they extend colour later in the season, or are great grown in large containers.Quick guide to sowing seedEmma ONeill, head gardener at national horticultural charity Garden Organic , offers the following tips for seed-sowing success.Read the packet. Seed packets carry a wealth of information detailing when to sow, how deep, the spacing required and what sort of temperature they need to germinate effectively.Use organic seed compost. Fill your tray or pot with good quality organic seed compost, first ensuring you dont have any large lumps, tamping down to make sure there are no air gaps, and firm using another seed tray or pot to level it. If the seeds require covering, sieve a small amount over the top and firm again so they are in good contact with the compost.Water before sowing. Use a fine rose on a watering can, or sit the tray in water.Label. Otherwise you may not remember what you planted.Thin out. You may have to thin out seedlings as you dont want them competing for nutrients and water. Remove the weakest seedlings and compost the waste. They will grow towards the light, so turn the tray regularly to ensure even growth."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-waynes-world-edinburgh","story":"The projection is in memory of comic performer Andy Gray, who died recently, and was a huge fan of the Caped Crusader.Andy regularly played the Kingrsquos, where he was known to be a bit of a superhero himself.His superpower was the ability to make audiences roar with laughter, which beats X-ray vision any day of the week.Back problemWITH a David Attenborough sense of awe at the delights of the natural world, the Diary notes that a humpback whale has been sighted in the Firth of Forth.Reader Lucy Davies is equally euphoric about its visitation, though shersquos not so happy about the label we nasty humans have imposed on this proud beast of the sea.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be so much kinderwe called it a whale with poor posture  suggests Lucy.Lynncheon voucherON a related subject, should we believe reader Sandy Tuckerman, who tells us he adores exotic dining and once visited an Inuit restaurant.

How can anyone doubt the threat this poses, and go around feeling insouciant and safe  At a time when every shop door handle holds the menace of a grenade, such an outlook is unfathomable.Yet it is not as uncommon as you might think. Nor is it linked to intelligence or education, or lack thereof. For whatever reason, baffling though it is to those of us who trust reliable sources of information, there are countless iniduals who are adamant that Covid is either a hoax, a conspiracy, or a fuss about nothing and that the vaccines are intended to wipe us out. Behind all this lie malevolent manipulators, intent on...well, quite what they hope to achieve by terrying or killing us off remains unclear, but the fear remains potent.Astonishingly, not all Covid naysayers come to their senses when they fall victim. Last autumn, as cases in the US soared, there were reports of victims gasping for air in the emergency room, yet still insisting that Covid was fake. That really does take the breath away. ROSEMARY: In praise of JennersSomehow, though, it feels worse that anyone here could also deny it. It is not aswe live in a chaotic or rogue state, where we have been deluged in unchallenged propaganda or starved of reliable information. Nor is that information dficult to access. Indeed, one of the most miserable aspects of the past year has been the dogged coverage of escalating tragedy: footage of mortuaries filled with the dead, of serried ranks of coffins in funeral homes, of the mortally ill saying goodbye to their loved ones from behind oxygen masks.Do Covid deniers never watch, listen or read the news, or do they tune in only to what they want to believe  Certainly, down the rabbit holes of social media it is possible to find yourself in a netherworld, so far from reality you could be a character Alice in Wonderland. Except that Alice kept her wits about her, and never lost her grip on sanity.Alarmingly, as is becoming clear, the pandemic is only the latest of the fault lines opening up between people whose world views lie at opposite ends of a spectrum. We can mock thwarted Trump voters who continue to believe that the election was rigged, despite not an iota of evidence to support that conclusion. Unlike Covid, where the facts are omnipresent, the US election result has been contested without any foothold in reality. Believing the Democrats cheated says more about protestersrsquo state of mind than about what the ballot boxes contained.And yet, their certainty and grievance are real therersquos no denying that. Nor is any of us entirely immune to being manipulated by tricks or lies. You can point to the Brexiteer threats of a tsunami of immigrationwe stayed in the EU as an egregious hood, but many of those who swallowed it whole were already at a point where it merely bolstered their convictions, rather than shaped them.When it comes to medical denial, there is a long and sorry history of refusniks. Just think of John Gummer, obliging his daughter to eat a beef burger on camera to show that there was no danger of Mad Cow Disease . The government similarly played down the dangers of contracting salmonella from eggs, until Edwina Currie spoke up.The more facts and figures we are bombarded with, in our never-sleeping news cycle, the trickier it becomes to find a reasonable position between unquestioning credulity and healthy scepticism. For years it was possible to be a climate change denier, and remain intellectually credible. Now, yoursquore considered nuttyyou still donrsquot get it.What is troubling about those who refuse to believe what is happening around them, despite the evidence of their own eyes, is that it doesnrsquot make sense. It suggests wholesale disparagement, mistrust or terror of those who run the country, a determination to find hidden and sinister motives behind every announcement and regulation.Some deniers, doubtless, have no guiding principles or cosmology whatsoever, and simply prefer to ignore the wider world beyond their walls. In general, though, the level of suspicion and the passion with which untenable beliefs are held are motivated by something far stronger than lack of engagement. Discrediting Covid even when it has you in its grip denouncing global warming, despite the wildfire sweeping over your house, suggest advanced paranoia and a sense of persecution. ROSEMARY: In the footsteps of medievel pilgrimsNor is such an outlook entirely unreasonable at all times. Leadership in many countries is at worst despotic, and at the best, frequently mendacious, opaque, contradictory and evasive. Traditional media outlets deliver news that is properly researched and sourced, yet often biased in tone or emphasis. And the web is awash not just with documented fact but with misinformation that goes largely unchallenged.The fact that anyone can seriously and sustainedly deny Covidrsquos existence is merely the tip of an iceberg wersquove been trying to ignore. It is a shocking demonstration of a breakdown in societal trust and cohesion. When people refuse to acknowledge reality, and choose instead to believe what they want to believe, facts, truth, testimonies, photographic or recorded proof are cast aside as irrelevant.Despite the decline in religion in the West, maybe there is an ongoing hunger to put faith in the unprovable and intangible, an urge for creeds and a community of the likeminded based on unveriable feelings and imaginary connections. Who knows what makes people enter a parallel world to the one beneath our feet. Personally, however, I find the idea that facts and evidence no longer matter even scarier than Covid.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Its asTony Blair had sacked Gordon Brown in . It has brought to a head three isions which have shattered the unity of the Scottish National Party: the Salmond affair, the transphobia row and the lack of progress toward independence.Ms Cherry had called for Alex Salmond to be readmitted to the party after he was acquitted of all sex harassment charges last year. This did not endear her to the party leader. Next week, Mr Salmond is scheduled to give evidence to the Holyrood inquiry investigating how the Government came to lose a total of pound, fighting a doomed defence against his judicial review in . There has been a clearing of the decks in advance of this appearance, in which the former leader is expected to blow open the conspiracy he claims led to his downfall.Read more: The jury found him innocent but Alex Salmond is still on trialMs Cherry has also been an inconveniently outspoken supporter of womens rights. Indeed, she may be the first senior politician to be sacked for believing that a woman is an adult human female. She is a lesbian and a feminist who does not accept that womens sex-based rights should be sacriced on the alter of an ideology which denies that sex is binary. In short, she does not believe ldquotranswomen ARE women. For months, Ms Cherry has been the target of vilication, abuse and even death threats from numerous trans activists in and out of the party.This is such an arcane issue, baffling to the vast majority of Scottish voters, that it seems hard to believe it could have come to this. But Nicola Sturgeon has staked her reputation on driving through a new Gender Recognition Act which will allow men to self-identy, legally, as women merely by making a declaration to that effect. Last week the First Minister made a thinly-veiled attack on Ms Cherry in a video accusing her own party of transphobia. Yesterday, amendments to the much-criticised Hate Crime Bill that would have protected ldquogender-critical women like Ms Cherry from prosecution for ldquostirring up hatred were suddenly withdrawn by the Justice Secretary, Humza Yousaf.The key amendment gave freedom of speech protection to ldquodiscussion, criticism or rejection of concepts or beliefs relating to transgender identity. It also protected ldquostating that there are only two sexes and using the words ldquoman and ldquowoman to define a persons sex. The deletion of these amendments could mean that women who object to the presence of natal men in their changing rooms, or in womens sporting events, may in future be committing a criminal offence.The SNP NEC has been trying to enforce a new definition of transphobia in which even the phrase ldquoadult human female would itself be regarded as hate speech. However, it is also the dictionary definition of a woman, andquoting it is to be regarded as transphobia then there might have to be a bonfire of biology textbooks. Universities could have trouble teaching medical students about binary human reproduction.Read more: Dont tell women what makes a woman: they were born that wayMs Cherry is an experienced advocate and the best legal mind in the SNP. She took Boris Johnson to the Supreme Court in  over his prorogation of Parliament and won. In recent months she had been advocating a legal route to independence through court action on Indyref. This is a route which Ms Sturgeon has reportedly endorsed herself. So it might seem perverse to dispense with the services of the only figure in the party with the legal expertise to prosecute it. But in the SNP right now legal expertise appears to be regarded as a threat.These issues have been boiling and roiling beneath the surface of SNP politics for the last two years. The waves of scandal have been lapping around Ms Sturgeons ankles as she tries to deal with the pandemic. Now, rather like Chairman Mao in , she has decided to deal with troublesome opposition by launching a purge, and giving a green light to trans activists in her youth wing, who are highly organised on social media.There is a generational ide in the SNP. Many younger nationalists are zealous advocates of identity politics. Older, analogue politicians, like the former Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill tend to side with Mr Salmond and Ms Cherry. The influential Wings Over Scotland blog, penned by the Rev Stuart Campbell, which was essential reading for independence supporters in , is now calling for the resignation of Ms Sturgeon and the ldquowoke legions who are her new praetorian guard.Wings has been assisting the former British diplomat, Craig Murray, in his attempts to disclose details of the alleged conspiracy against Mr Salmond. Mr Murray is in turn defending himself against contempt of court charges relating to the Salmond trial. Another prolic SNP blogger, James Kelly of Scotland Goes Pop, has called on Mr Salmond to launch a new independence party.Like most SNP intellectuals, Mr Kelly had been arguing that it would be senseless to promote ision on the eve of a crucial election which could trigger independence. The SNP lead in the polls indicates a landslide in May. However, he now believes the situation is so dire that the two wings ndash no pun intended ndash can no longer coexist.The truth is that many in the party no longer believe that Ms Sturgeon is serious about delivering independence ndash at least not in any timescale they would regard as acceptable. Thousands have reportedly left in disgust. Ms Sturgeon dominates Scottish opinion polls and the opposition parties are disarray. Her biggest political threat now comes from within her own party.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Vessels  and , currently in some  state of unreadiness at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow, were supposed to address these challenges by now on the Arran and Uig-Tarbert-Lochmaddy routes.Instead, they have become symbols of what Holyroodrsquos Rural Affairs committee described as a ldquocatastrophic failure of procurement processes. The saga doubtless has a long and legalistic passage to run. Meanwhile, the islands will continue to need modern, reliable ferries.Out of this mess, it should still be possible to identy opportunity as well as catastrophe. However botched the process, too crudely tied to a short-term political imperative, the intention of building these ferries on the Clyde to save an ailing yard was honourable enough.The conclusion should not be ldquonever again so much as ldquoget it right in future. That requires a strategy rather than ad hoc actions. It needs a belief ndash self-evident where in northern Europe ndash that a nationrsquos maritime status should sustain, and be sustained by, a healthy shipbuilding sector.We will never again build great ocean liners on the Clyde but the disappearance of that tradition has been translated too easily into the shorthand that ldquoshipbuilding is finished, apart from the BAe yards tied to Ministry of Defence orders, which are secure for the next  years.But need it be like this  As the Holyrood committeersquos report put it: ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to the procurement and construction of new vessels hellip has been short-term, piecemeal and lacking in strategic direction. Change that state of affairs and a lot of opportunities arise ndash and they extend beyond CalMac ferries.It is at least possible that Brexit creates that opening. For decades, membership of the EU was blamed for our inability to use public procurement as a means of supporting our own basic industries, and none more so than shipbuilding. If that can be changed, then let us have the good grace to recognise it.From my own experience, I think the EU was more an excuse than a reason. In the CalMac case, there was a long-term civil service agenda in Edinburgh to fragment and privatise. This eventually led to the separation of infrastructure and operations, the theory being that any operator could then compete to use ferries and piers.I remember discussing this with the most senior relevant official in Brussels who insisted the Commission was not interested in Scottish ferry services but ldquo something is waved under our nose often enough we have to do something about it. So the split was created between an infrastructure companyand the operators, who have ndash despite the theology of the issue ndash continued to be CalMac.Now we are outside the EU, I would scrap CMAL and replace it with an agency with a wider remit to use public procurement to the maximum advantage of the Scottish shipbuilding and marine engineering sector ndash with the prize of industrial revival and skilled jobs in parts of Scotland, particularly the Clyde, that desperately need them.A ldquowhite paper on this theme, produced by the Glasgow-based Malin Group, estimates close on a billion pounds worth of vessels are in the Scottish public sector pipeline not just CalMac but local authority ferries, fisheries protection, Northern Lighthouse Board and so on. But how much will stay in Scotland  On current form, very little.Public procurement, their report concluded, is ldquothe essential foundation for reviving civil shipbuilding on the Clyde with all available facilities brought into play to provide the flexibility that proved to be lacking at the Ferguson yard alone.Add in the requirements of aquaculture and renewable energy, which can certainly be guided by Scottish Government policies and requirements, and the potential order book for a Scottish shipbuilding revival becomes even more promising. It is an exciting vision.However, it certainly will not happen without firm policy leadership and co-ordination. If all these public sector bodies continue to do their own thing, the opportunity will be lost. We will still be building ferries in Germany and Denmark while the industrial work-boats float over from Holland.There is responsibility too on the UK Government to make this possible. How are the terms of Brexit going to be interpreted  Are there to be new freedoms to use public procurement as the key to industrial regeneration  Andnot, then what is the point It is a classic example of why the two Governments need to work together towards a shared objective. Potential positives for the Scottish economy should not be shunned just because they can, in part at least, be attributed to leaving the EU. There are plenty disadvantages, so we might as well have some advantages also.None of this ignores the need for home-based industries to be competitive. In the longer-term, it may be unsustainable to force public bodies to pay more for vessels that could be procured from where in Europe as has become the norm. But there should surely be an opportunity to put that to the test.Scottish public procurement as the basis of a Scottish shipbuilding revival.

It looks like itll take time to rid the SNP of the coterie currently in charge. The \"glorious union\" will be safe for another generation, by which time, I and many others shall be feeding the worms.Drew Reid, Falkirk.ARE WE DEEMED TOO STUPID AS the vaccination programme proceeds, I am astounded at the volume of disapproval directed by unionist politicians at the Scottish Government, based on comparison of Scottish and English statistics. Are we expected to conclude that this in some way has a bearing on the case for or against independence  Is the implication that Scots, as a nation, are intellectually deficient compared to their southern neighbours and would be incapable, regardless of their political allegiances, of electing a competent Government in an independent nation  Or is it another example of the myth peddled by unionists that an independent Scotland would be a one-party state governed in perpetuity by the SNP The competence or otherwise of inidual politicians or political parties has no bearing on the democratic deficit so clearly summed up on these pages by Ruth Marrwho described Scotland as a nation held prisoner the overwhelming numerical facts mean that the cell key will always be held by voters south of the Border.Finally, as an aside and as a member of the over- cohort, I would add that very few acquaintances of my generation have expressed any dissatisfaction with their own vaccination experience.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.BREXIT AND THE PANDEMICWHILE I understand the concerns of John Dunlopregarding the need for constitutional change during a pandemic, I also have concerns. In spite of the pandemic, the UK Government pursued Brexit. This was the greatest change to the UK constitution in  years. It was not prepared to extend negotiations until such time as the pandemic was over. The UK Government demonstrated perfectly to the SNP that it is possible to carry out constitutional change during a pandemic.Duncan Stirling, Cardross.* SOMEONE called Alister Jack has been popping up in The Herald in recent days.

Is this to be tolerated  Can a witness simply pick and choose whether he will attend There is something very rotten at the heart of this matter, and it is time that either the committee was given full powers to compel witnesses to attend and provide answers to questions or  the entire shebang was handed over to a properly-constituted judicial inquiry, with full judicial powers to compel witnesses to attend and to answer questions, on pain of judicial sanctions. The way this affair has been conducted suggests that the people in charge of its constitution are treating us all aswe button up the back.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.WAS JOHNSON PANICKING CHRISTOPHER H Jonesseems to believe that the Scottish Governments proposal to freeze council tax for a year is politically motivated, while at the same time persuading himself that the sole purpose of Boris Johnsons visit to Scotland last week was to \"support our wonderful scientists, NHS workers and the Army\".Instead, during a day when he ignored his own oft-repeated injunction to \"stay at home\", Mr Johnson spent time keeping key staff off their work, travelling  miles from his home and, quite possibly, risking spreading the virus. The real reason for the visit, I am convinced, was the onset of panic at the string of Scottish poll results showing a majority for independence.As for Mr Joness advice to pensioners to \"squirrel plenty of money away\" to pay for future council tax rises, I would ask Mr. Jones: what with Alison Lambie, Stirling.SPINNING OVER THE VACCINESJANE Laxhas fallen for the UK Governmentrsquos spin over Covid jags, as England has similar problems over supplies.On January , NHS England advised that all care home residents and staff would receive their first jag by  January ldquoat the latest but letters only went out last week. At the weekend several leading care home operators in England complained that only around a half of residents had been vaccinated due to a shortage of supplies.England also experienced the same problems over Sunday vaccinations, as the UK administered , doses on Saturday, January  but only managed around half as many the following day.Extrapolating from the Scottish data that the UK Government tried to suppress, the UK may be administering vaccines at around half the pace it receives supply, yet the same UK Government and the unionist parties are spinning and politicising the vaccine roll-out in Scotland.This of course has been taken up by the media, including the BBC, yet they steadfastly refuse to publish the easily-available comparable number of cases and mortality rates in the four home nations as this shows Scotland in a much better light thanks to the tireless efforts of our NHS staff and Nicola Sturgeonrsquos clear leadership.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh EH.PENALISED FOR SHIELDINGMY we and I are both  and I must confess I am bemused by the logic behind the vaccination programme in our health board area.The s and s have been vaccinated by our hard-working GPs in a local centre set up within the village a few minutes walk away. My we and several of our friends neighbours of a similar age received their letters on January  inviting them for vaccination on February  at the town hall of the adjacent town some three miles away, not a problem. Being previously placed in the shielding category and thus considered \"extremely clinically vulnerable\", I received my vaccination invitation on February  for an appointment on February  at a centre set up in another town eight miles distant. Therefore being placed in the vulnerable group has resulted in my having to wait longer and travel further than would have been the case had I been left in my age group cohort.I am in the fortunate position of being able to drive. If this were not the case I would have to have left the house before am taking a total of three buses to arrive for my : appointment. Irsquom fairly certain that the appointment time could be rescheduled but the three-bus journey would remain.

Private companies ask customers to be patient with staff who are operating from a working from home situation, but no similar allowance is given to teachers or pupils who have had to constantly change to the new circumstances. In addition, teachers are also dealing with their own work-from-home lives, which may include home schooling their own children. They have adapted lesson plans while simultaneously teaching, and were given notice by the Scottish Government only days before the school term was due to finish before Christmas about the sudden change in circumstances. They support children and young people by creating normality and routine to help protect their mental health against a backdrop of uncertainty and change.There must be consideration for the stress on children of learning from home, feeling overwhelmed by the volume of work. Itrsquos unrealistic to expect children to deliver a normal level of productivity when theyrsquore isolated from their peers. I know several parents who are struggling to keep their children motivated piling on school work adds to that stress for both and may result in more of these children falling further behind. There needs to be greater appreciation of the mental health impact of children to concentrate for long periods in these conditions.As a parent of a Lenzie Academy pupil, I donrsquot recognise the complaints and can only speak well of their approach. A letter was sent on January  to parents outlining the blended learning plan. The school gave adequate explanation regarding this.

We are about to move to Lanarkshire, where the figures show a worryingly long wait for treatment .At the beginning of April  after feeling unwell I suddenly dropped unconscious to the stone-tiled kitchen floor. An ECG reported atrial fibrillation. Two months later the cardiology specialist suggested I may have sick sinus syndrome where the heart pauses and may or may not restart.Four months on from my initial event, frustrated and very anxious awaiting further investigation, I posted a statement on the Care Opinion website. A consultant cardiologist contacted me and set up a treatment plan which involved having a cardiac monitor implanted in my chest. This monitor confirmed a few months later that indeed my heart was having short pauses and the treatment required was a pacemaker.Irsquom alive and well at present but things could have been dferentI had not had the motivation and the ability to seek help.How many people have had to wait for treatment to save their le because of a lack of funding to provide more doctors, nurses and facilities to treat cardiac disease Margaret Edwards, Bridge of Allan.WHERE ARE THEY ALL GOING WE are being encouraged to stay at home and only travel for essential purposes.

This briefing contributes to that knowledge.Thomas Sampson, Associate Professor of Economics at the LSE, noted: ldquoThe costs of independence to the Scottish economy are likely to be two to three times greater than the costs of Brexit.ldquoMoreover, rejoining the EU following independence would do little to mitigate these costs and, in the short run, would probably lead to greater economic losses than maintaining a common economic market with the rest of the UK.His co-author Patrick Schneider, a PhD student at LSE, added: ldquoWe show rejoining the EU will only support the Scottish economy in the long-runa costly condition is met that the move to independence reduces trade with the rest of the UK by so much the EU becomes Scotlandrsquos largest trading partner.The researchers analyse the impact on Scotlandrsquos economy of potential changes to trade barriers resulting from Brexit and Scottish independence and calculate their combined economic hit would leave Scottish incomes between pound, and pound, per capita per year worse off.They say their estimates reflect the long-term effects of Brexit and independence, noting how it could take a generation or more for the full consequences to materialise in the meantime, the rest of the UK would remain Scotlandrsquos biggest trade partner.The report concludes: ldquoA complete account of the economics of independence should also consider changes in technology, foreign investment, immigration, currency arrangements and fiscal transfers as well as studying the distributional consequences of independence. But our analysis shows that, at least from a trade perspective, independence would leave Scotland considerably poorer than staying in the United Kingdom.Responding to the analysis, Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Economy Secretary, said: ldquoAs an independent member of the EU, free from the damage of Brexit, Scotland would be part of the huge single market, which is seven times the size of the UK.She argued there was ldquono reason whatsoever why Scotland could not emulate the success of similar-sized independent countries, which were far wealthier per head than the UK, noting how Norwayrsquos GDP was nearly % higher than the UKrsquos.Ms Hyslop pointed out the study had not taken account of any changes in migration policy, inward investment or the economic levers the Government of an independent Scotland would have control of to boost the economy.ldquoWith our economic resources and advantages, control of economic policy and membership of the EU Scotland would be very well placed to grow the economy.Maurice Golden for the Scottish Conservatives said the LSE report underlined the risks of the SNPrsquos desire to have a second independence referendum this year.ldquoThe Scottish Conservatives wonrsquot gamble our economy and jobs, unlike the SNP. Our focus is on the recovery and rebuilding our country after the pandemic, declared the partyrsquos economy spokesman.Noting how the Treasury had already given pound billion to help Scotland cope with the pandemic, the MSP added: ldquoScotland in the United Kingdom is vital to our economic recovery.Scottish Labourrsquos Anas Sarwar insisted the analysis confirmed the SNPrsquos plan for an independent Scotland would lead to deeper austerity, which was why his party opposed it.ldquoThe dficult years ahead of us must be about economic recovery, not inflicting further economic pain on our communities and people who are already struggling, declared Scottish Labourrsquos constitution spokesman and candidate to be its next leader.ldquoRather thanto the old politics of ision, the next parliament must be a Covid Recovery Parliament that focuses on bringing people together, he added.Pamela Nash, Chief Executive of Scotland in Union, described the report as ldquodevastating and claimed it exposed the economic damage the SNP wanted to inflict on people with its negative vision for Scotlandrsquos future.ldquoLeaving the UK would take money away from vital public services like

It pains me to see that with % of our children out of school as a result of school closures, we risk taking away opportunities from our own coming generations.“The pandemic has illustrated better than most things the full consequences of the digital ide, with which we have lived for too long we see those areas of the country that have access to connectivity and those that do not, and the families who have broadband and sufficient devices for everybody to get home schooling opportunities, and those who do not. So when we come to the end of the restrictions and to rebuilding our economy, we must also look at rebuilding our own education system.”Reflecting on the impact of Government plans to renege on the . per cent Gross National Income target for international development, a Liberal Democrat policy while in Government, Mr Carmichael said: “Giving opportunities to young people in the developing world is not some act of altruism it is actually good for our own children and communities. I look at the work that has been done by Anderson High School in Lerwick for decades now through the Global Classroom Partnership, and I see what that has added to young people in Shetland. “The money—in hard cash terms—that we would be required to put in to meet the .% GNI target would already be much reduced not actually to meet that . per cent target is criminal.

However, it’s been particularly dficult for those in the islands given broadband constraints and the fact that more parents are expected to work since we’re in a Level Three area.“While everyone is clearly adapting and doing the best they can, the obvious benefits to young people of being at school, both in terms of their learning and social interactions, cannot be overstated.  Indeed, in her statement to parliament this week, the First insisted the government would use ‘every inch of headroom’ available to them to get children back to school safely.“On that basis, it seems logical to look seriously at the possibility of applying a more localised approach to the reopening of schools.“I appreciate that there will be many factors to be taken into account, but I welcome the Education Secretary’s recognition of the case for a more ‘tailored’ approach, where this can be done safely.

This will be used until a full restoration of the new cable can be completed.In addition, new overhead lines will be constructed. This follows around seven kilometres of lines being removed following the successful installation of the new cable.An SSEN spokeswoman said: “Following positive test results, plans are now being progressed to temporarily reconnect the cable until full restoration of the new cable is complete.#This includes the construction of .km of overhead line between the old and new subsea landing points in Hoy. SSEN is currently reviewing construction timescales but expects short-term works to be complete by late February , subject to suitable weather conditions.”The spokeswoman added: “There will be some restriction to electricity generation export during the period of the fault. SSEN remains committed to engaging with all generators connected to Orkney’s Active Network Management system to manage any generation constraint that may be required and will look to minimise disruption wherever possible.“SSEN will provide regular progress updates to stakeholders throughout the period of the fault.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points. The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process.

MCHA are also pleased to support the project via their Fairy Pools carpark income and have granted funds to modernise the shop’s IT system.“We are all really excited about creating a really great little community shop.

The people are so open, friendly and welcoming – even to this Irishman – and the characters are great.“As we are  miles from the nearest supermarket, the shop really is a leline to many, especially in these times where people are sheltering and when the winter grips the roads.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/363-Katherine-Dix-Ceit-at-spinning-wheel-outside-Nissen-Cottage-from-Alison-Dix-daughter-via-EM.jpg","title":"traditional journey of the swelling","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSometimes we can follow the journey of a specic story by comparing earlier texts from the great collections of the th century with later recordings, especially those in the School of Scottish Studies archives available online at the digital archive Tobar an Dualchais. We catch characters, plots and inidual episodes changing to reflect new environments, audiences and times as each version is transported by the carrying stream.How a story changes informs us about the people who tell them – their culture, beliefs, and worldview. A setting may be changed to make a story more appealing to a local audience. An episode may be omitted because it isn’t seen to be relevant – or because it is too sensitive. The same story may be repeated because it is an effective warning: be wary of the wilderness lying beyond our township’s boundary.With the help of Tobar an Dualchais, we can follow one story’s journey from Highland moor to the island of Hearmatraigh, near North Uist, in real-time. Folklorists call this kind of story a migratory legend: where the same type of story is told in dferent areas, but with dferent settings and characters, localised where it is told.Catherine Dix, or Ceit an Tàilleir, was a remarkable storyteller who contributed hundreds of items to the School of Scottish Studies Archives. Born in , Ceit spent her early le in Beàrnaraigh, before moving away for work on the mainland at the age of . After a prolonged time away, she ed with her family to the island at the start of World War Two. She was recorded extensively during the s and s.One traditional story features a shepherd and his dog who stay in a shieling overnight. A hag arrives to warm herself by the fire. She swells to the size of a peat-stack, remarking that it’s only her ‘plumage’ rising with the heat. The hag attacks the shepherd but is driven away by the dog. The story is often called ‘m’ iteagan is m’ oiteagan’ : the phrase appears in most iants of this tale.Ceit recorded the story on at least three occasions in  , and with Iain Paterson , himself a native of Beàrnaraigh employed as a collector for the School of Scottish Studies. The  recording is transcribed in the excellent  publication by Ceit’s granddaughter, Alison – Ceit an Tàilleir.Ceit clearly enjoyed telling the story, but during a decade of performances it changed its setting: from a nondescript Highland moor in , to an unnamed island in , and finally to Hearmatraigh in . A story, originally set on the mainland, is gradually reworked by the storyteller, perhaps to make it more appealing to an island audience.It’s in the nature of migratory legends to change – it’s what makes it easier for them to migrate in the first place. But can we also trace where the story came from  Where did Ceit first hear her story: in Beàrnaraigh, or where Folklore recorders are trained to ask about where tradition comes from. At the end of every story, Iain Paterson would ask Ceit where she heard the story. In , she mentioned her father, Archibald Macleodfrom Baile Mhàrtainn in North Uist. But in the  recording she offered an extra explanation: the story in fact came from Archie MacColl of Ardtur in Appin, where she worked on a farm between the ages of  and  years. Paterson, clearly intrigued, asks how the story came to be set in Hearmatraigh. Ceit replied that Archie MacColl had heard the story from a boy from the Outer Hebrides who was working for him.It’s interesting that Ceit maintained here that the story was set in Hearmatraigh in both versions she heard – the one from her father and the one she heard as a teenager working in Appin. In her first recording she had set the tale in the Highlands.By comparing this story and its episodes to similar ‘migratory legends’, we can try to trace how it might have spread. The villain of Ceit’s story is the ‘swelling hag’. This redoubtable character is met with in a type of traditional story that once was told across Eurasia. It is known by folklorists as ‘The Two Brothers’.In the Scottish Gàidhealtachd, we have a version of ‘The Two Brothers’ recorded in Beàrnaraigh. It is called ‘Cailleach na Riobaig’and was collected in  for John Francis Campbell’s ‘Popular Tales of the West Highlands’ project. Despite similar wording between the two tales, Ceit’s story contains episodes not present in the  tale, episodes resembling other versions of the story collected on the mainland, east of Appin.On the whole, Ceit’s story is more similar to these mainland versions than anything recorded in the Outer Hebrides. Although she told Iain Paterson in  that both versions of the story she had heard were set in Hearmatraigh, it may be that, to make the story more attractive to an island audience, Ceit deliberately relocated an originally mainland story to the Sound of Harris. This comes through in the changing setting of her three versions of the story.But why Hearmatraigh  In relocating her story, Ceit chose a location which preserved the kind of setting in the original mainland story. She keeps the shieling, an outpost of civilisation in the wilderness where many stories tell of conflicts between human society and the supernatural.Hearmatraigh might have been chosen as it was one of the principal islands where Beàrnaraigh folk would stay in shielings for short periods to hunt, fish, and harvest peat. One recording on Tobar an Dualchaisnotes that the bothy on Hearmatraigh was built using lime-mortar: this construction technique would have made it stand out among other island shielings built of stone and turf.The Hearmatraigh settlement was centred around the natural harbour known as An Acairseid Mhòr. It is very likely that the fishing station from the time of Charles I mentioned by the Hebridean author Martin Martinwas located here. Could the fishing station’s ruin have been later repurposed as a shieling It may be, then, that when Ceit was looking for a local setting for the story she had originally heard in Appin, moving the tale to Hearmatraigh made it more relevant and appealing to her listeners. But with this clever transfer she also skilfully preserved the cultural signicance of its original moorland setting: a place out in the wilderness where dangerous supernatural creatures could overwhelm the unwary.Ceit Dix’s stories demonstrate the richness and iety of Gaelic traditional culture and offer a glimpse of how skilled storytellers adapt and localise their tales to entertain and intrigue their dferent audiences. contains some , oral recordings of songs, music, poetry and factual information made in Scotland and further afield."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1611861061543.jpg--paul_watters__prawn_and_red_pepper_chowder.jpg?1611861061000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210128newspaul watters prawn and red pepper chowder","story":"INTERNATIONAL chef, Paul Watters, has over  years experience in the culinary industry.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!

There is a carefully rehearsed procedure of name taking, mask changing and hand sanitising at the initial entry point where these vital duties are among the many roles taken up by volunteers such as Arthur Halligey who was the first greeter on Friday morning.Arthur, part of the Volunteer Now group, is just one of an army of citizens doing their best to help out with the operation and their dedication and community spirit has been hailed as vital by Sinead OKane, Assistant Director of Governance and Risk Management - essentially the woman who is charged with keeping the process running smoothly.A good description for Sinead would be a cocktail of irrepressible energy mixed with an indefatigable sense of humour.Sinead is obviously very serious about her role and she has her fair share of stories about her experiences during the course of the pandemic, but when this grim periodfades sooner rather than later, Ill take a bet that her motivational skills will live long in the memory of all those she has worked with.And like all good leaders, she knows the worth of all those around her who have thrown their energies into the process.IN IT TOGETHERSineads team really does bring meaning to that somewhat cliched phrase of were all in it together - in their case it has never been more important to be all in.From the start this has been a massive logistical operation with literally every department doing their umost to provide this service.I cannot speak highly enough of these people. Everyone - volunteers, the administrative staff and of course the nurses, midwives, Allied Health Professionals and NIAS and support services have really been all hands to the pumps , she says.The timetable for vaccinations is, of neccessity, honed down to a fine art. We estimate that from entry to exit, the process lasts around  minutes - and half of that is spent seated post-jab as a precaution on carefully cleaned chairs adjacent to the exit where recipients receive their final documentation.Behind the scenes, the flow of the all important vaccine is controlled by a team of pharmacists under Deputy Head of Pharmacy for the Trust, Stephanie Tohill, who reiterates Sineads words on the united effort.I’ve got the greatest respect for everyone involved, she says. Hard to believe weve been doing this for six weeks and we have a long way to go as we move through the ious age groups.So what does this monumental operation come down to  Saving lives is the very obvious answer. Protecting health and social care services is another major factor.But Sinead, in typical fashion, boils it all down to one word - people.Im sometimes almost overwhelmed by the reactions we get from the people who pass through. “They are so kind with their words and their support.The one incident that really sticks in my mind is a conversation I had with a gentleman on palliative care who received his vaccination.He looked at me and thanked us all, saying this means I dont have to die alone. That hit hard.But then she added with typical humour: In fact he ended up having to console me!In a pandemic riddled with cliches theres one that holds very true. If you didnt laugh, youd cry.Lets all hope that the efforts of all those behind the operation at the Seven Towers Leisure Centre bring some much needed fun and laughter into all our lives.

Before the UK left the EU, Johnsons of Whixley sold £, of plants to Northern Ireland customers every year.The company said new and impractical restrictions had hampered long-standing trading relationships.Plants which originate from a bare root young plant, or those that have had any contact with the soil, evencontainer grown, are considered a risk because of the likely legacy of soil residue, which has the potential to carry pathogens or nematodes, Johnsons said.While not impossible, soil residue removal is impractical and would defeat the point of rootballing and containerisation.Long-standing customers of Johnsons and many other nurseries are left with no choice but to go directly to EU suppliers because there are no restrictions on legacy soil residue between EU members or affiliates in the guise of Northern Ireland. Johnsons head of production and procurement Jonathan Whittemore said: This legislation penalises UK growers and gives an immediate competitive advantage to EU suppliers, who may go on to monopolise supply into an existing part of the UK at the expense of our business and the wider industry.Belfast Most ReadBelfast Cltonville Road murder victim linked to dissident republicansFoster condemns UVF #show of strength# after masked men patrol Belfast streetsDissident Danny McClean murdered in Belfast had spent five years in British ArmyNI teen who wouldn#t stop singingFields of Athenry to police fined £ and told to learn whole songNI traffic alerts: Motorist trapped in car after floodingLatest Northern IrelandEdwin Poots feeling well after undergoing cancer surgeryOur family will not stop in our fight for justice, vows daughter of murdered Danny McCleanShots fired at Coleraine housePolice probe storm drain where teenager Noah Donohoe discoveredPermanent solutions needed to NI Protocol to ensure unfettered access: DUPLatest from Belfast The NHS and care workers who have died during the coronavirus pandemicCarlo Ancelotti impressed with Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s defensive dutiesRussell Crowe sends birthday message to British sailor on round-the-world tripEdwin Poots feeling well after undergoing cancer surgeryLeaders Manchester City pull clear while Liverpool lose at Anfield once again,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On behalf of my party, I want to express our sincere sympathies.”DUP Councillor Errol Thompson added: “It was very sad to learn of the passing of Captain Sir Tom Moore. He was a great inspiration. For a man of . then  years of age to walk constantly for NHS and the amount of money he raised right across the UK was unbelievable. Our party wishes to be associated with the remarks of sympathy to his family.”Independent Councillor Emmet McAleer also expressed his condolences adding: “The money that Captain Sir Tom raised during his activities was absolutely inspiring.”However, when pointing out NHS funding cuts are “a complete indictment of the Conservative government,” the chair, UUP Councillor Diana Armstrong cut in, refusing to allow him to continue.She said: “I am insisting on respect in these messages, so I am ruling that out of order.”Councillor Josephine Deehan, Independent told members she was “greatly saddened” on learning of the death of Captain Sir Tom.“I watched television images of him doing his rounds and doing everything within his power to raise funding for the NHS, an institution which he valued so much. He was willing to put in that supreme effort, she said. I think’s it’s truly extraordinary. A great inspiration, especially to those of us who spend so may hours sitting behind a desk – there he was, getting out, doing his bit. He was truly inspirational and we are all greatly saddened at his passing.”Next to speak was Independent Councillor Donal O’Cofaigh who also referred to Captain Sir Tom’s “inspirational efforts”.He said: “Sadly, it takes people like that, at his age, to raise funds in this way. This was genuinely done in an inspirational manner. This is a man who faced down the threat of fascism and he knew the value of the NHS which was created on the back of that victory. We can’t let go of our NHS.”Concluding, the SDLP’s Councillor Paul Blake told members Captain Sir Tom: “Became a very inspirational figure during a very dficult time when we were overcoming the pandemic. To see his movements every day and the amount of money he raised was a real inspiration. We owe a great debt of gratitude.”Belfast Related ContentGail Walker PremiumGail WalkerOpinionTomorrow will be better, thanks to true hero Captain Sir Tom MooreThey do say that you never can tell who,anyone, will turn out to be a hero - there#s no way to know until the crunch comes. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e-bbe-a-eb-ebdffa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e-bbe-a-eb-ebdffa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e-bbe-a-eb-ebdffa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e-bbe-a-eb-ebdffa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e-bbe-a-eb-ebdffa_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UK‘Inspiring’ Captain Sir Tom Moore’s legacy to be formally markedCaptain Sir Tom Moore’s mammoth charity efforts are to be formally honoured, as tributes were paid to the inspirational veteran.ViewpointViewpointOpinionSir Tom Moore#s heroic effort won#t be forgottenWhen the history of the coronavirus pandemic is written there will be few heroes to laud apart from the indefatigable NHS front line staff.

other than a race to ensure that everyone is vaccinated globally to protect those who are most vulnerable from this virus - including those in low-income countries.“That’s why the global effort to ensure the vaccine gets to those countries is crucially important and the UK’s playing a very signicant role in that.”Read MoreVaccinated people must continue social distancing, warns chief medical officerHe continued: “In terms of summer holidays, no vaccine is % effective, even a % effective vaccine means that % of people are not protected.“There is no way of knowing those who are protected from those who are not protected. “What we hope with these vaccines is that even those who are not fully protected will get some protection from severe disease,indeed they become infected.“Because we know that evena vaccine doesn’t prevent you getting disease,you get disease, in many instances it can alter the severity of that disease and you may get a milder illness.Dr McBride added: “It’s an inidual choice and people will make up their own minds and it’s probably too early to be planning for the summer just at this stage.” Read MoreArmagh and Mid Ulster retain highest new infection numbersCovid-: Almost a year since the first case was detected in Northern Ireland,what have we learned Belfast Most ReadBelfast Cltonville Road murder victim linked to dissident republicansDissident Danny McClean murdered in Belfast had spent five years in British ArmyFoster condemns UVF #show of strength# after masked men patrol Belfast streetsNI teen who wouldn#t stop singingFields of Athenry to police fined £ and told to learn whole songNI traffic alerts: Motorist trapped in car after floodingLatest Northern IrelandEdwin Poots feeling well after undergoing cancer surgeryOur family will not stop in our fight for justice, vows daughter of murdered Danny McCleanShots fired at Coleraine housePolice probe storm drain where teenager Noah Donohoe discoveredPermanent solutions needed to NI Protocol to ensure unfettered access: DUPLatest from Belfast The NHS and care workers who have died during the coronavirus pandemicCarlo Ancelotti impressed with Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s defensive dutiesRussell Crowe sends birthday message to British sailor on round-the-world tripEdwin Poots feeling well after undergoing cancer surgeryLeaders Manchester City pull clear while Liverpool lose at Anfield once again,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The boat, named Day Dawn N , ran ashore on August  last year and has remained anchored to the spot ever since. The retired fishing vessel had been acquired by Nathan Ross and Druso Martinez de Riquelme with a view to mooring it at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as an Air B ‘n’ B. However, after running into dficulty last August, those plans have been put on hold. It was initially suspected that the tide was too low to refloat the boat. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners later revealed that the bigger issue was the fact that it’s suspended over a three and a half metre crater in the mudflats. In late November, the stars seemed to align to the sailors’ delight a high tide arrived and they secured the services of marine specialists to dig a channel under the boat in order to move it to a nearby marina. The drones were out to capture the moment Day Dawn made it back to sea. Unfortunately, their efforts proved unfruitful and, according to the owners, the operation cost a substantial sum of money. There has been little to no activity around the boat since the start of this year. googletag.cmd.push The Derry News asked Foyle Portthere will come a time when it may have to intervene orit’s possible the boat could become a permanent fixture on the River Foyle landscape. In response, a spokesperson said: “The responsibility for the movement of the boat remains firmly with the owners and we would encourage them to continue to do all they can to have the vessel re-floated. “This is an unfortunate situation that they have created and now must make every effort to employ further resources to deal with this problem. “We continue to monitor the location to ensure that the vessel poses no threat to the main navigation channel, nor that it is causing any unnecessary impact to the local environment.”     The boat owners were contacted for comment but none was provided at the time of publishing.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The mural at Great James Street was created by local company UV Arts. Ahead of the broadcast of the new ITV programme Home Sweet Home, which will feature Derry in an episode airing on Tuesday, February , it has been revealed that the mural was suggested by Joanna Lumley, the show’s presenter. Ms Lumley visited Derry in  to take part in a conference marking the th anniversary of Children in Crossfire, the charity set up by Mr Moore. She ed last autumn to film for the series in which she visits places special to her. googletag.cmd.push Ms Lumley said: “In Derry we wanted to film the historic murals, The Derry Girls and my friend Richard Moore, the ‘Derry Lama’, as the Dalai Lama calls him. “It suddenly seemed that we could link these three stories together by art: the ravishing mural Saoirse-Monica showed me of the Derry Girls led us easily to Karl, whose team is creating such important new art work in this fabulous city. “Would it be possible to celebrate the le-affirming achievements of the man the Dalai Lama calls ‘My hero’ in a mural  “The finished work is utterly magnicent, and I am proud that I was allowed to spray a tiny bit of it under Karl’s watchful eye. Part of me will always remain in Derry, a city I love with all my heart.” googletag.cmd.push  Mr Moore said: “When Joanna told me towards the end of our recording that we had one more stop to make, I could not have ever imagined what I was about to be shown. “I am so honoured and humbled at this wonderfully generous gesture. Joanna has been a good friend to me and a great supporter of Children in Crossfire, both of which mean a great deal to me. “She has also built a great rapport with Derry and many of its people, and I look forward to tuning in to Home Sweet Home to see our city at its best.     “I am also grateful to Karl Porter from UV Arts for his vision and genuine passion for this project”. Karl Porter from UV Arts, the creative arts team behind a whole host of public artworks in the city and the artist who painted the mural, said: “Its not everyday you get to paint a mural with Joanna Lumley, who is apparently very afraid of heights and I was told she will not get on the lt, but she did! “ “Joanna helped me direct the cherry picker and also painted one of the most important parts of the mural - the connection, the area where The Dalai Lama and Richard Moore touched. “I think the symbolism of this helps strengthen the relationship and the meaning behind the mural. “The mural depicts a Buddhist blessing, a signicant moment between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Richard Moore. “The Unalome symbol rising from that connection is the Buddhist symbol representing the path to enlightenment. “Our journey in le is never perfect, never straight or even in the right direction but a journey nonetheless, full of lessons and experiences. Something that Richard has lived experience of, having overcome such a powerful injury to lead a wholesome and selfless le dedicated to others.” Karl said that when first approached about the project he was delighted to have the chance to celebrate one of Derrys greatest living heroes. “The chance to create our own connections led us to collaborate with Belfast based artist and illustrator Conor McClure and together create this powerful piece of art. “If you look closely, the shape of the heads and the Dalai Lamas embrace - forms the shape of a heart, a simple yet subtle way to celebrate the connections between these two iniduals. “It was a great privilege for me to be asked to produce this new mural. The image we have used is iconic, showing the Dalai Lama’s deep spirituality as well as his admiration for Richard Moore. I hope it will attract locals and visitors alike for many years to come and a poignant new addition to our street art movement in the city.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Causeway Coast and Glens was the most politically active of the local government districts, with .% of its respondents party members and .% having attended a protest or rally. Asked to comment on issues in local politics they felt were important, a number of respondents expressed concern with sectarianism in the decision making process. “Our local councillors and mla’s work hard for their local areas daily resolving local issues,” said one respondent. “Our MP is non-existent, our council is out of touch, but those voting against some things do not rely on votes in thar area. An undercurrent of bigotry exists in decision making.” “We need less green  orange politics and need to start seeing what we have in common. In NI these dferences are minimal when it comes down to the important issues,” added another.  One respondent simply said it was time to end the sectarian diatribes. Another person surveyed felt the boundaries of the local councils needed looked at again. “Limavady should be part of Derry  Strabane Council as it is with health. Coleraine ignores us once they have our vote,” they said. Another respondent criticised local politicians for a perceived lack of ambition. “I feel local reps are usually very responsive to very local need and cases,” they said. “I do however think there at times is a lack of vision and too much of the there are far bigger issues type of response to positive ideas. “A poverty of ambitions only creates greater issues down the line. I think Derry needs to be far more proactive to issues that will arise rather than just reactive to the problems we already face.” Councillor Kathleen McGurk told the County Derry Post the proximity of councillors to their areas could be behind the greater indications of confidence. “A lot of people know their local councillors personally, or know of them. A lot of the issues we get sent our way are things that impact peoples day-to-day lives,” she said. “If you broke it down to how close your MP lives to you, those that live closer to their MP would probably have a lot of trust in them, whereas those that maybe live at the other end of the constituency might not know them from Adam.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Caoimhe Murtagh, a pupil at St Brigids PS, Mayogall, is once again putting Mayogall on the map by appearing as an extra in the drama, which was filmed in Northern Ireland. This is not Caoimhes first TV appearance. The -year-old, who is signed up to the Extras NI agency, has appeared in Mrs Wilson and Mothers Day, alongside Vicky McLure of This is England and Line of Duty fame. Caoimhes mum Colleen says she initially signed her up to build confidence and gain experience.  Caoimhe has that wee something in her, she told Derry Now. googletag.cmd.push She likes the modelling and the dancing and shed like to do a bit of acting in the future.The very first time she went into nursery I remember her singing the Frozen songs, so shes not shy. She had two parts in Marcella. One was in the background where you could vaguely see her and the other one is about four seconds of just her in the shot. She is dancing up and down excited to see herself and tell family and friends and has loved every minute of it. Colleen believes Caoimhes distinctive red hair has been an advantage and has helped her stand out when she has been chosen for parts. googletag.cmd.push Shes easily spotted because of the red hair, shes very distinctive, she said. The red hair was maybe historically a bully tactic, but everybody loves her hair because she is so proud of it. Episode , Series  of Marcella will air tonight on ITV at .pm, butyou cant wait until then, you can follow the lead of Caoimhe and her mum and binge the whole thing beforehand. Weve already seen it on ITV Hub – we couldnt wait to watch it! added Colleen.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old, who helped raised more than poundmillion for the health service last year through a fundraising walk around his garden, died earlier today after contracting Covid-. The Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor Brian Tierney, has expressed his sadness at the news. Adding his voice to the many who offered their sympathies to Captain Toms family today, Mayor Tierney said he had achieved a remarkable thing when he lted the spirits of the world with his kindness. googletag.cmd.push I was deeply saddened today to hear such tragic news, particularly as Captain Tom did so much to raise awareness of Covid and the pressures on the health service. His simple gesture of determination and kindness captured the imagination of everyone and inspired and united people in the fight against this terrible virus. Sadly, he has joined the many thousands who have so tragically been stolen from us. Captain Sir Tom Moore will always be remembered as a beacon of hope in the darkest of times, and an example to us all. I think it is only right that local people should have the opportunity to send their personal condolences and thanks to Captain Toms family, so I will open an online Book of Condolence tomorrow. googletag.cmd.push I think thathe is to have any lasting legacy it should be in the actions of every one of us as we protect those around us from the harshest effects of this virus. Please let us all remember Captain Tom, and in his memory always put the safety of others first and foremost in our thoughts. Further details will follow tomorrow on the Book of Condolence, which will be available on the Councils website atderrystrabane      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Will it be a long slow recovery or a rapid bounce back to the economy we had in February   I believe there will be a rapid recovery, mainly due to the fact that weve sunk to such a low base. By April , UK GDP had fallen % in two months. They did recover as the lockdowns ended but the Bank of Englandhave forecast a UK GDP growth of -% in  and a +% in . A decline like the Covid dip hasnt been seen since World War Two. googletag.cmd.push The good news, however, is the pace of recovery and most economists predict it will be rapid. Its with this rapid recovery in mind that Im focused on how Derry can benefit. Its fair to say people in Derry are fed up with the constant battle to take Derry to the next level. We look enviously at cities like Galway, Limerick, Cork and Belfast and ask why are they doing so well  Galway, which is half the size of Derry, has , students at the National University of Ireland Galway compared with , at Magee CollegeDerry. In , Galway attracted the second highest number of overseas visitors to Ireland, beating the much larger cities of Cork and Limerick. They even beat the world famous Kerry. googletag.cmd.push Galwayattracted .m tourists who spent €bn in the county or city.  Derry on the other hand reported a tourism spend of poundm in  which was up from poundm in . These figures were presented to the Derry City  Strabane District Council by Visit Derry on September . They also were keen to add that by  they expected income from tourism to reach poundm. It made a great headline but when you actually let it sink in and compare it to Galway, its pathetic. Even forgetting the fact that the Galway figure is two years older, we basically generate less than % of what Galway generates in tourism revenue.     If Derry was part of the Republic of Ireland, we would be around th in the Failte Ireland published list, comparing with the likes of Louth and Cavan. Remember folks we are the fth biggest city in Ireland and the only Walled City on the island. We shouldnt be languishing in th place. I compare ONLY these two statistics to highlight the complete inequality that exists. If Derry had , students for example and you agree with the research done by Experian who in , which indicated that a student spend is over pound, a yearthen that immediately adds poundm spend into the local economy. This drives jobs and prosperity. If we attracted % of the tourists Galway gets, we would pull in approximately poundm, compared to the poundm. These two wins for Derry would transform Derry and put pound-m more into the local economy annually. I havent even considered the Foreign Direct Investment numbers or infrastructure support Galway gets because I wanted to demonstrate just how investment in further educationand tourism could transform Derry. So how do we solve this problem  The first thing we need to do is get to the heart of Government in NI and convince them there is a complete regional imbalance. We need them to admit there is actually institutionalised bias towards many places in NI including Derry. This wont be easy but the recent narrative on balancing up does offer some hope. There also seems a drive within the New Decade New Approach to do things dferently and perhaps we could see more of our money being spent to correct  years of economic imbalance. It is a lot to ask for but at least the language is changing. The other thing we need to do is articulate our case better. Often what is dismissed as Derry crying is in actual fact public representatives trying to do the job they were elected to do. Clearly a lot of positive things are happening in the city. The A road in well on track and we also got a new Transport Hub in the Waterside. Ebrington is flying with the potential for thousands of new jobs onsite, however all of this barely scratches the surface of the huge problems Derry has. I want my public representatives to fight for Derry and challenge when we dont get our fair share. I want them to not only compare how we get short changed but also to put clear coated proposals forward for how we redress the imbalance. Its only by putting forward new ideas and plans that we will break the cycle. A recently launched document given to me by Martina Anderson MLA really caught my eye. Titled Tackling Regional Inequality, it goes to the heart of the problem. Not only does it summarise the huge levels of inequality that exist in Derry but it also offers some very workable solutions. I believe current policies are not working for Derry so we have to challenge the normal way of doing this and change it up. This document does this in a few key areas. A few of the key actions that I particularly liked were: . Transforming Invest NI: The document argues that Invest NI needs mandated to channel support away from Belfast and more to areas where it is required. This is in line with the Executives commitment to Tackling Regional Inequalities. Its a brave move but the right move. It also wants a transformation of the roles and s of Invest NI. . Establishment of a Job Steering Unit in Councils:Councils should definitely work more on this area. I believe they should be definitely tallying the numbers of new jobs being created in their region and where it is falling short taking the appropriate action. I also agree they should have more of a role in FDI message and targeting. . Supporting the North West as an Economic Region:I agree fully with this. Derry Donegal is a much easier sell for FDI. Its crazy that businesses in each side of the border have dferent levels of support. We need to work together and grow together. The Irish Government should be a willing partner. . Department of Communities and Economy should establish an employability programme for long term unemployed .This worked well before and should be rolled out again. People are our greatest asset and getting people into meaningful employment should be everyones goal.   Directing Employment through Public Sector Interventions:I am a huge fan of this initiative. The NI Executive spends poundbn a year and capturing a fraction of this for the Social Economy sector is not only good business but improves community cohesion. Putting social clauses into Public Sector contracts and ensuring that winning tenders must demonstrate a positive social value impact is a fantastic idea. Covid has seen communities pull together. Quite often contracts are awarded solely on price with no acknowledgement given to the social capital a company expends. In a post-Covid world, we need to support organisations who deliver quality services at a competitive price but also who provide huge amounts of social impact. The document is fresh and rather than bash government it offers a way forward with many innovative ideas. The Buy Social element is already being implemented so lets watch this space and hopefully it will create more local jobs and community cohesion. In closing, tackling regional inequality is perhaps the biggest thing we can do to reposition Derry as a thriving well connected University City attracting loads of FDI. Galway should be our benchmark in a lot of the areas where we are failing and we shouldnt be afraid to set the bar higher. We have a fantastic product and the problem is we have been starved of the resources we need to make the change happen. With the Executive clearly stating that tackling regional inequality is now a key policy change we need to increase our challengetenfold. The ‘Tackling Regional Inequalities’ document is a really good document with many simple ways of doing this. I suggest you read it and support many of the aims. I hope its the first of many published by local political parties or stakeholders offering ways forward for Derry. Just saying things are broken, doesnt fix them. We need well costed articulated plans.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Will it be a long slow recovery or a rapid bounce back to the economy we had in February   I believe there will be a rapid recovery, mainly due to the fact that weve sunk to such a low base. By April , UK GDP had fallen % in two months. They did recover as the lockdowns ended but the Bank of Englandhave forecast a UK GDP growth of -% in  and a +% in . A decline like the Covid dip hasnt been seen since World War Two. googletag.cmd.push The good news, however, is the pace of recovery and most economists predict it will be rapid. Its with this rapid recovery in mind that Im focused on how Derry can benefit. Its fair to say people in Derry are fed up with the constant battle to take Derry to the next level. We look enviously at cities like Galway, Limerick, Cork and Belfast and ask why are they doing so well  Galway, which is half the size of Derry, has , students at the National University of Ireland Galway compared with , at Magee CollegeDerry. In , Galway attracted the second highest number of overseas visitors to Ireland, beating the much larger cities of Cork and Limerick. They even beat the world famous Kerry. googletag.cmd.push Galwayattracted .m tourists who spent €bn in the county or city.  Derry on the other hand reported a tourism spend of poundm in  which was up from poundm in . These figures were presented to the Derry City  Strabane District Council by Visit Derry on September . They also were keen to add that by  they expected income from tourism to reach poundm. It made a great headline but when you actually let it sink in and compare it to Galway, its pathetic. Even forgetting the fact that the Galway figure is two years older, we basically generate less than % of what Galway generates in tourism revenue.     If Derry was part of the Republic of Ireland, we would be around th in the Failte Ireland published list, comparing with the likes of Louth and Cavan. Remember folks we are the fth biggest city in Ireland and the only Walled City on the island. We shouldnt be languishing in th place. I compare ONLY these two statistics to highlight the complete inequality that exists. If Derry had , students for example and you agree with the research done by Experian who in , which indicated that a student spend is over pound, a yearthen that immediately adds poundm spend into the local economy. This drives jobs and prosperity. If we attracted % of the tourists Galway gets, we would pull in approximately poundm, compared to the poundm. These two wins for Derry would transform Derry and put pound-m more into the local economy annually. I havent even considered the Foreign Direct Investment numbers or infrastructure support Galway gets because I wanted to demonstrate just how investment in further educationand tourism could transform Derry. So how do we solve this problem  The first thing we need to do is get to the heart of Government in NI and convince them there is a complete regional imbalance. We need them to admit there is actually institutionalised bias towards many places in NI including Derry. This wont be easy but the recent narrative on balancing up does offer some hope. There also seems a drive within the New Decade New Approach to do things dferently and perhaps we could see more of our money being spent to correct  years of economic imbalance. It is a lot to ask for but at least the language is changing. The other thing we need to do is articulate our case better. Often what is dismissed as Derry crying is in actual fact public representatives trying to do the job they were elected to do. Clearly a lot of positive things are happening in the city. The A road in well on track and we also got a new Transport Hub in the Waterside. Ebrington is flying with the potential for thousands of new jobs onsite, however all of this barely scratches the surface of the huge problems Derry has. I want my public representatives to fight for Derry and challenge when we dont get our fair share. I want them to not only compare how we get short changed but also to put clear coated proposals forward for how we redress the imbalance. Its only by putting forward new ideas and plans that we will break the cycle. A recently launched document given to me by Martina Anderson MLA really caught my eye. Titled Tackling Regional Inequality, it goes to the heart of the problem. Not only does it summarise the huge levels of inequality that exist in Derry but it also offers some very workable solutions. I believe current policies are not working for Derry so we have to challenge the normal way of doing this and change it up. This document does this in a few key areas. A few of the key actions that I particularly liked were: . Transforming Invest NI: The document argues that Invest NI needs mandated to channel support away from Belfast and more to areas where it is required. This is in line with the Executives commitment to Tackling Regional Inequalities. Its a brave move but the right move. It also wants a transformation of the roles and s of Invest NI. . Establishment of a Job Steering Unit in Councils:Councils should definitely work more on this area. I believe they should be definitely tallying the numbers of new jobs being created in their region and where it is falling short taking the appropriate action. I also agree they should have more of a role in FDI message and targeting. . Supporting the North West as an Economic Region:I agree fully with this. Derry Donegal is a much easier sell for FDI. Its crazy that businesses in each side of the border have dferent levels of support. We need to work together and grow together. The Irish Government should be a willing partner. . Department of Communities and Economy should establish an employability programme for long term unemployed .This worked well before and should be rolled out again. People are our greatest asset and getting people into meaningful employment should be everyones goal.   Directing Employment through Public Sector Interventions:I am a huge fan of this initiative. The NI Executive spends poundbn a year and capturing a fraction of this for the Social Economy sector is not only good business but improves community cohesion. Putting social clauses into Public Sector contracts and ensuring that winning tenders must demonstrate a positive social value impact is a fantastic idea. Covid has seen communities pull together. Quite often contracts are awarded solely on price with no acknowledgement given to the social capital a company expends. In a post-Covid world, we need to support organisations who deliver quality services at a competitive price but also who provide huge amounts of social impact. The document is fresh and rather than bash government it offers a way forward with many innovative ideas. The Buy Social element is already being implemented so lets watch this space and hopefully it will create more local jobs and community cohesion. In closing, tackling regional inequality is perhaps the biggest thing we can do to reposition Derry as a thriving well connected University City attracting loads of FDI. Galway should be our benchmark in a lot of the areas where we are failing and we shouldnt be afraid to set the bar higher. We have a fantastic product and the problem is we have been starved of the resources we need to make the change happen. With the Executive clearly stating that tackling regional inequality is now a key policy change we need to increase our challengetenfold. The ‘Tackling Regional Inequalities’ document is a really good document with many simple ways of doing this. I suggest you read it and support many of the aims. I hope its the first of many published by local political parties or stakeholders offering ways forward for Derry. Just saying things are broken, doesnt fix them. We need well costed articulated plans.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The proposed investment at the Ballyronan Road site in the town will see the existing recycling centre completely upgraded, to include a new split level design for visitors, while the portion of the site used to house the Council’s refuse collection fleet and to manage the transfer of waste, will also benefit from extensive modernisation. Almost poundK has been secured for the scheme through theDepartment of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs’Household Waste Recycling Collaborative Change Programme, with the remainder funded by the Council. googletag.cmd.push Chair of Mid Ulster District Council’s Planning Committee, Councillor Sean McPeake, welcomed the approval. “Planning has a key role to play in protecting and enhancing bioersity, geo-ersity and the environment, he said. This signicant investment will see a bespoke state of the art recycling centre and transfer facility created, which will result in an increase in both the quantity and quality of recyclable materials collected on site, allowing more effective collection and disposal of waste, and a continued focus on the ersion of waste from landfill.” Environment Minister Gordon Lyons MLA said: “Under my Department’s Household Waste Collaborative Change Programme up to pound million is being invested into making recycling easier and to improve the quality and quantity of material being recycled. googletag.cmd.push “I am pleased to announce that funding of some pound, has been awarded to Mid Ulster District Council to redevelop the Magherafelt Household Recycling Centre.

The scheme is part of an overall pound.M investment in leisure and outdoor recreation facilities across the district by the Council. Work continues at the site to complete the underlying ground works for the new G pitch before the specialist surface is laid. A visible transformation has already taken place on the site of the former police station adjacent to the existing leisure centre, with the removal of the boundary walls and opening up of the site. googletag.cmd.push Funding for this project was approved through Mid Ulster Rural Development Partnership under its Village Renewal Scheme, part-funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme  –  by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, and the European Union, with the remainder of the investment from Mid Ulster District Council. Chair of the Council’s Planning Committee, Councillor Seacutean McPeake, said the timing of the approval was important. “From a planning perspective, this decision illustrates how planning has such a vital role in supporting the vision of our Community Plan to create a region which is a welcoming place, where our people are content, healthy and safe, he said. googletag.cmd.push This focus has never been more important than now, when taking care of our health and well-being has come to the fore for each and every one of us.” Chair of Mid Ulster Rural Development Partnership, Conor Corr said the development would have a signicant impact. “This is one of a number of strategic projects supported under the Partnership’s Village Renewal Scheme, he said. Having provided % of the funding from our enhanced budget of pound.m of EU LEADER funding for village renewal projects, this scheme will also have signicant local impact by addressing some of the key issues identied by those who live in Maghera.     Having that local input and consultation has been a key factor in making projects such as this both successful and sustainable”. Extended car parking, landscaping, a new trim trail and an all-inclusive play area will complete the project when works finish in the spring and it is hoped that access to the pitch will be made available following the lting of current Covid- restrictions.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Life.jpg","title":"A life in football well worth it for Andy  ","story":"ANDREW Waterworth has made his mark as one of the best Irish League strikers of his generation.Having started at Kilmore Rec, the  year-old Crossgar hit-man went on to get a taste of the full-time game with a move in  to Hamiliton in the Scottish Premiership after signing from Lisburn Distillery in a pound, deal.Following hishome he joined Glentoran, claiming Irish Cup and Irish Premiership titles during a five-year spell which ended in  when he made the switch to the Glensrsquo great rivals Linfield where he has enjoyed eight trophy-laden years.The Recorder caught up Waterworth to chat about his career, his work away from Linfield, and his hopes and ambitions for his post-playing days.CB: How have you been keeping during lockdown Andrew AW: It has been very strange. I suppose with the first lockdown, things were definitely easier. It was spring, coming into summer, we all had the good weather and there was a novelty to it really. Now though, it has been slightly tougher. But listen, overall I canrsquot complain at all. Irsquom still in training, working in football too, so I am very lucky I have that.CB: How did you find things at the start of lockdown because there did appear to be some ambiguity as to whether the Irish League players could be classed as elite athletes and continue playing  That must have been confusing and unsettling AW: It was a strange one no doubt. Certainly everyone involved in the Irish League, especially at Premiership level, strives to be elite. A lot of us are full-time. I have certainly no problem with the extra training that comes with that and the extra work.But the players do need to be subject to regular testing for Covid-. It is counter-productive to what we, as a society, are trying to do in terms of curtailing this disease otherwise.There has been a lot of ambiguity, but certainly I havenrsquot encountered a player who didnrsquot want to be playing. But obviously we are all concerned that we are able to do so in as safe a manner as possible.At the end of the day, after a match or a training session, we are all going back to loved ones and people who may be vulnerable too. We want to ensure they are as protected as possible.CB: In terms of your role and your standing now at Linfield, you would be considered to be one of the veterans of the side, but you still seem as hungry as ever for goals and success.AW: Absolutely, and in many ways you know that has been the case even more since the first lockdown. At that stage I had so much on with my work with the Irish FA, I probably didnrsquot have the time I would have liked to have dedicated to my own football.But certainly you can see the dference it makes to your season and your ability to hit the ground runningyou do get that good pre-season base in.I was doing my own fitness work in the house during the lockdown.I embrace where I am at now in my career and my age. But I am fortunate in that sense. I know a lot of people who get to my stage and they basically dread retirement. I am  now, so I suppose you do think about when retirement will come.Over the past while, as one of the more senior players at Linfield, I have been able to take on more, I suppose, of that advisory role to younger players. You know those younger guys coming to me asking me about fitness programmes, looking for advice about clubs and things like that, it is great.I am still, believe it or not, learning about the game. I am adapting my role on the pitch too as I move into this latter phase of my playing career. Sometimes you have to do that.But I am going back to foundations and in many ways that has really helped my form this season.Things like learning about playing more with your back to goal, how to use that to your advantage. It is something I have really enjoyed and as I say, embraced.CB: You have played under many of the top managers in the Irish League during your time. David Healy, another local figure at the club like yourself, obviously went into the Linfield job very much managerially as a rookie, although having of course achieved so much as a player. How would you rate him as a manager and indeed how he has made that switch from the pitch to the dugout AW: David I know, never really foresaw becoming a manager. He would tell you that himself. What I do notice about him is, despite everything he achieved, he never talks about his playing days. He is a huge Linfield supporter and he is results-driven. Make no mistake though, he rules with an iron fist.He expects very high standards. It is the job of the players who are there to win. Thatrsquos it, no excuses. Dferent managers bring dferent attributes to any job. But certainly with David,you fall below his standard, you will know.With playing under the like of David Jeffrey, he is a very dferent case. He loved to create that whole ethos of lsquoeverbody hates Linfieldrsquo, and I guess tap into that siege mentality side of things.DJ I suppose, would have been a bit more touchy-feely with the players than perhaps David Healy. Jeffrey would have brought the players to the side, and had the little one-to-one man management conversations with them.But I will say working with David [Healy], especially as he himself was a striker, has taken my game to a whole dferent level since I have been working with him. There is never a comfort zone at Linfield mdash that is the big thing. That has been a key part of my longevity I believe. You constantly have to be kicking on at Linfield. Anyone who coasts at Linfield, they donrsquot last long.CB: Casting your mind back to your days with Kilmore Rec, how much do you think the Amateur League and Kilmore helped you in terms of being ready for the steps up you made AW: Thatrsquos a really good question. The Amateur League is a brilliant springboard for then moving on to the Irish League. You play real first team football. As a player, you can sometimes spend too long at bigger clubsrsquo academies.I had been at the Glentoran academy for a while before I went back to Kilmore for first team football. I was lucky at that time with the Kilmore first team that was there. I played with boys like Gary Curran, Paul Smyth, Joe McMahon.They were players who wanted to win so badly, they played fair, but they played hard. I went into Duck [Donal] Bellrsquos team just as the club were going on a great Irish Cup run that season. That gave me a complete love for the game.But I quickly got to the stage where I didnrsquot just want to do two days a week with my football. Donrsquot get me wrong, the Amateur League, Premier Section is a good standard. As a footballing family, there is a lot for us to be proud of with the Amateur League.Obviously at the moment, all the clubs at that standard are in such a dficult place, but a good club at that level serves a purpose in so many ways, especially for the community. For clubs like Kilmore, and indeed all those playing at that level, it is a real tragedy that there is no football being played at the moment.CB: You are also heavily involved in the coaching side of things with your work with the IFA. Is coaching something you think you might be interested in post-playing, and indeed do you want to remain in football when you hang the boots up AW: I am definitely at the stage now I suppose where I am asking myself how can I remain in the game. It is without doubt something I want to do, to stay in football. But it is about working out exactly in what role that would be best for me.I suppose I have been able to work on a bit of a niche thing for myself with the Irish FA with a coaching and education role. I have done a bit of work with Gerard Lyttle with the Northern Ireland under-age teams and that has been something I have really enjoyed. It is great to see the progress of the younger boys through the dferent age levels with Northern Ireland.CB: You made the move for a time to Hamilton and were up against the top teams in Scotland. How was playing over there for you AW: It is funny you ask about that. My uncle only last night was asking me about all that is happening with Celtic at the moment. When I was there in Scotland you had boys like James McCarthy, Leigh Grfiths, James Forrest all up-and-coming and you could tell easily at that stage that they were boys who were going places. It is definitely a better standard of football in Scotland than a of people realise. I remember when I moved to Hamilton from Lisburn Distillery, I had played for Distillery on the Tuesday night, and then the move to Hamilton picked up momentum quickly.All of a sudden, come the Sunday of that week, there I was playing for Hamilton at Aberdeen in a Scottish Cup game in front of , people. I have to be honest, maybe I was a bit young at the time, maybe the home sickness got the better of me, but I do regret that I came home from Scotland again so soon.I have regretted it every day. You donrsquot want to let the like of that eat away at you, but I was there. I was rubbing shoulders with the gamersquos best.If I could go back and relive that experience again, I would do it in a heartbeat. But you donrsquot want to dwell on it, otherwise it could destroy you.I trained as hard as anyone over there. Maybe I would say compared to others at that standard, I struggled technically. You can get so down on yourself but when you are younger. For me, the chance came too early.It was the last day of the January transfer window when I made the move to Scotland. It actually looked for a long time that Irsquod be going to Aberdeen. However, that fell through at the last minute. I went to Hamilton then, but unfortunately it was just the wrong club for me.I did have chances again to go across the water. When Warren Feeney got the Newport job, he wanted me to go across there, but it wasnrsquot right for me. Everyone has a dferent journey. I was a late developer.Football is a tough place. People watch the Premier League and think that is what it is all about, but in many ways that is not the real picture of what football is, the glamour that is seemingly there. It is so tough to crack the code across the water.It is especially dficult for an Irish kid. If it is an English kid at an English club or a Scottish youngster at a Scottish club, they can easily go back and forth to their family, and alleviate that home-sickness.You canrsquot have thatyou are an Irish kid over there as easily. It can be lonely at times, and it is tough there is no doubt.CB: When you look at Scottish football this season, and particularly in the Premiership for Celtic and Rangers, there has been a complete transformation in fortunes and that in the season when Celtic have been chasing that historic ten-in-a-row. Has the role-reversal between the two Glasgow sides surprised you AW: There is no doubt, the change has been really drastic. I never imagined, despite how much Steven Gerrard has improved Rangers that the gap would be this big, particularly this early in the season.I know Michael Beale, a coach at Rangers from working at the IFA. He is a methodical coach, leaves nothing to chance, and I have no doubt he will have had a big role on the success Rangers are enjoying on the pitch at the moment. Gerrard has done a great job of getting that Rangers back four shored up.But things go wrong. For Celtic, I have no doubt they have found it dficult playing without fans.They definitely feed off the atmosphere that is usually generated by the supporters at Celtic Park.And the Dubai trip has been a really unwanted distraction that has not helped them at all.I do believe however for Celtic it can be a quick turn-around. I donrsquot necessarily see that they will now have to wait years for another Scottish title, the way in which it has been so long since Rangers last won it.Celtic can dust themselves down. Football can be so fluid. That is one of the great things about it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch named Irish club of the year by writers  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH RFC have been voted as the best rugby club in Ireland.The club was named Club of the Year by the Guinness Rugby Writers of Ireland Club of the Year.The club won the accolade for its outstanding community outreach work during the Covid- lockdown.This community spirit, said the Rugby writers, was nurtured from mini rugby players through to the seniors.Club chairman James Kirk said everyone at the club was delighted with the award.We are obviously very pleased.

It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it.ldquoWersquove noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.Just one hour every year for the past four decades has made the RSPBrsquos big garden birdwatch the worldrsquos largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted.Last yearrsquos results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the big garden birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens.Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  mdash house sparrows followed by starlings mdashstarlings were the most-spotted birds in Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry, ahead of house sparrows, while Fermanaghrsquos number one bird was the chaffinch.The Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world and while house sparrows and starlings may be the UKrsquos most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at the data shows that numbers have ped dramatically since the birdwatch began in .House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %.Itrsquos also a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.To sign up for the for the big garden birdwatch visit www.rspb.org.uk birdwatch while to learn more about RSPB NIrsquos work log on at www.rspb.org.uk nireland  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit trading with Great Britain ‘complete nightmare’%2C says owner  ","story":"THE impact of Brexit and the Irish Sea border is impacting on one of the districtrsquos most popular garden centres.Beth Lunney mdash who runs the Saintfield Nursery Centre along with her family mdash has described the impact of the most signicant change to trading in decades and one that will affect many businesses.She said changes became apparent in November, just weeks before the UK formally left the EU.As part of the garden centrersquos preparations for the new sea border it, had signed up to the governmentrsquos Trader Support Service, with Beth also liaising with her suppliers in England.Her longstanding supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons got in touch and revealed that he was not going to be able to get the delivery to Saintfield, explaining that it was because of the possibility that there could be soil in the pots.The UK supplier had correctly interpreted the new rules which apply on trade in plants between Great Britain and Northern Ireland which is still in the EUrsquos plant health system and therefore must apply EU rules on products entering from Great Britain.Plants now need a plant health certicate to enter the country, but some products are completely banned, including soil as it can carry pests and diseases, but there maybe even more problems ahead.Beth said it was being suggested in some quarters that there may be an issue with pallets and even wooden handled forks and spades coming into Northern Ireland due to Brexit and the Irish Sea border and even delays in getting wooden furniture which she currently has on order.In the wake of Bethrsquos UK supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons getting in touch, her rose supplier subsequently got in contact via email to confirm that he would not be able to supply roses which had been on order since the autumn for planned deliveries throughout the season.ldquoThe problem is the peat reduced compost they use along with wood fibre and bark to pot up the roses, Beth explained, expressing sympathy for her suppliers.ldquoThe growers in GB are in a terrible position. They cannot take a chance and send plants to us as they may be delayed at our new border. A plant, like food, is perishable and a delivery could be taken and destroyed. Who will be willing to take that chance  I guess no one.Beth said Northern Ireland has the same climate as the rest of Great Britain and plants that do well there will also do well here, explaining that the local nursery is more selective about taking plants from Europe.She said the new regulations were not just a challenge for Saintfield Nurseries, but the entire Northern Ireland horticultural industry.The new reality for some businesses is that it has become easier to get key supplies from the EU, with Beth explaining that she already gets part of her stock from the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland and that this may have to increase.She said that several nurseries in the Republic of Ireland are emailing the Saintfield business saying theyrsquore going to have roses, but they may not be the particular ieties that they really want.Beth added: ldquoWe were told we would leave the EU as one country, the UK. We have been badly let down by all those that govern us. We should be equal to Scotland, Wales and England all of us members of the United Kingdom, but sadly now this is not the case.ldquoOne of my suppliers in England who contacted me last Friday thought there would be no problem supplying us but now the whole Northern Ireland and Brexit issue is a complete nightmare.The Horticultural Trades Associationis also lobbying the government, urging it to work with the EU to explore ways to ease the new rules.ldquoThe impact of these complex and burdensome changes is far-reaching for GB and NI, said the organisationrsquos chairman James Barnes, warning that the UKrsquos horticulture industry stands to lose outsolutions cannot be found..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Centennial.jpg","title":"Centennial celebrations event by Spa Wells LOL  ","story":"MEMBERS of Spa Wells LOL  kicked off their year long celebrations of the Centennial of Northern Ireland with a hike up Slieve Croob on New Yearrsquos Day.Crisp clear weather afforded enchanting views stretching to neighbouring Scotland and England.A poem was written to commemorate the occasion.On Slieve Croobrsquos lofty mountain peak:We placed our flag todayTo give a message to the worldThat we are here to stayOne hundred years have come and goneOur motto is the sameThe Union is our safeguardAnd this we will maintain.The members plan more exciting and interestingprojects throughout the year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Student.jpg","title":"Cormac secures place at prestigious Harvard University  ","story":"A TEENAGER will be swapping Downpatrick for Hard University later this year.Cormac Savage is the first pupil from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School to be offered a place at the world famous American university.Seventeen year-old Cormac, who is head boy at St Patrickrsquos, says itrsquos a dream come true to be given an opportunity to study at what is regarded as one of the top universities in the world.Hersquos also grateful to his family and the teachers at St Patrickrsquos, including the principal, Mr Joe McCann, for encouraging him to apply in the first place.Hard is one of the fabled lsquoIvy Leaguersquo universities in the United States and Cormac was one of , students to apply for a place, of which only seven per cent were successful.ldquoWhile Irsquod always wanted to study in the USA, it wasnrsquot until a year ago I seriously considered Hard, he said.ldquoIt was always my dream university but I was convinced I wouldnrsquot get in.

I have made up my mind to go abroad to work and I think a lot of other students will do that as well.The Nursing and Midwery Council , the registration body for nurses, recently extended its Emergency Standards to allow final year nursing students to undertake paid clinical placements in order to support the existing nursing workforce during the pandemic.While this has been introduced in England, Scotland and Wales, Robin Swann has declined to implement them into Northern Ireland.In early December, the Department of Health said a joint statement from the NMC and UK chief nursing officers explained that students would not be put into paid placements, as happened earlier during the pandemic.The statement said that instead, employing health trusts would protect their status as supernumerary students and continue to support them through high quality placements, which is a fundamental aspect of pre-registration nurse training.South Down MP Chris Hazzard is supporting the call from Eimear and other final year nursing students.He added: ldquoThese nurses are working at the front line and saving lives.

However, as many will recall, for some years he ran Northern Irelandrsquos only table tennis shop in Irish Street, Downpatrick. He had a steady line of customers from near and far who came to make their purchases.As all local players will of course know, Jim is the local man to go to for advice on what rubber suits inidual players.As one who has made use of his help and advice on many occasions, it is quite common to arrive in Strangford to play a match, or indeed in another local hall, and find Jim replacing rubbers.He has also given people from ious local halls advice and has moved many on to pimpled rubbers in recent years, saving them money. A good many seasons back, Jim, anxious to give some of the Strangford clubrsquos younger players a bit of extra publicity, wrote reports for the Down Recorder.As a close associate to the long-time secretary of the Lecale League, Pat Morgan, there was never any doubt who would replace Pat when he sadly passed away.Since taking over, he has certainly done his utmost to keep the league going. He has brought in new clubs and written regular and well-received reports, as well as travelling to matches to take team photos.As well as being a great supporter of the Lecale League over many years, he has also been a great supporter of the East Down Churches League.He has attended and made donations for the leaguersquos annual charity cup match, as well as being present at their annual presentation evening.While Jim has been in regular action in recent seasons, he has proven that while form is temporary, class is permanent.When called upon to help a local team out in the Belfast  District League, he has been the only player on the team to win a game.As well as being a title-winning player, he has also proven he is a superb organiser as those that have attended the Lecale Leaguersquos th and th anniversary evenings know.In fact, so many turned up at the th anniversary event that lsquohouse fullrsquo notices had to go up.He even ran out of anniversary mugs for those who had played in the league over the years.While the Lecale League may not have as many teams as it did had in the past, the fact that it is still going is mainly thanks to Jim.It is also worth noting that with his guidance, the many charity tournaments he runs every season have raised a lot of money for Marie Curie and provided some great action for players.It is thanks to Jim and the late Pat Morgan that the league has been going now for over  years. Herersquos hoping Jim will keep it going for many more to come when the current pandemic passes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-PIPS.jpg","title":"PIPS Downpatrick closes its doors after 16 years’ service  ","story":"A LOCAL suicide prevention group started by a grieving Killough mother  years ago has closed its doors for good.The McAteer family, who were behind PIPS Downpatrick, have stepped down from running the group which is credited with saving many lives locally.They received hundreds of thank-up messages from iniduals and families they have helped after they announced the news on social media.Josephine McAteer started PIPS Downpatrick after her  year-old son Gerard took his own le after a night out in .She later described his loss like ldquobeing under water and ldquohell and spoke of how she had to wait eight months for grief counselling while having to deal with the stigma of how her son died.Determined to improve the local support to families like hers, Josephine was inspired by another bereaved parent, Philip McTaggart who founded PIPS Belfast, to get the group up and running.She was often one of first early callers to a familyrsquos door after they had lost a family member and offered direct help to parents whose children where going through a crisis.Mrs McAteer was joined later by her daughter Brenda, son Patrick and daughter-in-law Andrea who were all heavily involved in the group as well as managing fund-raising activities.The family suffered another sad loss six years after Gerardrsquos death when his brother Michael died from a brain tumour at the age of .PIPS Downpatrick funded counsellors and therapists to provide talk therapy as well as suicide awareness training and holistic therapies, mentoring and mediation classes.The group were often able to provide one to one counselling quickly and became a collective voice for families left traumatised by the loss of their loved ones.Brenda explained the reasoning behind the emotional reason to close.ldquoWe set out to highlight suicide and the stigma around it and we do feel we have done a good job, she said.ldquoIt was always going to come to an end and we never thought we would last this long. Even before the pandemic hit last year, wersquod got to a point where we were considering closing. Then the pandemic happened and we knew that it wasnrsquot the right time. We just had to keep going.ldquoAfter Christmas we knew we all needed to have time for ourselves and our families as we realised that so much of our own lives were being out on hold doing the voluntary work. Mum is also getting older, shersquos  now, and we just felt that we had done as much as we could.She stressed that all counselling sessions promised would continue they were complete.ldquoWe have been family run on a voluntary basis and due to the generosity of the local community, we were able to pay up to three therapists at any given time with no waiting time for those in distress or despair, added Brenda.She said that while the lockdown had presented challenges to the group regarding fund-raising and provision of support, counselling work continued through Zoom.ldquoTherersquos been some great fund-raising and we have been truly grateful but we just felt it was time to step back.Brenda said that while she hope that others may well organise and take over the gap that PIPS Downpatrickrsquos closure may leave, she felt that local mental health provision had moved on since the group started.ldquoWe would hope that the statutory services run by the Trust will continue. There are now mental health social workers in all the surgeries, yet  years ago you wouldnrsquot have heard of this, she added.Brenda said that while her family was sad at the closure, they were all very proud of what they had achieved with the help of the local community.ldquoWe truly believe we have saved lives and while it has been challenging at times, I wouldnrsquot have missed it for the world. I met such wonderful people and we would like to thank everyone who worked with us and supported us.A helpful leaflet called The Art of Conversation on how to talk to a person feeling potentially suicidal is available from local group Suicide Down to Zero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Running.jpg","title":"Running changes in 2021  ","story":"A SPORTING activity which seems to have developed a bit of a boom in these days of winter lockdown in the midst of the spread of coronavirus is running.With team action below elite level being halted in every sport, and gyms being forced to shut, many people around Down District have taken to pounding the roads for a run, either by themselves, or within their bubble.Whilst current regulations are strict, as long as the running is within that bubble, socially-distanced, and in the runnerrsquos own locality, then it is proving to be a very beneficial outlet for many who are enjoying the activity.Alison Carroll, who is a committee member with East Down Athletics Club, said that she has definitely noticed more people around Down District pounding the pavements.ldquoRunning outside on onersquos own, is recognised by people as being low-risk in terms of the potential for the spread of covid-, she said.ldquoI think even before they were shut, people perhaps became a bit more unsure about using gyms, but still wanted to maintain their fitness and that is where running came in for many of them.Data recently released by the mile-tracking app Strava has shown just how people have reacted to the pandemic. In , the  gained two million new members worldwide per month.The Strava team wrote in the report: ldquoAt the global level, the Covid- pandemic resulted in a rise of activity on Strava like wersquove never seen before, far surpassing our normal projections.In the UK, from March to May, members logged  per cent more outdoor activities than would be expected for that time of year, making the UK the most active global nation for outdoor activity.Alison continued: ldquoIt was a very bad year for everyone last year, and unfortunately this year has started in much the same way. With running though, it is one of those sports that is still accessible to us to take part in.When the regulations on sporting activity took hold, Alison said she and other members of the club were fastidious in following them to the letter.ldquoWe took our directive closely from Sport NI. We were able to develop a training plan that our members could follow inidually in January, and our members, because of the fact they are associated with the club, are particularly stringent about following the protocols as they should be done.ldquoRunning is something that can still be done outside, safely, and at a distance. Unless, for example you are running in a train of people, in these times, it is still a relatively low-risk activity. Both our sport and cycling have been able to proceed relatively well in terms of participation numbers.ldquoAnd from a mental health perspective, it offers so much. It has been a terrible time, for everybody for months with everything that has been happening. People have lost their lives, their loved ones, their livelihoods, running can be a nice outlet to just get away from things for that short time.Things may still be in limbo now in terms of planning any sporting activities locally in the district, but East Down AC members are still keeping their fingers crossed that the year ahead can still be one which will become more positive the longer into it we get.ldquoThis time last year, we would have had all our members training a lot, said Alison. ldquoThis year of course, we are not able to offer that. The Jimmyrsquos K is obviously a big event traditionally in the local athletics calendar, but that can attract around  runners. At the moment, it is just too dicy to even entertain that we could host that.ldquoHowever, we havenrsquot given up hope that we can still have some action to speak of later in the year with events. We would urge our members to keep training, keep themselves ready for when things can come back.ldquoWe know there are people out there who are naturally struggling with how things are. However people are there for you. The amount of virtual contact we all now have is something to embrace in these times. We have found we can even run a virtual league, which is something.Alison is hopeful that normal service can be resumed soon, as for many it is a huge leline to be a member of a running club.ldquoSome people are solitary. They may live alone, or work long hours alone. For those people, coming to the club to train, is as important in terms of getting face-to-face company with others.ldquoThese are the type of runners who donrsquot come to win the medals, they donrsquot come with winning as being the most important thing. It is about that human connection.ldquoDefinitely when I look around the town in Downpatrick, I can see more people out running, especially around the Quoile River and on the streets.ldquoRunning is a great outlet. It is not expensive, and for members of our club in particular, without it they would all be a lot more lonely..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Schools.jpg","title":"Schools set for closure to pave way for merger  ","story":"A PLAN to open a new co-educational voluntary grammar school for , pupils in Downpatrick from September  has been announced by the Education Authority.A two-month public consultation began today, with the final decision to be taken by Education Minister Peter Weir.Under the proposal St Patrickrsquos Grammar School would merge with St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School.Adverts announcing the proposed dates of closure for all three schools and the opening of the new school have been placed by the Education Authority in todayrsquos Recorder.The Board of Governors at St Patrickrsquos are opposed to the merger and have reaffirmed their opposition this week, while De La Salle and St Maryrsquos are both in favour of the controversial plan going ahead.In a statement issued last night the Board of Governors at St Patrickrsquos called on parents, past pupils and members of the public to make their views known over the next two months.They said: ldquoThe outcome of this consultation will have a lasting impact, not just in the school, with staff and pupils, but its ramications will be felt throughout the local community in East Down.ldquoThe Board of Governors and management do not believe the case has been made for the proposals as currently outlined and will be re-stating the reasons for this as part of the public consultation process. That said, the Board and management are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.ldquoThe Board and management ask the parents of pupils, past pupils and members of the public impacted by these proposals to make their voices heard by participating in the consultation process. This is a matter for the entire community ndash not just those directly involved in education.The statement continued: ldquoFor over  years, St Patrickrsquos [the Red High] has been at the heart of the local community as a centre of learning, a resource hub and as an active contributor to civic le.ldquoPupils, past and present, have made and continue to make signicant contributions in the fields of sport, art, music, business and public service.ldquoThe motivation of the Board of Governors and management of the school is to ensure the widest range of parental and pupil choice remains available in the East Down region.Last December, the chairman of the Board of Governors, Dr Aidan Hamill, lost an application to the High Court for a judicial review questioning the Department of Educationrsquos authority to go ahead with the proposal before securing agreement from its governors.Under the merger plan the new school would educate girls and boys aged - with an admission of  pupils per year, with up to a maximum of % of pupils admitted through academic selection.Grammar schools in Northern Ireland normally admit students exclusively through academic selection.It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The closure of the three schools will also mean the loss of distinctive local school unorms as well as requiring all teaching and support staff to reapply for jobs at the proposed new school.The controversial amalgamation has been put forward by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the De La Salle Congregation, who are the trustees of all three schools.St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School have declined to comment this week.However, both schools previously welcomed the proposed amalgamation, which originally included merging St Columbarsquos College in Portaferry.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle, said in December that he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He said at the time: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, principal of St Maryrsquos, said last September that the merger reflected her values and belief in all-ability schools.She said: ldquoIn terms of social justice, I feel the move is very important.

Technology will be used to provide a back of iconic locations such as Slieve Patrick, the Rock of Cashel, the Giantrsquos Causeway and Slemish Mountain. This is a musical and visual tale of ancient times that is relevant and attractive to modern Ireland.The St Patrick Show will also feature spoken word from  Grammy-nominated Fontaines DC frontman Grian Chatten and other well-known artists.The show will be filmed and be available virtually at first, but has the potential to create a new dinner-theatre culture at the St Patrick Centre and to travel internationally.ldquoWe already have interest from New York and Washington for this exciting project, said Dr Campbell. ldquoWe had planned four shows during St Patrickrsquos Week at the St Patrick Centre, but now due to Covid Restrictions this will be a virtual online event.It is anticipated that rehearsals will begin next month, subject government restrictions, with filming dates in early March.When restrictions lt, dinner theatre audiences in Downpatrick will not only drink in the refreshing story of Patrick this summer, but taste unique recipes created by celebrity chef Terry McCoyrsquos, showcased in his book, Saint Patrickrsquos Plate.Funding has come from from the Arts Council, the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland and Newry Mourne and Down Council.The aim is to have the show in place, marketed and ready for theof the tourism season.The St Patrick Centre is currently in discussion with Tourism Ireland about releasing the virtual event in tourist markets around the world, particularly in the United States.Details can be found on the St Patrick Centrersquos website: www.saintpatrickcentre.Artists are being asked to submit their CVs and tapes via email at stpatrickcentreshow@gmail.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Speeder.jpg","title":"Speeder clocked at 82mph – double road speed limit  ","story":"A DRIVER has been clocked travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick.The figure mdash confirmed by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership mdash was recorded on an electronic speed indicator device which was one of a number put in place across the district last year.While the provision of the device at the entrance to a sports pitch at the Strangford Road was welcomed, a number of residents believe that the device should be located further back long the main road as the speed of drivers along this particularly busy and built-up area is a major concern.Some Strangford Road residents argue that the problem with the speeding device is that it is in the wrong location, given that it is just a few hundred yards from the start of a mph zone close to the townrsquos war memorial.They say that effectively, the speed restriction sign is policing only small section of the busy main road where there are literally just a handful of homes.Further back along the road, there are several major housing developments, many where young families live. There is also a busy local authority garage and depot and a private care nursing home, with this section of road governed by a mph limit.Residents say that the overwhelming majority of drivers who speed along the road are travelling from the Strangford direction and that the issue could be addressed mdashthe speed indicator sign was relocated further back to the entrance to Lecale Park mdashit has to have any signicant impact on the speeding.Those who live at this part of Downpatrick say while the majority of drivers obey the mph speed limit, there are a number who do not.The new speed indicator devices, designed to make drivers aware of their speed and to slow down, are dotted across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area and have been warmly welcomed.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillor John Trainor say the speeding data recorded by the devices and released by the Policing and Community and Safety Partnershipshows an average speed reduction in the Downpatrick area of .% and that the new initiative is working.Mr McGrath said that when he and his SDLP colleague initially floated the idea of erecting the speed indicator signs, the feedback was that the such a scheme would not be efficient and would be too expensive, with little reward.He insists that confirmation that in the Downpatrick area alone speeds have reduced by .% in the short time the devices have been in place vindicates their installation.ldquoWhile John and I are delighted to hear that speeds are reducing across the district, we are in no way complacent about this.ldquoThe fact that the PCSP is doubling the provision of speed indicator signs is not only an indication of their efficacy, but also highlights the continued need for them.However, Mr McGrath said he was concerned about the mph speed recorded at the Strangford Road and appealed to all drivers to ensure they stick to the speed limit.Cllr Trainor said plans were in place to provide an additional seven speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoCombining this with infrastructure minister Nichola Mallonrsquos scheme for mph zones at  schools across the country can only help safety on

forthcoming St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick.The decision mdash confirmed on Monday mdash comes a week after a number of councillors urged the local authority to formally cancel the cross-community event due to the continuing coronavirus pandemic.Last yearrsquos cross-community spectacular was cancelled ahead of the first national lockdown to help combat the deadly virus and with infection rates remaining high across the district, the council has finally decided to cancel the event in the grip of the continuing public health emergency.The local authority, which last week would only confirm that it was ldquoreviewing plans for its St Patrickrsquos Day events in line with the current restrictions and ongoing response to the Covid pandemic, told councillors on Monday afternoon that the Downpatrick parade and one in Newry had been postponed, with the wider media informed yesterday.In the wake of other councils postponing their respective St Patrickrsquos Day parades, Newry, Mourne and Down was coming under increasing pressure to follow suit.The local parades have now been added to the growing list of national and international events across Northern Ireland which have been cancelled due to the pandemic, including the North West  motorcycle races.Belfast City Council has cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, with Derry City and Strabane and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon councils currently discussing how their March  events will be celebrated.Local council officials have confirmed that following careful consideration of the current restrictions and the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic, they have ldquoregretfully cancelled the traditional St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations.The organisation has confirmed that it will be hosting some activities and performances online via its tourism and arts social media channels.In addition, training green spotlights on a number of major buildings, including Down Cathedral and St Patrickrsquos Church in Downpatrick, is expected to go ahead as planned,restrictions allow.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said it was with ldquogreat regret that the annual St Patrickrsquos Day parades have been cancelled for the second year in a row.She said the March  events were normally an opportunity to celebrate the districtrsquos connection with St Patrick and the arearsquos important place in his the patron saintrsquos story.ldquoI know how disappointed many will be about this decision and I share their disappointment, said Cllr Devlin. ldquoHowever, the councilrsquos priority at this time is to continue to support the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic across wider society.She said that the decision to cancel was made in the best interests of residents, visitors, festival participants and event partners.She also confirmed that the local authority will continue to review plans for this yearrsquos tourism events programme on an ongoing basis and in line with guidance from the Northern Ireland Executive.Councillors Willie Clarke, Dermot Curran, Billy Walker and Robert Burgess, who last week appealed to the local council to cancel the parade, welcomed the decision and said they were looking forward to the  event going ahead.They said the local authority had to act to avoid any needless delay, warning that there was no way any festival parade could take place in the current Covid climate.Cllr Clarke said people needed to know that the parade would not happen, highlighting the continuing importance of protecting peoplersquos health.Cllr Curran said the event could not possibly have proceeded, given the ongoing public health emergency.He said the Covid situation remained ldquoextremely serious and that news of the parade cancellation would not come as a surprise.Cllr Walker urged council officials not to wait until the ldquoeleventh hour to pull the plug on the parade and hoped that next yearrsquos event will be one of the best ever.Cllr Burgess said

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Picture: Freddie Parkinson Press EyeIt states: “The [Markethill] district further call on our fellow brother Orangeman, Edwin Poots, the Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to immediately stop officials within his department from implementing the Irish Sea border checks.”In its response, Portadown District said: “The NI Protocol is an act of betrayal of the unionist community and our position as a sovereign part of the United Kingdom.“Portadown District is well aware of those elected politicians who voted for the Irish Sea Border, now is the time for you to apologise for your past actions and to pledge to do all that you can to bring it down, eventhat means disobeying your political leaders.”The statement goes on to call for “all unionist parties to take all necessary action to veto the implementation of EU laws through the Stormont Assembly”.\"DUP MLA William IrwinThe Markethill District comprises  lodges with a combined membership of more than .William Irwin posted his own response to the Markethill statement, describing the claim he supported the Irish Sea border as “untrue”. He said: “As an Orangeman of some  years, in the district of Loughgall... I am very disappointed by Markethill District Orange No ’s untrue claim. “I am absolutely at one with the many thousands of unionists across Northern Ireland who find the imposition of this protocol and its outworkings offensive and running contrary to everything we stand for,” he said.“I did not vote for the protocol nor have I supported it. To suggest otherwise is wrong, disingenuous and it would appear politically motivated.”Although the overwhelming majority of comments were supportive of the Markethill position, one reply said: “I was stunned to read the alleged Markethill District statement, andit is authenticated, they have seriously breached protocol for one and the duty of an Orangeman. I sincerely hope a retraction is publicly published andnot Grand Lodge need to step in.”In response to the latest Portadown District statement, one member said: “As much as I welcome this as an Orangeman, and it’s great to see, the only problem is it won’t make a dference until Grand Lodge publicly make the same statement to which I cant see them doing. I hope I’m proved wrong.”The Grand Lodge of Ireland has not yet responded to a request for comment.READ: Orange Order heartland rocked by bitter row over Irish Sea borderREAD: Lodge breaks ranks with Orange Order over New Decade New Approach dealA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!

In line with the Department of Health’s twin track approach to accelerate vaccinations, both the online system and telephone booking line can be used by those in the - age group to make an appointment at one of the seven regional vaccination centres. While demand for vaccination slots is high, people are reminded that there will be enough appointments for everyone in the group so please remain patient. In the last five days the online booking system has been used to make , appointments. People are asked to reserve capacity on the telephone booking linefor those who cannot avail of the online booking facility. Where possible we would encourage booking appointments online. It is also anticipated that demand for telephone bookings will initially be very high. Therefore,you cannot get through initially, please be patient and try again later. Call volumes tend to be lower later in the day. If you can’t get through immediately then try again. The service is available from Monday to Friday .am to .pm. To fall within the - age bracket you must have been born between  April  and  March . Age and identity checks will be conducted at the vaccination centres. People outside the relevant age group should not misuse the online or telephone booking facility. Misuse will only make it more dficult for those to get through who are being prioritised because of their clinical vulnerability. GPs will be working in parallel to the regional vaccination centres and will focus on the  plus age group. This group cannot use this booking facility. GPs will make contact with their patients in this age group, therefore people do not need to phone their GP practice. This twin track approach announced by the Department of Health last week will help accelerate NI’s vaccination programme - ensuring more people can take up the offer of vaccination and help protect themselves against Covid-.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abcfafaceccdaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adcebef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
