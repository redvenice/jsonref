She was 28 and pregnant. Salomon was supposed to be forgotten, erased from history, along with the millions of Jews murdered in the 1940s. But after the defeat of Nazi Germany, her father and stepmother – who in genocide’s lottery survived their daughter – found a cache of her paintings that included one of the most astonishing autobiographical documents of the 20th century. Before she was put on a train to her death, Salomon had set down everything about herself, her family and her world in a coruscating expressionist comic book that she named Life? or Theatre?To be caught up in Salomon’s modern masterpiece is to meet her, love her – and mourn her. Through this intimate visual narrative, we come to know Salomon. Today, we commemorate the victims of the Holocaust with monuments: ranks of concrete blocks or libraries of books closed for ever. But Life? or Theatre? is an open book that makes more sense today than when it was found because it is, in fact, that most contemporary of things: a graphic novel.Death shadows it from the start. In pre-first world war Berlin, a young woman called Charlotte drowns herself. We see her parents by the lake where she died, read the terse newspaper report. This was the aunt the artist was named after. In brilliantly compressed gouache paintings that combine rawness with clever perspectives and intercutting, Salomon shows how her parents met in a field hospital and married during the first world war. The scene depicting their honeymoon has three layers on top of each other, with the newlyweds’ feet coming down a red carpet watched by a bell boy, then entering a hotel bedroom – until finally we glimpse the couple in bed together in the dark.It’s like a storyboard for a Wes Anderson film. Cinema was clearly one of the sources for Salomon’s storytelling experiment. Born in Berlin in 1917, she grew up when the pioneering films of FW Murnau and Fritz Lang were streaming out of the city’s studios. They invented purely visual storytelling – the vampire’s shadow or a row of derelict houses are enough to tell the Dracula story in Murnau’s Nosferatu. As a child of expressionist Berlin, Salomon can communicate startling amounts of information and emotion in a single image. Her telling of Kristallnacht – the Night of the Broken Glass, in 1938, when Jewish people and property were attacked – takes just two images. In one, a crowd of tiny people read a giant poster that spits race hate. In the next, they are attacking Jewish shops.Yet the story Salomon tells is hers and hers alone. There was something tragic about the Salomon family, before their fate was defined by their Jewishness. After an apparently idyllic start to her marriage, and as parent to a young child, her mother sank into despair and threw herself out of a window. Salomon shows her mother’s suicide with precision. The image of herself as a young child dwarfed by her mother’s grave in a blue and black cemetery is overwhelming. Yet Salomon displays an irrepressible capacity for happiness: she makes her governesses’ lives hell with her mischief until she gets one she likes, a young woman who can play the lute and takes her to the seaside.Life? Or Theatre? is subtitled a “singspiel”, meaning a light opera, and songs are even specified for many scenes. In one, a singer on a stage belts out a lyric about love and death. You can listen to the same sad song on headphones nearby. As you do so, your eyes move towards a painting of uniformed Nazis parading in the street after Hitler’s appointment as chancellor in 1933.Young Charlotte’s world was getting brighter, though. The singer in this crackly recording is Paula Lindberg, a star in Weimar Berlin who would marry Salomon’s father, Albert, a celebrated doctor, after her mother’s death. She is portrayed as a gregarious, beautiful, joyous character who lifts the family out of their melancholy. Through Lindberg’s connections (who included Albert Einstein) Salomon meets a charismatic music teacher and artistic guru called Alfred Wolfsohn and becomes his lover.By now she’s an aspiring artist, but is she any good? Salomon seeks reassurance from her lover. A sequence where she waits to meet him in a Berlin park, before they touch hands across a cafe table as he tells her she is capable of creating something special, is so intimate you feel you are there beside them. The affair is portrayed with total candour. In a later scene, they meet and he asks whether they should talk in the street or go upstairs. Next thing they’re in bed, looking at a stain on the wall.It is one of their last meetings. After Kristallnacht, everything gets worse for Berlin’s Jews. Salomon’s father is sacked from his job, then lumpen thugs in raincoats take him away. We see him hunched over a spade in a labour camp. Only his wife’s charm persuades the Nazis to release him – for now. At a dinner party, everyone discusses escape.There’s a devasting twist to Salomon’s story, even before her life was cut short, that I won’t reveal. But there’s triumph, too. In a picture of herself in art class – she got in despite the severe restrictions on Jewish admittance – Salomon is drawing a nude male model alongside fellow students who include one wearing Nazi uniform. Who remembers him? With each year that passes, meanwhile, Salomon’s art gets more acute and alive. • At Jewish Museum, London, from 8 November until 1 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/410177d9436daf1fb3088ff872bd2c143beecc99/0_220_3106_1863/master/3106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c467ad1eb53629ff71bb57d9a7fd9f6","title":"creature comforts steve mccurry portraits of animals in pictures","story":"The legendary US photographer’s favourite shots of creatures and how they interact with humans feature in Animals, his latest book"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c89799c474c6aa5bfc260c55b85c03d53cbf83f/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=918824fc3572717269824eaf55221f0f","title":"bordeaux and beyond the food and drink experiences you cant miss","story":"Whether you want to sip wine in Bordeaux’s most characteristic bars or book in for an immersive cookery course at nearby Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux and its surrounding regions offer a feast of delights for wine and food loversHit the wine trail and master your cookery skillsMake your first stop in Bordeaux the Cité du Vin, a spectacular building on the left bank of the Garonne river that explores the history and culture of wine. It has already welcomed more than a million visitors since it opened in the summer of 2016. Enjoy a glass of wine in the eighth-floor panoramic bar, Le Belvédère, before embarking on Bordeaux’s Urban Wine Trail, which takes visitors on a self-guided tour of Bordeaux’s best bars, some of which have up to 1,000 different wines.Le Vertige serves cheese and charcuterie boards with its long list of wines. At Le Millésime, you can even order one of the premiers grands crus classés by the glass – a château cheval blanc 2004 (€60) goes down well with their posh mini burgers, or just order a glass of regular Bordeaux to enjoy until two in the morning. La Ligne Rouge specialises in little-known wines from foreign domaines including Serbia, Croatia and an English sparkly. It is on the left bank beside one of the oldest bars in Bordeaux, the Grand Bar Castan, a great place to watch the world go by – cars, trams, boats, cyclists and rollerbladers all pass in front of the bar, the interior of which is lined with art nouveau rocaille – an indoor cave with giant palm tree decoration.And don’t miss the Bordeaux Wine Council’s Bar à Vin, in the city’s flatiron building, la Maison Gobineau. Quality wines cost a fraction of what they do elsewhere, and it’s a unique place to drink a glass of Bordeaux supérieur (€2) or a pomerol (€8) beneath an Aubusson tapestry and stained glass windows.Alternatively, you might like to take a wine tour of one of the surrounding châteaux. Wine trails can be organised by boat, bicycle, on foot, hot-air balloon, donkey or horse-drawn carriage. Besides a vineyard tour by bicycle or electric scooter, the Château Marquis de Terme in the Médoc hosts a three-hour tasting of seven grands crus classés wines in the 19th-century workshop. The selection of choice vintages includes pauillac, saint-julien, saint-estèphe, margaux and haut-médoc with Barsac and sauternes dessert wines to complete a full house of the left bank of the Garonne’s most exceptional wines. The sommelier explains the history and essential characteristics of what makes each wine special. Equally refined, dine at the Château Lafaurie Peyraguey’s Restaurant Lalique, which was awarded the Sauternes region’s first and only Michelin star in 2019. At Château de La Dauphine, take a heritage tour in a bright red 2CV car with hilltop tastings accompanied by lamprey rillettes and truffle butter. Stay on in Saint-Émilion for a cooking class in the kitchens of the Château Ambe Tour Pourret. The lesson involves preparing a meal with seasonal, local products and then tasting it with the vineyard’s wine (€120-€160 per person). You won’t ever want to leave.Back in Bordeaux, serious wine lovers should consider a stay at the excellent Le Boutique hotel. The rooms are named after Bordeaux’s vineyards, there’s the in-house wine bar, large cellar and the sommelier Riccardo Mariconti gives tastings twice a day. “We choose five wines to taste, starting with something light and fruity, moving on to médoc, and discuss the acidity, tannins and talk about why guests like a certain appellation.”Broaden your drinking palateIt’s hard to believe, but there are other things to drink in Bordeaux besides wine. As well as having one of the city’s most romantic restaurant gardens, Frida shakes up fabulous cocktails from its glinting bar in the historic centre. For beer lovers, the Brasserie de la Lune’s Darwin pale ale is served on the sand-covered terrace of the Chantiers de la Garonne.For something stronger, pay a visit to Moon Harbour, Bordeaux’s whisky distillery, which was set up by two local friends in the redeveloping Bacalan docks and will produce its first single malt whisky next year. The highlight of the visit is the chai (storage area), which was originally constructed by the Germans during the second world war as a giant concrete fuel depot (the size of a zeppelin) for their submarine base next door. Although wartime events saw that no fuel ever made it into the vast concrete blockhouse, it’s a piece of Bordeaux’s urban history, an astonishing sight and worth a tipple of whisky to experience.To complete the drinking half of your bucket list, Bordeaux is only 90 minutes’ drive from Cognac. All the great Cognac houses including Hennessey, Camus, Rémy Martin, and Martell offer tours and tastings, but Cognac itself is a charming town whose devotion to the fermented ugni blanc grape has lasted unabated since the early 1700s.Taste regional specialities at local food marketsThe Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, including Bordeaux, is a must for foodies. The most picturesque market is at Royan, where 150 traders sell delights such as purple asparagus from Blaye, green asparagus from Les Landes, with oysters and cuttlefish from the Bay of Arcachon. At Brive-La-Gaillarde and Sarlat’s in the Dordogne, market stalls are overflowing with vegetables, dried duck, nougat and honey. Join the locals in the queue at the cheese counter or watch as the restaurateurs squeeze the fruit and search for the best truffles.You could also visit one of Bordeaux’s two new food halls. Opposite the Cité du Vin is the Halles de Bacalan, with 24 food merchants offering the region’s best cuisine du marché. Chef Frédéric Coiffé of L’Échoppe des Halles serves up to 200 dishes a day: delicious combinations of steak, duck, octopus or pork served on orange platters to share. For Coiffé, it’s “the future of food simple, local products served in a fun, convivial atmosphere.” At the other end of Bordeaux is La Boca food hall, which opened last year and houses 15 food bars with giant shared tables in the middle, a chance to eat Mexican, Thai, Italian, Basque, local seafood and then try a dune blanche from Chez Pascal, a bite-sized choux pastry, originally from Cap Ferret.Dine out in styleBordeaux is famed for its brasseries and bistros, many of which have been there since the mid-19th century. Try the traditional La Belle Epoque, or Le Quatrième Mur – recommended by EasyJet’s crew performance manager, Renaud Herin. Save up for a meal at Le Chapon Fin, a posh restaurant frequented by Sarah Bernhardt and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.For a more modern menu, head to one of Bordeaux’s most sought-after tables at Racines, where Glasgow-born chef Daniel Gallacher serves creative, delectable food inspired by his Scottish roots and training under Alain Ducasse.End the evening with a diamant noir, a sugar-coated, ganache dark chocolate by Cadiot-Badie, which has been making confectionary since 1826.Don’t leave Bordeaux without …Tasting the local speciality, a canelé, a tiny vanilla and rum-flavoured cake that looks like a miniature fluted jelly mould. The inside is spongy and the outside is a delicate caramelised crust. Locals eat them for breakfast, elevenses, lunch and dinnertime, and they can even be paired with Bordeaux wine.Start planning your adventure in Bordeaux.

House of Santon did not respond to requests for comment.The closure threatened the jobs of 200 workers in a yard that had built hundreds of ships and played a part in the second world war shipbuilding effort. Some Babcock workers were reassigned to a facility in Devonport.On Tuesday, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general who is seeking re-election in Torridge and West Devon, which contains Appledore, tweeted:Babcock’s withdrawal from Appledore came at a difficult time for what remains of the once-mighty British shipbuilding industry. Belfast’s Harland and Wolff yard, which built the Titanic, also went into administration but was rescued last month.A review by the industrialist Sir John Parker recommended that some tenders for shipbuilding work be restricted to British firms.

Because some people are eating less of it, when they do eat it they want to really enjoy it.In the drinks aisle, the rise of craft beer means that sales of canned beer and lager now outstrip those in bottles.

From today and for the next four weeks, our international film series will tell the stories of five cities that reflect these isions in surprising and troubling waysThirty years ago, a rapt world watched the unfolding of one of the great city stories of all time. Every hammer blow chipping away the imposing grey blocks of the Berlin Wall, which had come to embody global geopolitical isions, seemed to herald a more united future.Since then, however, our world has fractured anew and our cities feel more ided than ever. When the Berlin Wall fell, there were two border walls in Europe now there are 15. Nor is this fracture merely physical: many cities are havens of wealth and privilege for those who hold the access codes, hives of struggle and poverty for those who do not. Wherever I travel to report I have always been struck by how different people can have such contrasting experiences of the same city – and it’s no different at home, in my neighbourhood of Camberwell, south London, where upscale coffee shops and gang violence occupy the same stretches of road.When we started  Cities in 2014, many of the stories we reported, on topics such as gentrification and car use, were ultimately about ision and inequality – and that was before the votes for Donald Trump and for Brexit upended the US and UK, the war in Syria sparked an unprecedented migration crisis, and climate change finally seized the imagination of those who realised that it was likely to be the poor who suffered most.Divided Cities is the result of that reckoning – a new global documentary series of five stories, from five cities around the world, that reflect these major faultlines in surprising and troubling ways.Over the last 12 months our team –  executive producer Jess Gormley, producer Anetta Jones, film-maker Max Duncan and myself – worked with our contacts around the world to identify what we believe to be some of the more vital and startling ways cities are ided today. All we knew at first was that we wanted to move beyond Trump and Brexit – both of which have sucked up so much oxygen that many equally important stories are going unreported – and to rethink ision from a fresh perspective.That meant avoiding some quite well-covered cities: the “peace walls” of Belfast, for example, or the famously ided city of Jerusalem, a place as thick with history as it is with journalists. It also meant moving on from certain well-trodden urban inequalities such as gentrification or the conflict between cyclists and drivers, which, though emotive flashpoints, are issues we have covered (and will continue to cover) in dozens of different ways.Instead, the stories that jumped out to us came from five continents and embodied five entirely different conceptions of what it means to be a “ided city”. We started in Nicosia with a classic of the genre, as it were: the UN-patrolled barricade that cleaves the island of Cyprus into a mostly Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north. The story that seized us most strongly there, however, was new: a young generation who didn’t experience the war, and who reject the military conscription that requires them to point guns at their friends across what is now an shabby, overgrown buffer zone.In Africa, meanwhile, we were fortunate enough to be present on the ground for one the most dramatic, dangerous and daring events in the world’s ongoing migration crisis: a night-time climb of the border fence at Melilla. Along with Ceuta, Melilla is a truly unusual city – a Spanish outpost in north Africa, separated from Morocco by a fence. Hundreds of people, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, end their treacherous journeys across the desert by hiding out in forest camps near the fence, waiting for the right moment – sometimes as long as six months – to try to climb en masse in the dead of night. In May this year, one attempt saw almost 60 migrants make it over. They stepped on to EU soil, claiming asylum. But the far-right political party Vox wants them out, and is proposing two ideas that will sound troublingly familiar: to “make Spain great again” by building, you guessed it, a wall. It’s a closed-door attitude that makes no provision for another quirk of this fascinating city: 30,000 people cross through the fence daily for work, but who must return to Morocco each night. Many work as “porters”, exploiting a legal grey area that allows them to carry goods tax-free. The trade is tolerated by the authorities, and the economic benefits it brings are relied on by both Melillans and Moroccans.Other cities lack physical barriers entirely, but are no less split. The socialist capital of Havana boasts a truly bizarre system of two currencies: one for the socialist state sector, which pays the salaries of doctors and other civil servants and one for the newly booming private sector, which is pegged to the US dollar and is worth 24 times the state currency. This oddity leads to some obscene ironies, such as doctors earning so little that they can’t afford to feed their own families, leading some to abandon their training and communities and take up unrelated private sector roles, such as driving taxis for tourists.The very wealth of the United States to the north, meanwhile, generates equally perverse schisms. One of the worst of the country’s so-called “food deserts” is in Memphis, Tennessee, where many neighbourhoods lack what seems a basic right in richer neighbourhoods – a supermarket. For poorer residents, most of whom don’t own cars, that either means long journeys on multiple buses, or feeding your kids junk from fast-food restaurants and convenience stores, where much of what is sold as food doesn’t truly qualify for the name.Finally, if there is one unfolding phenomenon that unites us all in ision, so to speak, it is the environmental crisis, rapidly shaping up to be the greatest inequality issue we are likely to face as a species. As India’s capital, Delhi, grows dark under a cloud of smog that refuses to dissipate, following a summer where more than a hundred Delhi residents died as a direct result of overheating, we found a city riven by “climate apartheid”. Some can afford to protect themselves from the elements (via cars, air purifiers, and air conditioned spaces). Others must live, work, suffer and sometimes die in the heat and pollution.None of these isions is carved in stone. In each city, we found irrepressible people who don’t just passively accept their fate. The young Nicosians willing to face prison rather than take up arms against other teenagers on the opposite side of the ide. The migrants to Melilla who lift each other to better lives, and the Spanish citizens who help them to keep Spain a welcoming country. The Cuban doctors who celebrate the successes of socialism yet bravely speak out against the warping effects of the two currencies. The Memphians who try, and fail, and try again to get fresh, nutritious food to their neighbourhoods so that McDonald’s and CVS aren’t the only places to get a meal.After five years of  Cities, we wanted to ask a question that has hummed behind most of the work we’ve done: is ision inevitable?

No one even knew the meaning of betriebsbedingte kündigung – compulsory redundancy – or where unemployment benefits came from. In the GDR, work had been so much more than a source of income life revolved around the workplace. Companies often had their own singing or sports clubs, and their own childcare and health services. My dad, a metal worker, lost his job after the unification. It was a shock – he felt guilty and ashamed. But it took him years to find the words to express his feelings. “I didn’t realise the gravity of the situation,” he said to me 20 years later.Everyday life was dramatically altered after 1989, from the price of rent to the way health insurance was organised. Most people struggled to find a sure footing in the new world. Many were overwhelmed by these events – but they were unlikely to speak openly about it.I went to a boarding school in Eisenhüttenstadt, an industrial town near the Polish border. The town has lost more than half of its population since 1990 – several housing districts have been demolished altogether, and a whole generation is missing. Even today, if you are a young person in eastern Germany and want a traditional, well-paid career in a large corporation, you have to leave your hometown and go west.In the 90s, most people in the east had quite different existential problems. The unification of Germany was not between equals but between a poor, community-orientated, working-class society and a wealthy, middle-class society that prized self-improvement.In the 00s, the pace of change slowed, but that was also a time when nobody wanted to hear stories from the east. There was no room at all for criticism of the west in public debate. Major media outlets, headquartered in the west, often indulged in cliched portrayals of east Germans, mainly as Stasi officers, neo-Nazis or unemployed. If anyone criticised the hardships of the transformation, they were very quickly discredited as Jammerossi – the whining east German.For a lot of west Germans, nothing changed with the fall of the wall – it seemed that the Bundesrepublic just got a bit bigger with unification. The hardest thing most of them had to stomach was the change of the postcodes – and, as the joke went, that the chocolate bar Raider was suddenly renamed Twix. It seemed that capitalism and democracy had won, that the world would only become more free, more open.It is often stunning to see how little west Germans know about history and culture of the GDR. “I knew nothing about East Germany, I felt mentally and emotionally much closer to France or England,” said a woman who invited me to a talk in Cologne. On a book tour in west Germany a couple of years ago, I often felt that, to those who came along, the east seemed as far away as Beijing.The official narrative over the past 30 years has been of unification as a great German success story. But in the last few years, the isions between east and west have grown deeper than ever. The electoral successes of the far-right AfD in eastern federal states such as Saxony and Brandenburg has prompted much media debate about what the matter is with the east. They have freedom – and yet they are still so angry. What is wrong with them?These statistics are not as contradictory as they might first appear. For a long time, east Germans lacked the inner freedom, the time and simply the words to explain how the transformation of their world after 198990 affected them. Disappointment may have been brewing for a long time, but it was not openly discussed or heard. But since life satisfaction has improved for east Germans, people have become more capable of expressing what happened to them over the previous 30 years. People needed to find stability in their personal life in order to be able to express their anger and frustrations.In 2019, the debate in Germany is finally changing: other voices and perspectives have taken the floor. Previously taboo topics are now being talked about, maybe for the first time since 1990: the trauma of the post-unification period the controversial heritage of the Treuhand – the institution which oversaw the privatisation of thousands of state-owned companies the lack of representation of east Germans in leading positions around the country (Angela Merkel’s years as chancellor continue to be the high-profile exception to this rule).Many west Germans might now begin to realise, for the first time since 1989, that the end of communism and the dismantling of a dictatorship wasn’t such a clearcut victory. Something was also lost. The end of the GDR opened up many opportunities for the east Germans, but it also made them more sensitive to change. There is a fear of suddenly losing the life satisfaction they have built up in the years since 1989.A lot of the things that are a source of pain in east Germany – rural exodus, ageing populations, lack of infrastructure – are problems that permeate everywhere: throughout Germany and in many western societies with growing inequality. It’s about time that a proper debate about these issues takes place.• Sabine Rennefanz is a writer for Berliner Zeitung "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2651769b30e67513b0fff1b79c2df30133d2b18/0_146_4415_2650/master/4415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fedb5c1d96679e72bd09bca61926bee","title":"democrats won virginia and are claiming victory in kentucky whats next","story":"The latest contests point the Democrats to a path forward. Whether that road actually leads to the White House remains to be seenOn election day 2019, the Democrats swept the Virginia legislature, and appear to have won the Kentucky governor’s mansion. Trends visible when Nancy Pelosi reclaimed the House speaker’s gavel a year ago remain ever present.America’s suburbs continues to abandon their traditional political home even as rural voters remain energized by an unpopular president. On Tuesday, impeachment wasn’t the vote magnet the president’s minions swore that it would be.In Kentucky, Democrat Andy Beshear, the state’s attorney general, appears to have ousted Matt Bevin, the incumbent Republican who has refused to concede defeat. Less than half a percent separates the two candidates. Trump had triumphed in the Bluegrass State by 30 points. If not gone, his magic is not readily transferable.For the record, Beshear won the very suburban counties that had gone for Bevin four years earlier. Meanwhile, voters in Kentucky’s urban precincts flocked to the polls for the Democrat. Jefferson County, home to Louisville, voted Democratic by better than two-to-one.On the Monday night immediately before the election, Trump had headlined a Maga rally for Bevin and was joined onstage by Kentucky’s senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul. There, Trump proclaimed: “If you lose, they are going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. You can’t let that happen to me!” At the same gathering, Paul had urged the press corps to out the whistleblower who is the bane of Trump’s existence, a reminder of libertarianism’s neo-Confederate strains.Hours later, on Tuesday morning, Trump then tweeted that the “impeachment hoax had fired up voters in Kentucky”. Maybe so, but not exactly the way Trump had thought.Instead, Trump’s presence comes with a downside: it energizes his opposition. As to be expected, Donald Trump Jr told Fox News’ viewers as the results rolled in, “This has nothing to do with Trump.”To be sure, Trump and Bevin may have also been hurt by the headlines that emerged as Kentuckians went to the polls. Gordon Sondland, Trump’s ambassador to the European Union, had corrected his impeachment testimony and admitted that there had been a quid pro quo involving Ukraine and Hunter Biden.Meanwhile, McConnell who doubles as Senate majority leader, was signaling that while he thought the Senate would acquit Trump in an impeachment trial, bipartisan agreement would be needed for the trial to proceed. “This is not something the majority can micromanage like it can on almost any other issue,” said McConnell.In Virginia, the Republicans fate was gloomier as they lost the state senate and the house of delegates. For the first time since 1992, the Democrats hold control of both legislative chambers. Adding insult to injury, Juli Briskman, the cyclist who flipped-off the presidential motorcade two years earlier, won her bid for local office in Virginia’s Loudon County.Looking back, the Republicans’ defeat in the 2017 gubernatorial race was a harbinger of what actually came next. Suburban Virginians again made themselves heard and stuck a thumb in the president’s eye. Against this backdrop, Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger, freshman congresswomen from swing districts in Virginia must be breathing more easily.The two had publicly announced their support for the House’s impeachment inquiry in a Washington Post op-ed along with five other freshman with national security credentials. They also served as catalysts for Democrats moving forward on the topic.Spanberger is a former CIA operative while Luria is an ex-navy commander. Together, they are a reminder that the House Democrats are not just about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the party’s left wing, and that Democrats have found traction outside the New York and California’s big cities.While Democrats have reason to smile, perspective remains essential. While Tuesday’s results can be spun as a defeat for Trumpism, Kentucky is not a swing state and Bevin was an unpopular governor. A year from now, it will appear in the president’s column regardless of the national results. The last time Kentucky voted Democratic was in 1996 for Bill Clinton and Ross Perot was on the ballot.Next, Beshear ran as a moderate, something that cannot be said of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The former is a self-described democratic-socialist and the latter wants to remake capitalism in her own image. By the numbers, Warren appears poised to lose to Trump as suburban voters are turned-off by her plans for redistributive economics.In that sense, the latest contests point the Democrats to a path forward. Whether that road actually leads to the White House remains to be seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d55d8239c95012e321f96a125af75966b64588fc/0_72_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5597da4119900aa008875d2f836f8b0a","title":"ok boomer meme older generations","story":"Older workers and retirees are struggling to survive. They need solidarity – not rich kids shouting ‘OK Boomer’ at themYou might not have noticed, but apparently you’re living through something of a revolution. In a New York Times article last week, Taylor Lorenz documents the “OK Boomer” meme that’s become “ a rallying cry for millions of fed up kids” and an “endlessly repeated retort to the problem of older people who just don’t get it”. Now it’s war, the Times asserts: Gen Z has finally snapped over climate change and financial inequality.The meme is mostly used by young people on social media to respond to perceived condescension from older users – but it’s been touted as a way to understand why job and life prospects are constrained for so many young people. It’s not capitalists, it’s not the politicians who serve them – it’s “boomers”, or everyone born in the two decades after the second world war.Like much of online culture, “OK Boomer” tells us something about the cultural dominance of upper-middle-class youth. These young people are surrounded by baby boomers who’ve “hoarded all the wealth” and polluted the planet in the process. They haven’t had to witness – or deal with the ramifications of – old age and precarity for millions of working people in that generational cohort. Instead they get to revel without self-reflection in oedipal angst about their elders – many of whom were kind enough to pass them their ill-gotten privileges.Workers of all ages, after all, barely earn enough to survive, much less save for retirement. A 2018 PBS Newshour report notes that half of Americans approaching age 65 have less than $25,000 in savings. One in four don’t even have $1,000.Far from sitting atop riches, many of them never saw their household wealth recover after the Great Recession. They were victims of corporate raiders, neoliberal deregulation and predatory loans – and the situation is even more dire for those of them who are black and brown.With this in mind, let’s retranslate the meme Lorenz is championing.Boomer: “I can’t afford to live on social security. My promised pension disappeared. I might need to get out of retirement and start working part time again. I worry about the future.”It’s true, of course, that young people will be entering into a potentially even more perilous future than their elders. We’ll be the ones who will have to live through the worst of the climate catastrophe and spend the bulk of our years working jobs that aren’t unionized, provide few benefits and promise little stability.Past generations entered a relatively more favorable labor market, one won by decades of class struggle and organization. They also saw the passage of important social reforms. And thank God they did. Imagine how many more older workers would be destitute and worse without the protections offered by Medicare and Social Security.Rather than scoff at the relative privileges of a few, we should be trying to recreate some of the conditions that made life a bit better during the postwar years “boomers” were born into. That means, of course, organizing against our bosses and pressuring our political leaders to reshape the economy to work for the many, not snarking at the working people who spent years of their lives providing for us.After all, the problem with generational analysis is that even though it claims to be rooted in economic realities, it cannot see the reality of class. There were plenty of “Gen Xers” and older “millennials” convincing “boomers” to refinance away the small amount of wealth they had accumulated. There were also plenty of “boomers” who didn’t feel any generational solidarity while exploiting people their own age and amassing vast fortunes in the process.If “we” have to ide ourselves, it makes sense to look for these class isions rather than inventing common cultural characteristics across generations. But if we are to consider age, let’s try to harness the wisdom that our working-class elders can impart to us: the stories about bosses betraying their promises, about political elites neglecting those with nothing to offer them, about lifetimes of hard work not being rewarded with a peaceful retirement or even the respect of those we nurtured.Nothing is guaranteed in life – it has to be earned. But for most, “bootstrapping” ourselves to success is an illusion. The only way we improve our lot as workers is through collective action. That means knowing who your friends are and who your enemies are.Here’s a hint: it’s not “boomers” – it’s that investment banker you went to high school with."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbc5dbd4da8b142d73e3badc5410bf50e5ebb20b/0_20_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2472f598047bb1be98a660f7ccbd22f6","title":"unconditional love for pet not political party adrian chiles","story":"More than a third of the electorate didn’t bother going to the ballot box at the last election. I have been trying to find out whySo I have been going around the country asking those people why they don’t vote. I was expecting to get a lot of stuff along the lines of “I just don’t care”, “I can’t be bothered” “Politicians are all uselessdishonest”, “They’re all the same”, “They let us down over Brexit” and so on. And I got a fair amount of that, but a couple of other major things, too.On West Bromwich High Street, the main problem seemed to be the weakening of tribal loyalties. They are still there, of course I got more than one person telling me: “I always vote Labour, Ade. It’s like supporting the Albion, isn’t it?” But I don’t think it should be like supporting a football team it’s more important than that.My heart sinks whenever I hear anyone say they always, no matter what, vote Labour or Conservative or SNP or whatever, because that kind of political loyalty is often just an easy alternative to even the most casual intellectual inquiry into the complexities of policies. I suppose if you are going to vote for A Particular Party, come rain or shine, there’s not much point taking that much interest in the detail anyway. No, unconditional love is all very well for children, football teams and pets, but not for politics.Yet there is less of it about. Very often in West Bromwich I was told something along the lines of: “My family were always LabourConservativewhatever, so that’s what I always voted for, but now I just don’t know who to choose.” In other words, in the absence of a strong family policy, they have to give actual thought to who to vote for.This would be a good thing, as long as the electors felt equipped to make a decision but very many of the people I have spoken to do not. At a food bank in Hastings this week, a typical answer to my “Why don’t you vote?” question was, rather sweetly: “Well, I’d like to, but I really don’t understand any of it.” On the one hand, this isn’t surprising, as the rudiments of our political system are not really taught in schools. And then there is the challenge of picking some truth out of the skipfuls of claims, counter-claims, obfuscation, fake news, downright lies and general waste matter emanating from politicians everywhere.On the other hand, my interviewees’ pleas of ignorance were a nonsense. As I barked at many clients of that food bank: “What do you mean, you don’t understand it? That implies you think there are people out there who do understand it! There aren’t. I definitely don’t. And anyone – not least MPs themselves – who claims to be fully across everything simply doesn’t know enough about it. Not voting, or even registering, might be your political decision. Fair enough. But, please, don’t decide not to vote because you think you don’t know enough your vote is as valid as anybody else’s, for heaven’s sake.” Rant over.• Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10177899ae623fc716dec45b3e377a76067b5ff4/0_112_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b2db1ce5c82f5b62989bf784a61e039","title":"doctors europe call for tighter control of traditional chinese medicine","story":"Exclusive: European experts fear WHO recognition will encourage use of unproven therapies Europe’s leading doctors are to call for tighter regulation of traditional Chinese medicine, anxious that recent recognition by the World Health Organization will encourage the use of unproven therapies that can sometimes be harmful.The Federation of European Academies of Medicine (FEAM) and the European Academies’ Science Advisory Council will issue a joint statement on Thursday urging the WHO to clarify how traditional Chinese medicine and other complementary therapies should be used.Earlier this year, the WHO decided to add a chapter on traditional Chinese medicine to the International Classification of Diseases, which lists treatments available globally for medical conditions. The ICD is influential with governments, which look at its recommendations when deciding how to spend health budgets.The WHO says this is not an endorsement, but European scientists fear it will be used by manufacturers to promote their herbal and other remedies – and that the public will be misled into thinking there is good evidence that they work and are safe. There is a risk, they say, that some people with a serious medical condition may even avoid or delay going to a conventional doctor.Doctors stress the importance of evidence-based medicine, said Prof George Griffin, the president of FEAM. “We don’t give drugs and surgical treatments unless there is real evidence that they work and do no damage and basically the feeling is that most of the traditional Chinese medicine drugs are unregulated,” he said. “They are not tested properly for toxicity. They probably vary greatly between batches produced, for example seaweed, which is the latest, and they may be harmful.“The other side of the equation is that they may be deluding patients into thinking they are taking appropriate therapies for serious disease.”Traditional Chinese medicine includes herbal remedies, tai chi, skin cupping and acupuncture. Its practitioners are interested in the entirety of the mind and body and do not diagnose on the basis of isolated symptoms. They believe that vital energy, called qi, circulates through body channels, connected to organs and functions. While many of the therapies have been in use for hundreds of years, there is little evidence of benefit from scientific trials and some evidence of harm.The doctors behind the statement recognise that traditional Chinese medicine has sometimes produced treatments of real value to the world. The most notable recently is artemisinin therapy, which is the mainstay of malaria treatment in Africa. But, they point out, the original artemisia preparations were chemically modified and rigorously tested to produce the drugs used in combination today.They say they agree with the WHO’s good intention to encourage the rigorous testing of remedies used by so many people. But they think the listing of traditional Chinese medicine will be misconstrued.“Multiple risks of harm from herbal ingredients have been documented,” they will warn. Sometimes herbal remedies have been adulterated with chemicals. Interaction with conventional drugs can be a serious threat. And acupuncture, they will say, “is not necessarily harmless”. A review in 2017 found many injuries, infections and adverse reactions.The doctors “urge the European commission and member states to do more to ensure that all medical products and procedures are subject to an appropriate level of evaluation for quality, safety and efficacy consistent with standardised testing procedures”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e92de7c7ca26686954530ead84058f3a55773b28/171_0_5135_3081/master/5135.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa821d27b46a47efc308f0dfcba41d5f","title":"have you been invited to take part in the uk citizens climate assembly","story":"We want to hear from some of the 30,000 who have received an invitation from MPs to join the climate emergency discussionFrom Wednesday, 30,000 people will begin to receive invitations to take part in a citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency convened by MPs.A demographically representative sample of the population will then be selected from those who respond, with 110 people taking part in the Climate Assembly UK over four weekends in Birmingham next year.Participants will be asked to discuss how the UK should respond to the climate emergency and what policies they would like to see implemented to meet the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, now enshrined in law.We want to hear from people who have received an invitation to take part about their views on participating.We are interested in hearing from people who have received an invitation to take part in Climate Assembly UK.Are you pleased?

And, unlike some British indies, it never sacrifices comedy to the easier mannerism of being “dark” it just keeps being funny while at the same time weirdly touching.Maeve Higgins is tremendous as Rose, a gentle, shy soul: a driving instructor with the gift of exorcism, which she inherited from her celebrity paranormalist dad, who released a series of video guides to communicating with the beyond.

However, she accidentally killed him while acting as his incompetent assistant in the middle of a ceremony to expel a demon from someone’s dog.Convulsed with guilt, she has abandoned her supernatural vocation, but this all changes when someone needs his help: a nice, gentle widower, Martin (Barry Ward), haunted by the ghost of his stroppy late wife, and alienated from his teenage daughter Sarah (Emma Martin). To make matters worse, there is a washed-up American singing star who lives nearby, Christian Winter (played by 30 Rock’s Will Forte) who is a closet satanist and needs to sacrifice a virgin so that the Evil One can make his new album a hit – and he’s got his eye on Sarah.There’s pretty much a great line or visual gag for every minute of running time, some colossal “daemonic possession” acting from Ward that I enjoyed very much indeed.

Will I be able to make films that you can see in a cinema like this? I may have to do something else,” she said. “I think it’s a very serious moment. We have to really be awake to do something about it,” she added.Hogg was discussing the preservation and restoration work of the Film Foundation, of which she has recently been made a director. “It’s particularly timely to keep thinking about this kind of restoration work when the world of cinema is changing,” she said. “There’s a certain kind of cinema, but I’m not sure if you can call it cinema, that’s very homogenised in a way, that’s not created out of a real passion.”Hogg’s remarks echoed those of the Film Foundation’s founder Martin Scorsese, who told Empire  last month that he considered Marvel movies “not cinema” and then restated his argument in the New York Times.At the screening, Hogg suggested that stewardship of our cinematic heritage was somewhere between a moral obligation and a gift to future generations. “It would be very selfish of us not to be concerned with our culture and think of the future. It just seems incredibly careless of us not to look after an art form that’s still so young.”Ninety per cent of silent films had been lost, she added, saying: “Could we imagine not being able to read War and Peace? That we couldn’t get hold of a copy, it’s unimaginable. Or say there’s a Caravaggio that is falling apart, that’s fading, that needs work, that we would discard it? That we wouldn’t actually work to restore it?”Hogg spoke about how she was inspired to become a film director after watching classic movies on TV as a child (“I was known as square eyes”) and also by seeing arthouse cinema in London as an adult. Commentators defended Scorsese by pointing both to the work of the Film Foundation and his support of younger film-makers to demonstrate that he is actively involved in the cinema beyond his own work.The film shown at the screening, Maurice Tourneur’s 1919 drama The Broken Butterfly, was a prime candidate for a benevolent restoration – each scene picturesquely framed and delicately lit, with soft tints and illustrated intertitles. It is a poignant romantic melodrama whose plot has some jaw-dropping moments. Its now little-known stars, Pauline Starke and Lew Cody, give intensely serious performances. Hogg told the audience that the film had moved her to tears and that she had “goosebumps everywhere” while watching it.Scorsese suggested the film as a candidate for restoration – as a little-known work by a pivotal silent-era director. Tourneur was born in Paris in 1876, and began and ended his film career in France, but for several years in the 1910s and 1920s worked in the US film industry, during which time he made The Broken Butterfly.His most famous Hollywood films include the epic The Last of the Mohicans (1920) and The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), starring Mary Pickford. His cinematic legacy includes not just his own movies, but those of his son, Jacques Tourneur, who who became a Hollywood director, making the film noir Out of the Past (1947) and cult favourites such as Cat People (1942).The Broken Butterfly was restored by the Film Foundation at L’Immagine Ritrovata Laboratory in association with Fondation Jérôme Seydoux-Pathé, and was funded by cognac brand Louis XIII. Accompanied by a live improvised score by silent film pianist and composer John Sweeney, the film tells the story of a young woman, raised by a punitive aunt in a Canadian village, who falls in love with a musician who composes a symphony in her honour. As their affair takes a tragic turn, she learns a horrifying secret about her childhood.The restoration, which has cleaned up the image, reintroduced the title cards, and involved commissioning a new score, has also been screened in the US and France, will be made available online.• The Broken Butterfly will be available to watch at film-foundation.org on 14 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ece9046fb6a4283ef7fc2a87a9a0ae6d6951e438/0_819_4744_2847/master/4744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e35620a9e5ca8a6aa913ebe3034c0f09","title":"bake off winner david atherton i enjoy the buns innuendos","story":"He won GBBO with a reputation for being calm, tidy and methodical. But the star baker says in reality he’s an extrovert hippy who hasn’t washed his hair in 15 years – and another contestant tested one of his bakesHe’s the quiet, controlled one who wowed the judges with precise technical bakes. At least, that’s the impression you probably have of the 2019 Great British Bake Off winner, David Atherton. Wrong. In person, he’s an adventurous extrovert with a hippy streak. “Most of my practices I did in my pants while eating pizza and watching RuPaul’s Drag Race. The person in the edit is not me,” he says. “At the end, it showed me singing to myself and dancing around, but actually I did that the whole way through. I am calm and methodical, but I’m not particularly reserved.”Atherton’s triumph – he didn’t win a showstopper while the hotly tipped finalist Steph Blackwell was star baker four times – is all the more remarkable because he was a reserve applicant (as was his co-finalist Alice Fevronia), drafted in to replace a dropout just two weeks before the show began. Yet the 36-year-old health adviser is such an experienced and confident cook (“Ottolenghi is my absolute hero,” he says, and he is a big fan of baker Dan Lepard), he didn’t panic or even change any social plans. “The weekend before the show, I decided to cycle to Paris. It was good for my headspace.”A fitness fanatic, he had made his stunning snake cake only once before the opening show. “My thought was that if you’ve tried something and it’s worked, don’t keep on practising it, because if you try it again and it doesn’t work, it’s just going to stress you out. A lot of Bake Off is your mental strength.”He thought dessert week might be his undoing. “Sweet, fancy, fluffy desserts are not my thing. I like robust flavours and hearty bakes. I like breads. If I do a cake, I want it to be a carrot cake. If I do biscuits, I want them to be spicy.”Judge Paul Hollywood wasn’t initially a fan of his flavours. “Paul has, I think, quite simple tastes. He likes really obvious flavours – chocolate and caramel and raspberry and white chocolate and lemon.” Yet Atherton won a handshake and is happy to return the compliment: “He’s very technical. I always agreed with their constructive criticisms. He was really helpful with tips. He must enjoy teaching because he’s really good at that.”While all around him were dropping their creations or gasping as they ran out of time, the cheerful, unfazed Atherton always seemed to finish with a few moments to clean his workbench. Is he really this perfect – prissy even – in real life?Not at all. “I’m not that clean and tidy. I don’t like showering. I never wear shoes. I’ve not washed my hair in more than 15 years. I didn’t go to a hairdresser until I was about 28. I think these things are healthy.“I’m very hippy and outdoorsy. I love talking about my bowels and anything disgusting and medical.”His Bake Off persona only shows a sliver of his interests – and hardly nods to his adventures. A trained nurse, he lives in south London and works for Voluntary Services Overseas. He has a post-graduate degree in wilderness and expedition medicine. And he has travelled around Africa, living in Malawi for two years. “I left home at 18 and went to Côte d’Ivoire. I’ve been evacuated from two wars, once by the British special forces, once by the Americans. I went to Ethiopia when it was in a state of emergency and 10,000 people were arrested. I was in Nigeria during massive demonstrations and we were in lockdown for three days. I’ve had malaria nine times. I’ve been quarantined in a shack in New Guinea for a week because I got a violent strain of measles. I’ve lived in a lot of countries and I really like that adventurous lifestyle.”No wonder he didn’t flap under pressure in the tent. What about the comments that he looked arrogant? “I was never smug. You’re so nervous that whatever your face is, it’s probably just you trying to be composed. I didn’t know I pouted, but I do. Get over it.”One of five children, Atherton was brought up by strict evangelical parents in Whitby, North Yorkshire. “We weren’t allowed to watch TV. There was a period where we were allowed to watch one programme a day and you had to circle it in the Radio Times. We had breakfast every morning as a family of seven and my dad did a bible study and everyone had to pray at the end. Some of the things were so nice. We’d play board games and do crafts and cooking together. It was a very loving family and we spent a lot of time together.”His mother was health-conscious and cooked from scratch. As a result, Atherton grew up vegetarian, without a potato waffle in sight. “In our lunchbox we never had crisps or chocolate biscuits, it would be nuts and seeds. Figs and prunes would be our sweet things. Carrot sticks. We never had butter or margarine. We never had icing on our cakes.“For my mum, making bread was a way of keeping us busy. She would make the dough and we would play with it like Play-Doh. She would make rolls and we would make rabbits, cats and crocodiles.”His grandmother taught him to sew, knit and crochet. In the living room of the small flat he has just moved into with his boyfriend, Nik, he proudly shows me the practical but stylish things he has crafted: a quilt, bowls and platters (“my Ottolenghi salad plates”), a table and bench (“Honestly, it took about 20 minutes”).He met Nik, a brand manager who helps him with social media, on a dating site. They are both into fitness. “Our second date was a 100km London to Brighton bike ride. When he agreed to that, I was: ‘Brilliant, this is it.’ We did it not realising it was the big charity one, which was great because all the roads were closed.”Atherton came out seven years ago by writing to his parents. He chose this method, he says, to give them time to process the news. “The reaction that someone might have from it being sprung on them might not be the reaction they’d want to have if they’d considered it. You’ve been thinking about it for ages, but it’s new for them. I told my parents in a letter and said: ‘Speak to my twin brother before you speak to me because he wants to be able to answer certain questions first that might seem offensive to me.’ They took it very well.” He loves the fact that LGBT teenagers now contact him for advice, but is aware of the irony. “They say I’m an inspiration, but I didn’t come out until I was 29. But they’re seeing me after that, where I don’t live with shame any more. I’m really happy. Shame just eats away at you. I encourage people that the soonest time it’s right for them, they should come out, because I didn’t do that and so many people you speak to wish they’d done it earlier.”He says he was frustrated at being “a little bit objectified” early on in Bake Off – “in certain episodes, I felt like I was just a sexual innuendo” – but admits he loves the attention he has been getting since it aired. “In general, I enjoy the buns innuendos. A lot of it is really funny. I mean, I did wear tight trousers every week. It’s not like I wasn’t also playing up to this.”He would have liked to wear tight shorts and a vest, but it wasn’t allowed. “Apparently armpit hair doesn’t look nice on TV. I think it’s more health and safety, because I said I’d shave my armpits.”His admirers have certainly been upfront. There are lots of fans in the US, where the show has also aired. “The gay Brits are definitely more dirty. The Americans are: ‘You’re awesome.’ The Brits are: ‘I want to fill you with my buttercream.’ I’ve not just had dick pics, I’ve had videos of people masturbating.”Aside from the Bake Off innuendo, there were real friendships on show. Atherton, Henry Bird and Michael Chakraverty formed a “least laddy lads’ club” (with Fevronia an honorary member) that lives on through Instagram. “We would ring each other during the week as things went wrong. I’m not embarrassed to say that Henry practised one of my bakes for me – the Aperol domed tart. It was my recipe, but I didn’t have time. He’d gone out the week before and had time to do everything. He sent exhaustive notes. Every two or three minutes were accounted for.”Atherton thinks this “camaraderie between the bakers” brought a warmth to the show. “You could see that we were helping each other and people weren’t really very competitive. I think that helped, especially in the climate of ision and Brexit. I think the public have really liked that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/535c66550edac692c9c3b6fe84184085eb2ee2ab/0_1267_8815_5290/master/8815.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90864320105fd0cfe887da6f92d5de7b","title":"how to cook the perfect nasi goreng recipe","story":"Indonesian fried rice is one of the all-time great comfort foods, but has more variations than Indonesia has islands. So what’s the best recipe?Though there are many worthy contenders for the title, all right-thinking people surely agree that fried rice is the very best kind of rice. And the Indonesian version, nasi goreng, is right up there in the top tier – “one of the world’s great comfort foods”, according to Rick Stein, who developed a taste for it while filming there with a crew who apparently preferred to start the day with a full English. Jakarta-born food writer Pat Tanumihardja explains that it’s the use of kecap manis (Indonesian soy sauce) and terasi (Indonesian shrimp paste) that “sets nasi goreng apart from other fried-rice variations you’ll see in other countries”.Not that there’s just one version of nasi goreng, obviously a country made up of more than 14,000 islands contains multitudes in this respect as much as any other: there’s nasi goreng kambing with mutton, nasi goreng ayam with chicken, and nasi goreng gila, or crazy fried rice, which can apparently contain anything the cook happens to have to hand, from corned beef to sausages. But for those of us without easy access to Indonesia’s many night markets and street stalls, what’s the best way to make it at home?Clearly, the most important ingredient, and all the recipes I try call for long-grained varieties, occasionally basmati, but more often jasmine, which goes slightly sticky when cooked, making it easier to eat. That should, in theory, also make it less satisfactory for stir-frying, but actually, as long as you break up any clumps beforehand, this tacky plumpness makes for a very alluring texture. So, though you can use just about any rice you like, jasmine is my preference.The prevailing wisdom with fried rice is that you need to let the rice cool completely first, with Tanumihardja recommending using day-old rice for this purpose, and Indonesian food writer and cook Sri Owen telling readers of her Rice Book to let it cool for at least two hours before use. Some recipes, however, such as Meera Sodha’s in East, use freshly cooked rice – and, to my surprise, this works just fine. As Serious Eats’ J Kenji López-Alt, who has investigated the subject with characteristic rigour, explains, as cooked rice ages, it dries out, which means it’ll fry more quickly and is less likely to stick together – he recommends leaving it under a fan for an hour, but says even freshly cooked rice spread out on a tray to cool slightly before use is superior to drier, day-old rice, which has a tendency to go hard and chewy in a hot wok. Personally, I rather like a few rogue, crunchy grains, but still, it’s good to know that a sudden craving for fried rice isn’t necessarily a hiding to disappointment.Owen uses a mixture of oil and butter, which is hard to prevent burning at such a high heat. If you’d like butter in there – though it doesn’t seem to be common, as far as I can tell – add it at the end: a neutral oil seems the best bet for stir-frying.Almost every recipe starts with some sort of onion – whether yellow, as in Owen’s version and Eleanor Ford’s in Fire Islands red as in Sodha’s or shallots as in Rick Stein, Jennifer Joyce and Tanumihardja’s recipes – and garlic. My testers and I like the sweetness of the shallots, but red onion makes a good substitute, with some fresh spring onion stirred in at the end as in Ford, Stein and Anissa Helou’s recipes.Chillies are also vital, both medium and mild and small and vicious, though Tanumihardja suggests stirring in some sambal oelek, or tangy Indonesian chilli paste instead. Helou makes her own sambal bajak, a brick-red mixture of fried chillies, shallots, palm sugar, bay leaves, lemongrass, galangal, tamarind and nutmeg, which gives her dish a lovely, warm sweetness. Stein, meanwhile, gives us a recipe that starts with a Balinese spice paste made from pepper, nutmeg, candlenuts, sesame seeds, shallots, ginger, galangal, turmeric, (pauses for breath) lemongrass, garlic, chillies, shrimp paste, palm sugar, salt, lime juice and oil.Almost all the recipes come garnished with a fried egg (which is why nasi goreng is the best of all fried rices). But some also incorporate eggs in other forms: Grigson goes for strips of omelette, while Helou cracks an egg directly into the wok, explaining that William Wongso, Indonesia’s foremost celebrity chef, reckons it must brown on the base “to release the aroma” before adding the rice. I’m with him egg-fried rice is never a bad idea.Fried eggs are the classic choice, but sliced cucumber and tomato are also popular, the cucumber in particular adding a soothing crunch. Prawn crackers are also sometimes used as a secondary piece of cutlery. Crispy shallots, of the kind sold in south-east Asian food stores, are a great idea. Grigson’s salted peanuts and banana are perhaps more leftfield choices, but as I have not, as yet, been lucky enough to visit Indonesia, I’m unable to pronounce on their popularity in the field, so I’ll just say anchovies and banana is not a combination I’m keen to repeat.200g jasmine rice 2 tbsp neutral oil1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed2 eggs, beaten2 tbsp kecap manis2 tsp soy sauce4 spring onions1 bird’s eye chilli, sliced, to serveFor the paste50g shallots, peeled and roughly chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped2 tsp Indonesian shrimp paste (terasi)1 large medium red chilli, deseeded1 tbsp neutral oilOptional toppingsFried eggsSliced cucumber or tomatoesLightly blanched vegetablesCooked meat or seafoodCrispy shallotsSalted peanutsPut the rice in a pan with 400ml boiling water.

Stir through the sugar and flaked almonds. Sprinkle the crumble over the apple layer.Bake for about 30-40 minutes, or until the top is golden, and the apples are bubbling and soft (insert a knife to check softness).What turns this into a desert is the camels and cacti. Make the biscuits by first whisking together the butter and caster sugar until soft. Then add the flour and stir until combined into a ball of dough. Roll out on to a floured surface. Cut into cacti and cactus shapes. Ideally, use a biscuit cutter, although you can make your own template on card, then cut round this.Place on to a lined baking tray in the fridge for 20 minutes, then bake for around 10-15 minutes at 180C (160C fan)350Fgas mark 4.Whisk together the icing sugar and egg white for the royal icing (you might need a little extra icing sugaregg white to adjust the consistency). You can dye this different colours using gel food dye, and then place in piping bags and use to decorate the biscuits.Arrange the biscuits to stand up in the crumble."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a32791b23da3955af40c24c6169778881d3b84a/71_232_1964_1178/master/1964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fb3ff43d13d47334db22ff078c858a0","title":"bayern munich set sights on arsene wenger as manager after rangnick blow","story":"Arsène Wenger has emerged as the frontrunner to replace Niko Kovac as Bayern Munich’s manager after Ralf Rangnick ruled himself out. Bayern have made the Frenchman their No 1 target to take charge for the rest of the season before considering who will take over long term.Rangnick and Wenger had been the club’s top two alternatives after the sacking of Kovac on Sunday following a string of poor performances. The agent of the 61-year-old German, Marc Kosicke, said on Wednesday, however, that his client was not interested in the Bayern job. “No, Ralf Rangnick is not available,” he said. “We do not believe that what Ralf Rangnick brings is currently being sought after by Bayern. And that’s why it makes no sense to hold concrete talks.”Rangnick, who is head of sport and development at Red Bull, would like to work in England if he leaves his post.Bayern, meanwhile, are expected to start negotiations with Wenger this week, with the Frenchman having said on beIN sport recently that he would be interested in taking over. “You miss the intensity,” the Frenchman said. “There’s some things you miss a lot and some things you don’t miss. Winning football games, preparing a team for a game, developing players and getting satisfaction and shared emotions is something that you miss.“I was responsible at 33 years of age and coached until 69 without interruption at top level. That is 36 years without stopping. So on the other hand, even if I miss it, to get a little bit out of that pressure for a year was not too bad for me. People who know me well say I’m more relaxed.”The Bundesliga club would give Wenger a contract until the end of the season and then explore whether one of their long-term targets, such as Ajax’s Erik ten Hag or Paris Saint-Germain’s Thomas Tuchel, is available.Max Allegri is another name interesting Bayern in the summer but they are wary of appointing a non-German speaker after Carlo Ancelotti’s difficulties in 2016-17. Allegri, who managed Juventus between 2014 and 2019 but left last summer, may still have a chance to get the job, however, as he is represented by Giovanni Branchini, who has dealt extensively with Bayern in the past and is trusted by the club.Bayern have appointed Hansi Flick, who was Kovac’s No 2, as the interim coach. Hermann Gerland, who has previously worked under Jupp Heynckes, Louis van Gaal, Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola is the new assistant. “It was clear that I would step in out of loyalty to the club. It’s an honour, but it’s a huge challenge for me,” Flick said this week.“I want to talk to all the players and tell them again what they are capable of and what they do, and I want the team to take initiative and show their quality. We have to focus on what’s ahead.” Bayern face Borussia Dortmund in Der Klassiker on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be0b1dc034d3b584116d7bfa274f7e0b7515f199/271_59_3641_2185/master/3641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b1fb66dd1a8c2dca643c9e72ac5589e","title":"competent defending hasnt been this far out of fashion since 1925","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!On Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea and Ajax served up an instant Big Cup classic. Eight goals were scored. Two were penalties. Another two were own goals. The penalties were expertly converted, while one of the own goals twanged off someone’s big, startled, confused face in the grand music-hall manner. There was a double sending off for two separate incidents during the same passage of play, one of them a hilariously harsh handball decision. A three-goal comeback was completed in 11 minutes. A late winner got ruled out by VAR, while the side down to nine men were sending their full-backs upfield on the overlap during added time. Also, there was only one set of fans in attendance, so the whole thing was played out in a very surreal, lopsided atmosphere indeed. And they say the group stage is the boring bit.Thing is, they used to have a point. We’re only just past the halfway mark in the groups, and already we can file Tuesday night’s 4-4 alongside a 4-3, a 6-2 and that 2-7. Throw in a 6-0 and a 4-3 in Big Vase, plus last week’s preposterous 5-5 draw in the Tin Pot at Anfield, and something very strange is happening in elite football right now. Competent defending hasn’t been this far out of fashion since 1925, when the First Division was producing scorelines such as 11-2, 10-0, 1-7 (twice), 8-3 (twice), 7-3, 6-3 (five times) and 5-3 (four times). That particular carry-on was put down to confusion over the new offside law, although the contemporary half-time diet of cooking brandy, cheroots and industrial-strength speed must also have had some bearing, surely. But there are no such excuses today. We can’t even blame this on VAR, even though we’d like to. What’s going on?Whatever it is, we’re on board. And it would seem that Frank Lampard is as well, his post-match quotes suggesting he’s buying into the reckless pleasures of freewheeling fun bigstyle. “I had some mad nights over the years, but this is certainly right up there,” he grinned, feeling all warm and fuzzy. “We need to tighten up for sure, but with that spirit we can go places.” The suggestion implicit that the latter might be more important to him than the former. It’s a brave philosophy which guarantees entertainment, though not necessarily trophies. But then again what’s more important?

Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Lyon, Paris Saint-Germain, Wolfsburg, Arsenal and Atlético Madrid, the giants of women’s football are all there.The eighth team, standing strong in the face of a more and more dominant European elite are Glasgow City.Without a men’s “parent team” that their Champions League bedfellows benefit from, Glasgow City cannot come close to matching the glamour and global profile of their potential opponent. But they are a stalwart of women’s football.It is not City’s first time in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. The 14-time Scottish Women’s Premier League champions reached the same stage in 2014-15, and they have got as far as the last 16 on three other occasions.But when City were last in the final eight, European women’s football was at a very different stage of development. Then, the other teams through were Bristol Academy (who had been back under the wing of Bristol City for only a year after a seven-year spell of independence), PSG, the Swedish sides Rosengård and Linköping, Wolfsburg and Frankfurt from Germany and Denmark’s Brøndby.The change to a last eight that – Glasgow apart – would not look out of place in the men’s draw reflects the growth of women’s football. That seven of the eight nations to reach the same stage of the Women’s World Cup this summer were European is similarly telling.The big guns of football, in terms of leagues, clubs and national associations, are investing heavily – and it shows. The push for men’s clubs to pick up the women’s football banner has worked. Manchester United have entered the fold, Real Madrid have taken over CD Tacón. In many respects it would be fair to have a tinge of sadness as the teams who pioneered the game are pushed out in favour of those who have been somewhat bullied to the table, but there is no denying the impact these football giants have on the legitimacy of women’s football and the audiences they bring.Glasgow City’s stunning penalty defeat of Brøndby, who had tied the aggregate score after the Scottish club’s shock 2-0 away win, leaves them flying the flag of the little guys in Europe’s premier domestic competition.The goalkeeper, Lee Alexander, put in a player-of-the-match performance by saving three penalties in the shootout, perhaps helping to dull memories of Scotland’s crushing single World Cup point.Five of Glasgow City’s team were part of Shelley Kerr’s squad in France, and three, including Alexander, are in the squad for November’s international window.City stick out in many ways. Founded by the Scottish players Laura Montgomery (who still runs things as club manager) and Carol Anne Stewart in 1998, they remain unaffiliated to a men’s team.Last month they secured the SWPL title for a 13th consecutive season, a feat all the more impressive given the rise of Celtic and Rangers, with the former turning professional at the start of last season and the latter upping investment significantly.The head coach, Scott Booth, who has managed the team since 2015, has to balance a squad of primarily part-time players who juggle work or studying with their football, and two professional players in Hayley Lauder and Rachel McLauchlan.As a standalone women’s club full-time professionalism is out of reach at present and so their best players often graduate to clubs who can offer it. The Utah Royals defender and Scotland captain Rachel Corsie, the Arsenal defender Emma Mitchell, Chelsea’s forward Erin Cuthbert and the Wales international Denise O’Sullivan, an NWSL winner with North Carolina Courage, laid the foundations of their careers in Glasgow.Success in the Champions League can create its own problems. After City played Anderlecht last season, Abbi Grant (now at Birmingham) was poached by the Belgian side. After their defeat by Eskilstuna in 2016 Fiona Brown was recruited by the Swedish team. Their run in this year’s competition will undoubtedly attract the scouts.Now, if Scottish football wants to continue the big strides being made, and to disrupt the European narrative, they need support. Government funding helped all members of the national squad to train full-time in the run-up to their first World Cup in France. The £400,000 that remains from money generated by the tournament, after payment to players, is expected to be reinvested in the domestic game by the Scottish Football Association.But there is a long way to go. Lauder retweeted a photo of City’s title-winning 10-0 defeat of Motherwell which was played at Wishaw Sports Centre, with the added caption: “Just won a league title in a public park at a sports centre. Not how I envisaged the game in 2019. Women’s football is one of the most inclusive sports and we pride ourselves on that. However, this venue was not accessible for all our fans.” It was damning. And harked back to the conditions of games after women’s football was banned from association grounds by the SFA, as it was in England, in 1921. Hardly fitting of a showpiece title decider.Luckily for City, a tie against one of Europe’s top teams will offer a more glamorous way to continue the season. With the league wrapped up they don’t have the burden of a domestic schedule on the calendar. Despite that, avoiding defeat in either leg will be a huge struggle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c539f4d8715e818403e236bab4b50486a0cacb3/0_93_3339_2003/master/3339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62543c4d0a6239323c1220cd1305a7e","title":"reece james chelsea ajax","story":"Chelsea’s fans loved their first glimpse of Reece James. The 19-year-old right-back missed the start of the season with a foot injury, forcing him to watch from the treatment room as Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori illustrated the excellence of Chelsea’s academy, but there was no holding back once he had proved his fitness in training to Frank Lampard. James made his debut in the 7-1 Carabao Cup victory over Grimsby in September and he demonstrated his potential in style, laying on assists for Michy Batshuayi and Kurt Zouma before scoring his first goal for the club with a spectacular shot from 25 yards.That was only the start, though. Excelling against League Two opponents was one thing but the stakes were far higher when Lampard replaced Marcos Alonso with James at half-time against Ajax on Tuesday. David Neres and Hakim Ziyech had overwhelmed Alonso by doubling up on the left-back during the first half and Lampard had to act with his team trailing 3-1 at home. His response was to put James at right-back and move César Azpilicueta, who had struggled against Quincy Promes, to the left.The change worked, even though Chelsea’s hopes of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League were in severe peril when Donny van de Beek made it 4-1 to Ajax after 55 minutes. James was an energetic presence on the right flank, forcing Promes to defend more, and he was determined to take his chance. He kept driving to the byline, kept showing for the ball and kept whipping crosses into the area. There was more to his performance than the equaliser that capped Chelsea’s comeback against Ajax’s nine men.“Reece is a fantastic young player and he gives what you saw,” Lampard said. “I think he’ll get much better because he is 19 and that’s just normal. Reece can deliver crosses with great quality. He is powerful and joins in. He knows we have got Azpi there who is our captain and right-back but he knows we can change things. He is going to be a great player for this club. He’s got great quality.”Full-backs have to be attack-minded these days and while James still has to work on the defensive side of his game, there is no doubt about his threat in the final third. His technique was perfect when Kurt Zouma’s header hit the bar and the ball fell into his path. He connected firmly to send a fizzing drive through the bodies and into André Onana’s net.That nervelessness will not have come as a surprise to anyone who saw James impress on loan at Wigan last season. His performances earned him a spot in the Championship team of the season and Chelsea’s transfer ban, coupled with Lampard’s willingness to give youth a chance, meant there were high hopes when he returned to Stamford Bridge.Injury curtailed his progress, though, and Lampard backed Azpilicueta when the experienced Spaniard was struggling at the start of the season. Azpilicueta has regained his solidity in the past two months. Perhaps the captain has been given a jolt by the threat James poses to his place.Not that Azpilicueta has failed to understand his responsibilities. He has given the youngster advice and has not regarded him with suspicion. Azpilicueta smiled when asked about James before last month’s trip to Lille and suggested they play could in the same team. The following evening Azpilicueta was on the right of a back three and James was at right wing-back at Stade Pierre Mauroy.James did well that night and although he has mainly been on the bench since, he feels valued by Lampard. It means a lot to him that Chelsea’s manager has been giving him minutes at the end of league games. Just getting on the pitch shows James that Lampard trusts him, even when he is thrown on merely to help his teammates hold a slender lead.Those little tasters meant James was hungry when he came on against Ajax. He was ready to go and although he is likely to be back on the bench when Crystal Palace visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday, Chelsea know they have a star in the making."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc0005027558a0b26c50cf5a53bee359b9a12d89/299_97_2331_1398/master/2331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dadfec31e9354b11febdf5b904e4891","title":"vitoria guimaraes v arsenal europa league live","story":"The home side equalise and it’s no more than they deserve. An acrobatic finish from Duarte, whose left-footed volley leaves them in with a squeak of snatching the win with four minutes of added time to go. 90 min: Bonatini blazes over the bar to ruin Vitoria’s best move of the night. They carved Arsenal open, with Duarte and Rochinha combining to tee up the substitute with a glorious opportunity to equalise from close range.89 min: Matteo Guendouzi is felled in midfield and wins a free-kick as the clock ticks down. 86 min: Marcus Edwards has an attempted through ball into the Arsenal penalty area blocked by Holding. Assuming they fail to win, Vitoria will feel they left this one behind them tonight - they’ve had plenty of chances, but were unable to convert any of them into goals. Arsenal, by contrast, have scored with their only effort on target and look like labouring their way to victory.84 min: Rob Holding puts the ball behind for a corner after intercepting a Rafa Soares cross. The ensuing setpiece is cleared comfortably. 82 min: Arsenal score with their first effort on target, meaning Vitoria goalkeeper Douglas still hasn’t made a save. The Portuguese side make their final substitution, with Leo Bonatini, on loan from Wolves, replacing Lucas Evangelista. They must win tonight, to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages. I suspect the opportunity has passed them by. Pepe curls the ball towards the far post, where Mustafi rises highest and sends a fine downward header back across the face of goal and into the bottom left-hand corner. 80 min: Martinelli goes down under a challenge from Evangelista and Arsenal have a free-kick from about 35 yards out, well left of centre.78 min: Arsenal substitution: Lucas Torreria on for Joe Willock.76 min: Arsenal are allowed to play the ball around at the back uncontested and unpressed by any Vitoria players. They seem happy to do exactly that. And indeed, for all the penetration they’ve displayed up front they might as well just pass it around at the back. 75 min: Play resumes with a Vitoria free-kick, about 25 yards from goal in line with the left edge of the penalty area. Evangelista stands over the ball, but chips it straight into the arms of Martinez. A poor, poor effort. 72 min: Arsenal continue to dominate and create nothing. They concede a free-kick, however, when Guendouzi hauls Rochinha to the ground. He clatters into Mustafi on his way down and has to receive medical treatment. 68 min: Vitoria substitution: Davidson off, Diogo Rochinha on. Bolton fans may remember the 24-year-old Portuguese, who made four appearances for them on a loan spell from Benfica four years ago. 65 min: A comically bedraggled looking Rob Holding gets booked for a trip on Lucas Evangelista. That looked a bit harsh, as the two players crossed each other’s paths and it’s difficult to know who - if anyone - fouled who. The rain has been relentless tonight and there’s a bit of surface water on the pitch. We’re not into comedy splashing and aqua-planing territory yet, mind. 64 min: Sokratis puts a cross from the left into the stand. Vitoria substitution, halfway inside the Arsenal half. Arsenal substitution: Alexandre Lacazette comes on for Bukayo Saka.63 min: Mustafi heads over the bar from a Nicolas Pepe corner. 62 min: Vitoria substitution: the number of players on the pitch named Pepe is halved with one hoist of the fourth official’s board - Vitoria’s midfielder is replaced by Dennis-Will Poha, who is on loan at the club from Rennes. 60 min: From the edge of the penalty area, Guendouzi plays a weighted pass to the edge of the six-yard box for Nicolas Pepe to latch on to. the Frenchman is flagged for offside. 59 min: Arsenal continue to dominate possession but are doing little or nothing with it. They’ve been incredibly pedestrian tonight. 58 min: Rafa Soares hacks the ball out for a corner under pressure from Saka. The ensuing dead ball delivery is poor and Evangelista heads clear. 55 min: Kieran Tierney threads a weighted pass between two defenders for Saka to chase down the inside left channel. He’s flagged for offside but that looked very tight indeed. 52 min: Nicolas Pepe loses the ball, allowing Davidson to charge up the left flank. His attempt to square the ball across the face of the Arsenal goal is atrocious and goes wide. Arsenal substitution: Matteo Guendouzi replaces the hamstrung Dani Ceballos, who limps straight back to the dressing-room.51 min: Joe Willock tries to advance into the Vitoria penalty area, but is dispossessed by Lucas Evangelista. Arsenal are bossing this second half in the early stages, but are seriously lacking in anything resembling cutting edge.50 min: Ceballos pulls up with what looks like a hamstring injury to his left leg and signals to the bench. He then carries on, but is clutching the back of his leg. 47 min: A rogue pass to Rob Holding results in Vitoria winning the ball and Marcus Edwards galloping into the space left by the Arsenal skipper. With Ceballos racing back to provide cover, the Vitoria midfielder hesitates briefly and what looked a great chance for him to go clean through on goal goes to waste.47 min: A marauding run up the inside left from Martinelli, who plays the ball inside for Saka and runs on to collect the return pass. It’s overhit. 46 min: It continues to hammer down with rain and the confused mess that is Arsenal gets the ball rolling for the second half. There are no changes in personnel on either side.Peep! The deadline remains unbroken in Guimares, but it’s the home side who have enjoyed all the best chances. THey’ve brought several smart saves out of Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, while Arsenal have yet to test his opposite number, Douglas.44 min: Saka and Tierney both go down injured for Arsenal and Pepe is penalised for his foul on the young Scot. Free-kick for Arsenal, just outside the Vitoria box. Nicolas Pepe fires a poor effort high over the bar.42 min: Arsenal throw-in, deep in Vitoria territory as approach half-time. Holding loses the ball and Edwards surges forward. Rushing back to recover, Holding fouls his fellow Englishman. He’s fortunate to avoid a booking. 41 min: Evangelista becomes the latest Vitoria player to shoot high and wide of the Arsenal goal with a speculative shot from distance.40 min: A series of free-kicks for fouls on players from both teams has made things a little scrappy. With Davidson lurking in the penalty area, trying to get on the end of a deft little back-heel from Evangelista, Sokratis takes no chances and hacks the ball into Row Z.

It is about standing at a cabinet, hands on a robust, noisy joystick, shoulder-to-shoulder with a rival as you physically jostle for presence in a clash of skill. That is rather hard to replicate at home.You can invest a great deal of money and space into setting up original arcade hardware in your living room. Or you can settle for the legally murky world of “emulation”, running old games on a modern computer with considerable effort.Now the veteran arcade games publisher Capcom has endeavoured to provide a new way to bring an authentic arcade experience into your home. The hefty Capcom Home Arcade is a lavish dedicated console preloaded with classic games in a similar approach to the acclaimed SNES and Mega Drive mini consoles. Each of those offered a charmingly miniaturised version of a fondly remembered vintage machine, that could be plugged straight into a modern TV. The Capcom Home Arcade though, is a lot bigger – and at £200, more costly – than those.It reproduces the control panel of a traditional arcade cabinet at 1:1 scale, meaning two full-size sticks and a spread of buttons side-by-side. Deep in its guts sits all the code needed to run 16 different games. Plug it straight into your TV via an included HDMI cable, and you are ready to play.Fortunately, the Capcom Home Arcade is built from suitably high-quality parts. The sticks and buttons are made by Sanwa a brand with cult status among arcade devotees. That means you get something extremely durable, highly responsive, and very rewarding to use. The unit’s unusual looks are bound to be isive, but with eyes on the screen and hands at the controls, it is comfortable and ergonomic.Most significantly, the Capcom Home Arcade brings dazzling recreations of these classic titles via astonishingly capable emulation. Testing the system alongside original arcade hardware, they run responsively, with graceful accuracy.The 16 included titles bring a erse feast of genres and experiences, including riches such as Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting, Final Fight, Strider and Ghouls ’n Ghosts. Lesser known greats such as fighting game Mega Man: The Power Battle and 2D shooter Giga Wing demonstrate the system’s ability to serve both multiplayer and solitary sessions. And then there are masterpieces never before released to home formats: the profoundly intricate shoot-em-up Progear, and the immensely fun co-op brawler Alien Vs Predator.The home arcade can be placed on your lap, but it’s somewhat ungainly – the ideal solution is to place it on a table, which might not be feasible for many. While it makes old games look great on a present-day screen, the display options are sadly limited. Equally, many settings available in the games’ original hardware, such as customisable button layout and autofire aren’t available.All those things could be fixed over the internet with a future update. It may even be possible for Capcom to add extra games the same way. The £200 price tag remains high, but then a two-player arcade stick of this quality with no preloaded games could cost close to that amount, and securing an arcade original of just one of the featured titles would cost you much more than a couple of hundred pounds. A few nights with good friends, a big TV and several richly preserved arcade classics from the 1980s and 90s may well be worth the asking price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b089d0d5d0939056d2be35001310adc0f355895/946_287_3140_1884/master/3140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6dbc11399fe53f4ec2bdb85b23aa9ce","title":"consciously uncoupled the joy of self partnership","story":"From Emma Watson to Lizzo – the singer who puts the ‘sing in single’ – more and more people are throwing off outdated stigmas and embracing a happy life on their ownOnce upon a time we were brought up on fairytales.

Now, however, she is “very happy” to be single. “I call it being self-partnered.”The pop star Selena Gomez, meanwhile, whose single-positive songs include Lose You to Love Me and Look at Her Now, has been talking about the fun she has had as a “super, super single” woman since splitting up with Justin Bieber two years ago. On Twitter, fellow singer Ariana Grande called the time since her split with Pete Davidson “one hell of a productive, emotional, wild and yet ... happy! year”. And as for Lizzo, currently touring the UK, she is proud to say she puts the “sing in single”. As she put it in her 2017 hit Truth Hurts: “I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick … Ain’t worried ’bout a ring on my finger.”Nor is Abi Jackson, 37, who fell in love with the single life in 2015 after the end of a five-year engagement. “Focusing on what you can gain from being single rather than what you’re missing is extremely empowering,” says the London-based writer. “I took up cycling as a hobby and absolutely loved it, which I might not have discovered if I hadn’t been single and pushing myself to try new things.” She has more time to focus on relationships with friends and family, as well as community activities such as volunteering with the Scouts. “We need to start saying: ‘You are enough as a single person’, otherwise it can start to define you.”Like a growing number of single women, Jackson says she takes herself out on dates. “Some people seem to think going to the cinema or having dinner by yourself is weird, but it’s brilliant. I dress up and really make the most of my night. I won’t hide away in the corner or apologise for being on my own.” Although she hasn’t ruled out being in a relationship, Jackson says dating turned her into a caricature. “It felt like I was being reduced to funny anecdotes about bad dates and failed flings. It’s easy to become hyperaware of that fairytale narrative, especially for women, but I don’t think being single should be framed around looking for love. It’s about developing a positive relationship with yourself.”Having dabbled with dating apps since 2017, it’s a feeling with which I’m familiar. While it’s easy to meet people online, I’ve always found it hard to make a real connection. There are only so many times I can swipe left on men called Zed who pose topless in their nan’s living room. Instead of sitting through another mediocre round of drinks with a teetotal accountant preparing for his next Tough Mudder, I would rather spend time doing the things I love. Whether that’s going to the theatre, visiting the farmers’ market or creating new recipes with my pretentious, overpriced vegetables, it feels more empowering to invest in your own passions. No one wants to end up like Bridget Jones, that vodka-slurping poster child for miserable spinsters.In 2018, the author Catherine Gray published a book about how her search for happiness had led her to take a year off dating. And what did she call it? The Unexpected Joy of Being Single.Danielle Wrate, 43, an editor and publisher, is also happy on her own. “Once you’ve found a way to enjoy your own company and go out alone, it’s liberating,” she says. “The stigma of being out alone is dying out. I see lots of people doing things by themselves now. I travel alone and get the best of both worlds, because I can always join day trips when I want some company.” Wrate is part of a local group called Sinkies, which stands for Single Income, No Kids. It was set up by a single woman who wanted to improve her social life there are regular pub quizzes, hikes and Sunday lunches. “There are a lot of members and it’s open to both sexes, but only women ever turn up.”This is indeed a trend that is largely led by women. But Rob Smith, 36, who runs a property development business on the south coast of England, points out that maintaining a happy relationship with yourself is just as important for men. “I’ve been single for five years and I’m very comfortable with it. I had a job that required me to travel frequently and I value my independence, freedom and flexibility,” he says. “I wouldn’t have been able to have a lot of the experiences I have had if I was in a relationship.” However, when his family started making jokes about his single status and pressuring him to settle down, he began to internalise their negativity. “I ended up going on a dating spree to try and find someone, which made me really unhappy.”After some soul-searching, he came to the conclusion that he was happier alone than trying to force a romance out of thin air. “I deleted all the apps and decided to go back to enjoying my single life.” He confronted his relatives about the comments they had been making, and asked them to respect his decision to be single. “I don’t think there’s as much pressure on men to settle down as there is for women, but it definitely exists. I’m very happy with my life and I needed my family to understand that.”Although he is open to the idea of having his own family in future, he says it will not affect his happiness. “Men are lucky because they have the option of having children much later,” he says. “I suppose that might be an added challenge for women.”According to Paul Dolan, a behavioural scientist from the London School of Economics, traditional benchmarks of adulthood such as marriage and children don’t always correlate with increased happiness. In fact, research included in his latest book, Happy Ever After, shows that women who remain single and child-free actually live longer, happier and healthier lives. Yet negative stereotypes about single women in particular can be pernicious. “Look at how Jennifer Aniston was portrayed for years,” says Jackson. “She was on the cover of every magazine as the woman who couldn’t get a man. The reality is she’s beautiful, successful and has an incredible life. She never needed our pity – and nor do other single women.”To reflect that reality, Nicola Slawson, 35, a journalist from Shropshire, set up the Single Supplement, a newsletter for single women. “A lot of the content aimed at women is condescending and negative,” she says. “It’s all about what to do with your partner or how to get a partner if you don’t have one. The assumption that being in a relationship is the norm is really infuriating. So I aim to write about the things that really matter to single women – everything from self-acceptance to practical issues like money management on a single income.”Like Wrate, Slawson is an advocate of solo travel. “I was advised against going to Morocco by myself as a single woman,” she says. “But I went anyway and had one of the best experiences of my life. You have to be careful, of course, but don’t let other people’s assumptions and ideals put you off doing something you want to do.”For others, a positive approach to singledom involves more than travelling alone or taking themselves out on dates. In 2015, Sophie Tanner, a digital consultant from Brighton, decided to embrace “sologamy”, the act of marrying oneself. “It was a slightly tongue-in-cheek statement against the stigma of being single. But people were incredibly supportive and took it seriously.” Tanner’s spiritual ceremony, which was presided over by a friend, was followed by a reception with her friends and family. By prioritising her relationship with herself, she says, she has developed as a person and found greater self-acceptance and happiness. “It was great to celebrate, because unless you marry or have children, there are no opportunities to celebrate your own happiness in adult life.”This year Tanner released her novel Reader, I Married Me, loosely based on her experiences of sologamy. “It’s an anti-romcom, where the character embraces the power of being on her own,” she says. Although she believes romantic love can bring happiness, Tanner maintains that having a positive relationship with yourself is more important. “It feels like there are more couples who are settling than those who are truly compatible. People could surprise themselves by realising how happy they could be on their own.”In a world geared up for couples, it’s easy to subscribe to the sad-single-female rhetoric that society thrusts in our direction. I was heartbroken when I split up with my last boyfriend after 16 months, but I quickly realised it saved me from the type of mediocre relationship that Tanner describes. Except for the days where I’m waging a one-woman war against a fitted sheet, I’m now much happier on my own.“As a society we are obsessed with finding the One,” Tanner says. “We tend to believe we can’t be fully happy unless we have that, which is just not true. It’s not the norm for people to find their soulmate, but because we put so much pressure on the importance of being with someone, people lower their expectations or put up with average or even toxic relationships.” Now 40, Tanner loves having time for her hobbies. “I enjoy solitude I love reading, writing and walking my dog by the sea.” She doesn’t get lonely. “Loneliness is an emotional response to feeling unloved and unseen, which can happen in or out of a relationship. It’s about feeling misunderstood or lacking connection. Happy solitude means you are comfortable in your own skin.”She says she is not bothered by the thought that she may never have children. “You don’t have to have children to complete you, in the same way that you don’t need a partner.”All you need, in fact, is self-belief. “I don’t see the point in apologising for existing as a single woman or sitting around feeling like I am waiting for my life to start,” says Slawson. “I just want to get out there and live it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af628bf8287019b88d9c70c845ccf8084b89e195/437_572_2670_1602/master/2670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b6ca4025652783009e5908c8516ae08","title":"have you seen any uk political adverts without disclosures on social media general election","story":"During the general election campaign we would like to hear about the political adverts you have seen on social media From 22 November political adverts will be banned on Twitter, however, other social media platforms such as Facebook will still allow them on their sites.Ahead of the UK general election we would like you to help us collect examples of political adverts running on social media which do not mention who has sponsored them.Political adverts on Facebook should clearly state who has paid for them in their posts.However, commercial adverts do not say who they are “paid for by” but only show that they are sponsored.If you have seen any political content on social media that does not clearly state who has paid for it we would like to hear from you.If you see an advert that does not say “paid for by” screenshot it.

However, an email later came to light calling into question whether Cairns knew England could be in trouble over his actions.Cairns sent a letter to Johnson on Wednesday saying he was confident he would be cleared by any investigation into his behaviour, but he was stepping down because it was such a “sensitive matter”.Johnson thanked Cairns for his role in abolishing toll charges on the Severn Bridge and his “unstinting record of service for the party in Wales”.However, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said the prime minister should prevent Cairns from standing again to be an MP.“First of all, there’s a victim here,” he told broadcasters after a speech in Telford. “That victim needs to be apologised to and needs to be supported.“Secondly, if he’s resigning because of his behaviour and involvement in this as the secretary of state then shouldn’t he also be resigning as a Conservative party candidate in the election? That’s my question.“Obviously, legally he can stand as a candidate, but does he have a moral right to stand as a candidate? If he’s stepping down as a minister because of his involvement then I would have thought the very least the Conservative party can do is not put him up as a candidate in the next election.”Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and a former director of public prosecutions, said: “He is right to resign but he has got to face an investigation. This is a very, very serious issue. It goes well beyond a ministerial investigation. Resigning was right to do but it is not enough on its own.”Wales is full of key target leave-voting seats that Johnson needs to win to secure a majority.On Tuesday, BBC Wales published an email it said was sent to Cairns by his special adviser, Geraint Davies, more than a year earlier, in which Davies wrote: “I have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court.”The email was sent on 2 August 2018, the BBC reported. Four months later, England was selected as the Welsh Conservative candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan for the 2021 Welsh assembly election. He was later suspended after being accused by a judge of deliberately sabotaging the rape trial. The rape victim is among those who called for Cairns to resign.On Wednesday, Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister and Labour leader in Wales, said Cairns’ position was another example of the Conservative party’s arrogance. He said it stood beside remarks by Jacob Rees-Mogg about the Grenfell fire and comments from a Tory candidate in Gower, south Wales, suggesting people on the reality TV show Benefits Street needed “putting down”.Christina Rees, the shadow Welsh secretary, said Cairns’ decision to step down from the cabinet was “far from the end of the matter, and is a shoddy halfway house that will fool nobody”.She added: “He has still not explained his behaviour and still not addressed the grave issues raised by the leaked emails yesterday. Worse still, neither he nor any senior Welsh Tory have apologised to one person who most deserves it: the victim herself. He should do the right thing: apologise, and step down as a candidate.”Speaking after a visit to a factory in Watford, Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “It’s right that he’s resigned. The allegations that were made are incredibly serious and I think there are real questions to be asked about why it’s taken him so long to come to this conclusion, and why he said the things he did before. I imagine as time goes on we’ll find out the answers to some of those questions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31ad43bb64ea57dd366faba8ad9bf190eafe99e5/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=283fe419adda20421ada54c3e5c346dc","title":"tough start for the tories politics weekly podcast","story":"Heather Stewart is joined by Katy Balls, Anoosh Chakelian, and Jon Mellon of the British Election Study to discuss how everyone’s general election campaigns have gone so far.

Boris Johnson launched the Conservative campaign in a newspaper, likening Jeremy Corbyn to Joseph Stalin in a slightly odd comparison.

It’s an ode to optimism, says playwright Neil BartlettThere cannot be many successful playwrights comfortable with the possibility that their work might play to an empty house. But Neil Bartlett insists he doesn’t mind if he is the only audience member during parts of his 24-hour verbatim piece when it premieres in Manchester this Remembrance Sunday. “Even if there is no one there at 4.30am, it doesn’t matter,” he said, grappling with a 572-page script of 200,000 words backstage at the Royal Exchange last week. “We will be there, bearing witness.”24 Hours of Peace is quite rightly described in the publicity as an “epic”, which reproduces the thoughts and ideas of 100 people working for peace across the UK – from diplomats to army veterans, one-time neo-Nazis to campaigners against domestic violence. It will begin at 11am with the national two minutes of silence, and will then run round the clock until 11am on Monday.The performance is free and you can’t book. “Stay for 10 minutes, stay for the whole 24 hours and bring a sleeping bag if you want,” said Bartlett. If you can’t get to the Royal Exchange, the whole marathon will be broadcast live on Resonance FM. Afterwards, the source interviews, as well as a recording of the whole production, will be archived at the British Library as a record of how we view peace in 2019.To compile the work, Bartlett spent the last six months travelling up and down the country asking the same questions: what is peace, what does it look like and how are we going to get it?Interviewees included Nigel Bromage from the Small Steps education charity, who joined the far right aged 15 and now uses his experience to teach schoolchildren about radicalisation Jasvinder Sanghera, who campaigns against forced marriage and Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s chief Northern Ireland negotiator in the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement.He spoke to veterans from the anti-nuclear women’s protest at Greenham Common as well as Erinma Bell, a mother from Moss Side in Manchester, who began campaigning against violence after witnessing a shooting and the Scottish National Party MP Steven Gethin, who after the collapse of communism had a job rounding up Kalashnikovs in the former Soviet Union.War overshadows peace, said Bartlett. “Even a very small child could describe to you what a war looks like. But we don’t have a sense of the reality of peace. Immediately we do go for abstract nouns.” Serenity, quiet, harmony: unlike the concrete language of the guns, bombs and tanks of war. “It started to really bother me, so I decided to travel around the country talking to people whose business is peace.”The work does not tell the audience how to think. “It’s not advocating or preaching a particular point of view,” insists Bartlett. “It’s not a play. It’s not saying: ‘Lights down, this will all be over in an hour-and-a-half, now I have something to tell you.’ It’s saying: if you want, as part of your Remembrance Sunday to be with us, or to tune in with us and to listen to these voices and these stories, then, come. Share the space with us.”The Royal Exchange is a fitting place to explore peace, having been half destroyed by an IRA bomb in 1996 and then rebuilt at a cost of £32m. “It’s perfect. It’s a bombsite,” said Bartlett. “The question Remembrance Sunday asks us is: do you solve problems by bombing things or building things? And this building has seen both of those things happen.”Programming the 24 hours has posed a particular headache for the company manager, said Bartlett. “You don’t want to see their spreadsheet as to who is sleeping where. Some people are doing a spot at 5pm and are back on at 4am and are back to finish the show. But we think we have worked it out so that everyone who needs a kip will get one either in a hotel nearby or in a dressing room.”The last time Bartlett stayed up all night was 25 years ago at a party on Fire Ireland, the gay enclave in New York state. “I’m 61 now. Once we’ve watched the news, my husband and I are ready for bed,” he laughed. “I’ve never been into drugs so all-nighters were never a big thing for me. If you see me backstage, please pass me another double espresso regardless of the time.” That said, he has form as far as lengthy theatrics go, having once read out Oscar Wilde’s 55,000-word De Profundis on the site of what was once Reading jail, not taking a toilet break for over six hours.Bartlett came away from his interviews with a profound sense of optimism. Powell in particular persuaded him that “no conflict is insoluble”. People often talk as if some conflicts can never be solved, whether that’s in the Middle East, or around gender-based violence or Islamophobia, but that’s not true, he said. “I grew up in the 1970s and 1980s, and I was told that the killing in Northern Ireland was merely the expression of an intractable and insoluble cultural ide. It’s not true. We did it. And all of these people are doing it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7ae28aeedac919414655996726c1d012b54a64f/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f925c056a72651eef6babdc510430714","title":"tips vintage shopping europe uk win 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"Into 50s clothing , 80 mags or 70s soul on vinyl?

His retrospective will be published by Siedl in 2020, with an accompanying exhibition at CO BerlinI moved to East Berlin, from Dresden, at the end of the 1970s. I lived in Prenzlauer Berg for most of my time there, on different streets – Kastanienallee, Winsstrasse, Choriner-Strasse. It was one of the most interesting places to be for an artist, because all the activists and dissidents were there, too. We could squat the houses, or at least not pay much rent, because they were all in such bad condition and the landlords were (mostly) happy just to have someone in there who could maintain them. Those in power, including the Stasi, were confused by our scene as they couldn’t access it, or at least not completely. There were lots of small groups rather than one big scene.It was a real community back then but the photography style I used was, of course, challenging. Not just because the Stasi were always breathing down my neck but because if I turned up at an event with my camera equipment people would often think I was with the Stasi! I always tried to wave conspicuously to the right people, to reassure everyone that I wasn’t working for them. My long hair helped.One of the worst experiences I had during those years, though, was not down to the Stasi or being a photographer: it was when I had to do army service as a reservist. I was a single parent and they put my eight-year-old daughter in an orphanage for six months. This was a heavy time as I knew she was unhappy, and I was too.Harald recommends The Volksbühne theatre, which was active during the GDR era. Tierpark Berlin is a great zoo in the East, and the Turkish Market on the Maybachufer has a great atmosphere.Born in London, Berlin resident since 2007. Co-founder Bildband BerlinI first arrived in Berlin in 1985, when I was 24. It was to visit a friend from London who was living on Sonnenallee in West Berlin. Their place was cheap: it had a shared toilet in the hall and was just a couple of blocks from the Wall. Somehow it seemed impolite to go and stare at the Wall it was something everyone had to deal with but tried to ignore.I took a couple of trips into the East on a 24-hour visa, crossing at Friedrichstrasse. It mostly reminded me of the London I had grown up in: bomb sites and patched-up buildings, and the way communal space was shared. I visited again in January 1989, as a photojournalist covering the Festival of Political Songs, and met a Hungarian who showed me how to lose my Stasi minder, and I hung out with him and his East German mates for a few days. I actually watched the Wall come down from London. By the time I got back to Berlin for Christmas 1990 it was the middle of a very cold winter and there was just a space where the Wall had been. Instead of taking hours to get through the checkpoints, you could just cross the road and be in a different city, a parallel universe. I don’t think anyone was ready for that.Joe recommends The Russian memorial at Treptower Park, the flea markets in Spandau and Marzahn, the Berlinische Galerie, CO Berlin photo gallery, 8mm Bar, Bar Tomsky, Dream Baby Dream bar. My favourite place in the world though is the Plötzensee boathouse cafe, near my studio in Wedding.Born and lives in Berlin, where she runs We Are Not Alone raves at GriessmuehleI was sleeping when the Wall fell. I didn’t believe the news at first but then I got out of bed, turned on the TV and started to cry. Even as a child, I always felt that my friends and I were somewhat imprisoned in West Berlin. There was always a strong military presence in the city: tanks on the streets, allied military exercises. My family was also separated by the Wall: one part living in the West, the rest in the East.If I wanted to visit my relatives in East Berlin, I had to go through the border crossings, which were always strictly controlled and always frightening. So, when the Wall came down, it gave me a real sense of freedom that I can still feel within me today. Initially, it meant I could discover the eastern part, which was around the same time the club scene exploded. My circle of friends changed within two years and my future from that point on was music. I started playing in those early clubs like Tresor and E-Werk. Ever since, techno has been something emotional for me, not just a short-lived trend it represents a special time and a permanent feeling in my life.Ellen recommends My favourite restaurant is Prater in Prenzlauer Berg because it still has such an original look and atmosphere. I also enjoy going to (and not just playing at) clubs such as Griessmuehle and Berghain. A cafe favourite s is Altes Europa in Mitte’s Gipsstrasse, which was also around before the fall of the Wall.Born in the US, Berlin resident since 1987, co-creator of Love Parade, which ran from 1989 to 2010I came to West Berlin in 1987 and was blown away at how it was cheap but also safe – a rare combination at that time, especially coming from New York. A friend was already living there, and the first place I found was a huge loft space, which I shared. It cost me around 30 marks a month (which would be about €15 today). The film Wings of Desire had just been released and I had watched it the night before leaving. It felt like pretty much everyone from the movie was living in or passing through this loft: musician Roland Wolf, Nick Cave and other members of the Bad Seeds, members of Einstürzende Neubauten. I thought I’d died and gone to heaven.A year later, I started dating Dr Motte, with whom I started the Love Parade. Our apartment was on what is now Axel-Springer-Strasse and the front door was a few metres from the Wall. In fact, the kitchen window looked over the Wall, and there was a watchtower opposite, so we had to buy net curtains to stop them peeking in. In the winter of 1989 I left Berlin for a performance in Austria. Motte, who is a Berliner, called in tears while I was there, to tell me the Wall was down. I arrived back in Berlin the morning after, about 7am. It had snowed and there was no one at the checkpoints. I waited for half an hour anyway, as normally you had to stop or get shot, and we didn’t know if the guards might be hiding. Afterwards, they pulled up a piece of the Wall outside our house and we walked right into East Berlin and started to discover the streets, and all the empty buildings.Danielle recommends The Mauerpark flea market. Berlin was one of few places back in the 80s that had good flea markets, and every time I go I get that feeling of the old Berlin. The karaoke singing there in the summer is great, too. I also like Arkaoda, a club in Neukölln that’s Turkish-run and is multicultural the music director also runs the amazing Fusion festival. For restaurants, try Kopps, a vegan spot that has a delicious Saturday and Sunday buffet.German-born, Berlin resident since 1990I came to Berlin from a town near Hamburg. The Wall had just fallen, which made it the most fascinating German city to live in, and I had just finished school and had family and friends here. The idea was to study but I soon got caught up with different projects, mostly organising concerts at the venues that were popping up around Mitte – Tacheles, Schokoladen, IM Eimer, ACUD – but also theatre and spoken word, too. There was a lot of crossover between disciplines as well as people in those days.The scene didn’t feel small but everyone still seemed to know each other. We were all living and running the houses we lived in, fixing the toilets and painting the windows instead of paying rent. My favourite part was working with the bands from the former Soviet bloc. We’d work with all the local venues to arrange a kind of mini-tour for them in Berlin, to justify them coming. As well as a lot of great punk and folk music, we also had amazing conversations that it hadn’t been possible to have before. This community feel was really special. There was a sense of belonging to the city. It wasn’t about money. I don’t think that exists in the same way anymore.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Democratic governor Ralph Northam will now have scope to press ahead with legislation such as tighter gun control in the state.“I’m here to officially declare today, November 5 2019, that Virginia is officially blue,” Northam, told a crowd of supporters in Richmond.In Kentucky, which Trump won by nearly 30 percentage points in the 2016 election, Andy Beshear – the Democratic challenger to unpopular incumbent governor Matt Bevin – declared victory as he was narrowly ahead of the Republican, who has refused to concede in a race that was still too close officially to call on Wednesday morning.“Tonight voters in Kentucky sent a message loud and clear for everyone to hear. It’s a message that says our elections don’t have to be about right versus left, they are still about right versus wrong,” Beshear said.The brightest spot for Republicans came was in the Mississippi’s governor’s race, where Democrat Jim Hood, the state’s attorney general, ran a competitive, but ultimately unsuccessful, race against Republican Tate Reeves, the lieutenant governor.Yet a year before the presidential election, the results offered warning signs for both parties. Voters in suburban swaths of Kentucky and Virginia sided with Democrats, a trend that would complicate Trump’s path to re-election in 2020 if it holds. And the Democrats who made gains in Tuesday’s election did so by largely avoiding positions such as the government-run healthcare plan “Medicare for All” that have animated the party’s left flank in the Democratic presidential primary race.The elections also offered insight into Trump’s popularity among Republicans as he battles an accelerating impeachment inquiry. Democratic-aligned groups pumped huge amounts of money into the contests as a way to test-drive messaging and campaigns ahead of the 2020 election, particularly on gun control and clean energy.But Bevin, who took the stage at the Republican party across town, called it a “close, close race” and said he was not conceding “by any stretch”. “We want the process to be followed, and there is a process,” he said.Bevin was elected in 2015 and had portrayed this election as a referendum on Trump, who stumped for the governor at a rally in Kentucky on Monday night and called Beshear “too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous”.At the rally, Trump told the crowd: “If you lose, it sends a really bad message … you can’t let that happen to me.”Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, sought to frame the Kentucky outcome as a net positive for Trump. “The president just about dragged Gov Matt Bevin across the finish line, helping him run stronger than expected in what turned into a very close race at the end.”In a late-night tweet after results came in, Trump appeared to concede the Republican may have lost: “@MattBevin picked up at least 15 points in last days, but perhaps not enough (Fake News will blame Trump!).”A bullish Bevin had told the New York Times last month that he anticipated winning the election by between six and 10 points.“I think you’re going to be shocked at how uncompetitive this actually is,” he told the paper at the time.Beshear, the state’s attorney general and the son of Kentucky’s last Democratic governor, made public education the cornerstone of his campaign, choosing a public high school assistant principal as his running mate and accusing Bevin of bullying schoolteachers who protested against proposed pension reforms.Bevin, who accused protesting teachers of acting “thuggish” and said school closures as a result of their actions would lead to children suffering sexual abuse and ingesting poison, said he did not regret his words. Beshear promised he would never bully anybody as governor.Bevin, meanwhile, fought on broader, national and cultural issues, highlighting his relationship with Trump and his support for the second amendment, while touting himself as the “most pro-life” governor in America.While Bevin performed well in much of the state, in parts of Kentucky’s largest city, Louisville, one could drive by dozens if not hundreds of “Stop Bevin – Vote Beshear!” yard signs before passing any sign of support for the Republican.At the Democrats’ election party at an event center in the predominantly African American Louisville neighbourhood of Smoketown, the mood turned from nervous to jovial as returns showed Beshear taking the lead.“We’re off the bus, Bevin is out of here,” said Jennifer Leano, 49, as she left the Beshear celebration. “After he insulted the teachers, Bevin dug his own grave.”Kentucky’s race was one of several closely watched elections in states across the US on Tuesday. Republican Daniel Cameron made history in a resounding win in Kentucky’s election for attorney general, becoming the first African American to win the office.Trump rallied Republican voters on Twitter but stayed out of Virginia, which he lost in 2016.Democrats have pledged that when they take power, they will pass an agenda that Republicans have blocked for years, including stricter gun laws, a higher minimum wage and ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc4af41d26e880dfbfcde311ac3ab56bddaad2de/0_0_6493_3898/master/6493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee540c9ddcf9afc37fdfd80e9230fe3d","title":"brazil flat earth conference terra plana","story":"A first-ever conference in São Paulo will mark a high point for a theory that has thrived under the far-right President BolsonaroSiddhartha Chaibub’s suspicions that the Earth wasn’t really round were first aroused when he stumbled across a YouTube video while living in Brazil’s capital, Brasília.“I was always very sceptical about things,” said the 35-year-old freelance designer, who soon ed deep into the flat Earth universe: reading, watching videos and joining a dedicated WhatsApp group.By the end of 2015, he was convinced. “The model that is imposed on us – that the Earth is spherical – is full of contradictions,” he said.Today, his YouTube channel Professor Terra Plana (Flat Earth Professor) – featuring videos such as “25 examples that prove Nasa is a fraud” and “gravity doesn’t exist” – has nearly 29,000 subscribers.Last week, Chaibub and three of his flat Earth fellows got their biggest break yet when they appeared on the country’s most-watched talkshow, The Night, to promote Brazil’s first ever flat Earth convention this Saturday in São Paulo.The location of the event will only be disclosed on the day, organizers say, for security reasons. “There is a lot of prejudice,” said ChaibubCritics attribute Brazil’s most recent flat Earth craze to poor public education, copycatting from abroad and to the increase in social media use.“The internet gives a voice to these idiots,” said Fernando Lang da Silveira, a professor of physics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil.He said that like climate change denial and creationism, flat Earth theory had a base of Christian fundamentalism.In Brazil, the power and influence of the evangelical Christian church has grown significantly in recent decades: around a quarter of the population identifies as evangelical and these voters played a large part in bringing the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro to power.Chaibub, who says he is a Catholic, admits that part of flat Earth culture is influenced by Bible verses, but denied that the movement is religious – or political.Accusations of links to the flat Earth movement have dogged Bolsonaro’s government.In January, the science minister, Marcos Pontes – South America’s first astronaut – said that he felt a “knot in the stomach” when he heard suggestions that the Earth is flat.But just a few months later, Olavo de Carvalho – a former astrologer who is considered the intellectual guru of Bolsonaro and his inner circle – prompted outrage and ridicule when he tweeted: “I didn’t study the subject of the flat Earth. I just watched a few videos of experiments that show that aquatic surfaces are flat – and so far I haven’t found anything to refute them.”Carvalho – who has also claimed Pepsi was sweetened with aborted foetuses and that oral sex can cause cancer – dined with Bolsonaro and Steve Bannon in Washington during the Brazilian president’s state visit to the US in March.When questioned about flat Earthism, the foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo – an Olavo disciple who believes climate change is a Marxist plot – also seemed sympathetic to the movement, saying: “For me, the Earth is round. But it’s important to have this spirit of questioning,”Brazil abounds in folk legends, and has long been home to a thriving subculture of new-age truth-seekers and UFO-spotters.One of the country’s most popular authors, Paulo Coelho, claims to have had “experiences” with aliens “more than once” – although he recently clarified to the BBC that he knew the Earth wasn’t flat.Marcelo Gleiser, a Brazilian professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College in the United States and winner of this year’s Templeton Prize, described the resurgence of the theory as “very sad”.“We’re living in very strange times. The idea of being popular for being outrageous is coming from the leadership,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f2b2a6d5f2b4d6694291214108da788f835ea7a/5_573_3105_1863/master/3105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc0e568dfdf22381569af1ad65fe61f7","title":"donald tusk tipped to take charge of eu centre right group","story":"Outgoing EU council leader’s new role could set up clash with Hungary’s Viktor OrbánDonald Tusk is tipped to take charge of Europe’s biggest centre-right political group, setting up a potential conflict between the outgoing EU council president and Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán.Tusk, a former Solidarity activist who became democratic Poland’s longest-serving prime minister, is widely expected to be elected president of the European People’s party (EPP), the centre-right alliance that brings together the parties of Angela Merkel, Jean-Claude Juncker and Leo Varadkar.If confirmed, he would inherit the delicate task of handling Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party. Fidesz is officially suspended from the EPP over Orbán’s restrictions on courts, NGOs and independent media in Hungary, and impatience is mounting over the delay in taking a decision on its long-term future in the group.Although Tusk has not confirmed his EPP candidacy, he is currently the only known name in the race. With nominations closing on 13 November, he is widely expected to succeed the retiring EPP president, Joseph Daul, when delegates cast their votes at the group’s annual congress on 20-21 November.Tusk, who stands down as EU council president at the end of November, announced on Tuesday he would not run in Poland’s presidential race in May 2020, opening the door for him to take another European role.Arguably Poland’s best-known politician on the international stage, Tusk had been widely believed to be eyeing a domestic political comeback. But he told Polish media on Tuesday that “after deep consideration” he had decided not to run for president, saying his party needed a candidate “not burdened by the baggage” of difficult and unpopular decisions.As Poland’s prime minister from 2007-14, Tusk pushed through an increase in the retirement age, a measure later reversed by the current nationalist government. Critics on the left have accused Tusk’s Civic Platform party of opening the door to populists by ignoring voters’ bread-and-butter concerns during its time in office.Polish media reported that Tusk had been disappointed by the results of private opinion polling on his chances in the election.One of the most pressing tasks for the EPP president will be handling an internal inquiry into the rule of law in Hungary. More than seven months and one European election campaign after the EPP set up a three-man committee on the subject, no conclusions have been published.As European council president since 2014, Tusk has not hidden his concern with political changes in Hungary and in his native Poland. A speech last November was widely seen as aimed at Orbán, although no names were named.“If you are against the rule of law and independent judiciary, you are not a Christian Democrat,” Tusk said. “If you don’t like the free press and NGOs, if you tolerate xenophobia, homophobia, nationalism and antisemitism, you are not a Christian Democrat.”The speech came soon after the Central European University announced it had been thrown out of Hungary by the government. The university was founded by the Hungarian-born philanthropist George Soros, who has been demonised in official government campaigns with antisemitic undertones.The Hungarian government has firmly rejected charges of eroding democratic norms, most prominently at a meeting of EU ministers in September. The government has also sharply denied claims of antisemitism.Other senior EPP figures have spent years arguing that Orbán - “an enfant terrible”, in the words of Daul - should stay inside the EPP to encourage him to change and avoid boosting Eurosceptics.

But there is one thing that their pitch has in common: exam results.And a question often at the forefront of parents’ minds is:  Will it be worth it?With fees rising year on year, how do you know if a school is good value for money? Using information from the Independent Schools Council (ISC) as well as our own research and analysis, we have compiled a comprehensive database of private schools’ fees mapped against exam results.Find your schoolOur interactive tool allows you to search for every school in England  - where their GCSE results are publicly available - and see how they fare against others in terms of value for money. Hovering over a diamond on the graphic brings up the school’s name as well as its fees per term and the proportion of grades which were awarded As and A*, or grades 7 to 9, in GCSEs or iGCSEs in 2019.Independent schools value for money - GCSE day (behind subwall)How it worksToday we are publishing the data for GCSE results and next month we will do the same for A-level results.We have created one graphic for day schools and another for boarding schools which generally charge higher fees. Schools which have both day and boarding provision will appear in both graphics, with the appropriate level of fees reflected in each one.Independent schools value for money - GCSE boarding (behind subwall)What we foundParents are paying more than £27,000 a year to send children to a private school where just 12 per cent of their GCSE exams will be awarded top grades, according to our analysis.Bellerbys College London, which charges £9,020 per term for day pupils, has emerged as one of the most expensive day schools in the country but where pupils achieve among the lowest proportions of As and A*s, or grades 7-9, in GCSEs compared with other fee-paying institutions.  Among the most costly boarding schools was DLD College in London, where fees are £17,666 a term but just 28.07 per cent of GCSEs are awarded top grades.The college was established in 1931 to provide tutoring for prospective applicants for Oxford and Cambridge universities, as well as those preparing for Colonial Service entrance exams.Search for the best independent schools for GCSE resultsA-level grades versus fees - find out how leading private schools rank​The real reasons girls are outperforming boys at school​Meanwhile, Badminton School was identified as one of the best value boarding schools as it had one of the highest proportion of top exam grades but among the lowest fees.At the all-girls school in Bristol, which charges £5,475 a term for day pupils and £10,765 for boarders, 77 per cent of pupils achieved A-A*s or 7-9s in their GCSEs this year.Rebecca Tear, the headteacher, said that her pupils do not just “jump through exam board hoops”, but get a “hands-on” approach to their education. “It’s all about community here,” Mrs Tear said.  “Within the community the girls know one another, the older and younger girls, they know the teachers, and you’ve got really strong relationships both in and out of the classroom.“I really strongly believe that to learn, you have to be a little bit uncomfortable, you have to go through your comfort zone and push yourself.  Here, because we’re all so familiar, they are prepared to take those risks, to ask their teachers and ask each other.”The school, which was founded in 1858, counts Indira Gandhi, the first female Prime Minister of India and the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnae.Badminton School in Bristol counts the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnaeWinchester College, Charterhouse and Wellington College were among the top five most expensive day schools.Winchester College, an all-boys school which charges £13,304 per term, had the best results out of the three with 87.3 per cent of GCSEs awarded top grades. Private schools have come under pressure in recent years for hiking fees. “The danger the sector is in is that it has lost the middle class,” said Martin Stephen, the former headmaster of St Paul’s Boys’ School.“Part of the reason is as simple as the fact that they have been able to put the fees up and not reduce the number of applicants.”At Winchester College,  87.3 per cent of GCSES were awarded AA* or 7-9 this yearBarnaby Lenon, the chair of the ISC and a former headmaster at Harrow School, agreed that the biggest threat for private schools is “if they don’t hold their fees down”.He said: “Although it is true that the average fee has risen faster than salaries  - which is not a good thing - nevertheless there are still a pretty large number of schools with fees around £14,000.“Secondly now many more women work so there is more money available to pay fees than in the old days when often mother did not work. Schools have greatly increased the number of bursaries which are available for families who can only afford half or three quarters of a fee.“I totally agree that independent schools have to watch out that they don’t price parents out of the market, they are very aware of that and have made a huge effort to hold fees down.”Mr Lenon said there had been a growing realisation among parents that the relationship between exam results and success in life is not as strong as people once thought. He explained that with half the population now going to university, the premium attached to it has been slightly reduced. And with the growing number of problems with pupil mental health, this is something parents care about more, he said. Let\u0027s face it if you ask parents what they want most for their children, the first thing they will say is not results. It\u0027s that they are happy, make good friends, are safe and secure.Barnaby Lenon is a former headmaster at Harrow SchoolBellerbys College and DLD College both said that the majority of their pupils are from outside of the EU, and do not speak English as a first language.“Arrival at Bellerbys is often their first time away from home, meaning they have to make academic, cultural and language adjustments,” a spokesman for Bellersby College London said.“We specialise in caring for these young adults, tutoring them and preparing them for university entry and the future world of work. 399 of our 2019 graduates progressed to a top 50 UK university.

with grim results for any relatively well-off rural family. Anyone who used hired labour, owned a dairy, or was suspected of being a grain speculator, reasoned Lenin, could be accused of being part of the rural Bourgeoisie - and therefore an enemy of the revolution. In 1918, during the bloody civil war that followed the revolution, Lenin himself infamously ordered party officials in Penza to hang (absolutely hang, in full view of the people) no fewer than one hundred known kulaks, filthy rich men, bloodsuckers.But it was in 1929, when Stalin announced the liquidation of the Kulaks as a class, that the term became synonymous with Soviet terror. Over the next two years, around 1.8 million kulaks were deported to Siberia, Kazakhstan, and the Urals and several hundred thousand shot. Meanwhile, millions of peasants were stripped of their property and forced onto state-run collective farms. This brutal act of classicide was part of a collectivisation campaign that destroyed the agricultural economy and sparked an artificial famine that killed millions of people in Ukraine and other grain producing areas of the Soviet Union. The policy was so obviously destructive that many historians believe mass starvation was a goal - not a side effect - of the campaign. In Ukraine, it is considered a genocide. Interestingly, not everyone in the Communist Party was keen on the idea. What might now be called a Blairite wing fretted - rightly, as it turned out - that denying farmers the right to own property was not the best way to increase food production. Stalin was having none of it: the resistance of this class must be smashed in open battle, he declared. Doing so without stripping them of their property was nothing more than the prattle of Right deviators. Dekulakisation as a policy was formally abandoned in 1954, the year after Stalin died, when many deported kulaks were released. But it was not until 1991 that they and their descendants, with other victims of political repression, were formally rehabilitated.Comment: I never used to be a fan of Boris, but now I\u0026#39m desperate to see him \u0026#39Keep Buggering On\u0026#39\tGeneral Election latest news: Boris Johnson urges voters to \u0026#39come with us\u0026#39 to avoid \u0026#39horror show\u0026#39 of Brexit delayLabour anti-Semitism row: Diane Abbott accused of playing \u0026#39ide and rule\u0026#39 with British Jews Peregrine falcon-style attack drones funded by Government to prevent airport shutdownsAlun Cairns resigns as Welsh Secretary after \u0026#39brazenly lying\u0026#39 about allegations Tory candidate sabotaged rape trialLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowComment: Chris Williamson\u0026#39s departure presents Labour with a huge dilemma\tIsil blamed after 17 killed in overnight shootout at Tajikistan border outpostItaly swept up in \u0026#39Ferrante fever\u0026#39 as new novel by acclaimed author Elena Ferrante is publishedWednesday evening news briefing: Boris Johnson warns of 2020 \u0026#39horror show\u0026#39 with two referendumsDIY cervical checks boost uptake by 50 per cent among those who otherwise miss testsLiberal Democrats accused of dirty tricks as election leaflets branded \u0026#39fake news\u0026#39Jordan attack: Four tourists among eight stabbed in JerashComment: The Tories have much to gain by standing up for Britain\u0026#39s miserable commuters\tGrace Millane murder: British backpacker left dead in suitcase while killer went on date, court hearsChina launches Sudan\u0026#39s first satellite highlighting strong links between Beijing and Sudan\u0026#39s new governmentDeep space wine: Bordeaux blasts off into orbitJohn Bercow: Brexit was the biggest mistake since the war Second man admits attempting to rob Arsenal players Sead Kolasinac and Mesut Ozil We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed a level grades versus fees find leading private schools","story":"with ever rising fees, how do you work out which independent school offers the best return on your investment?Does sending your children to a private school mean they will get better A-level grades? According to a major study published this week, the answer is yes. Researchers found that privately educated children can get up to two grades higher in their A-levels than their state school peers even after their socio-economic background has been taken into account.But with ever rising fees, how do you work out which independent school offers the best return on your investment in terms of grades?Using information from the Independent Schools Council (ISC) as well as our own research and analysis, we have compiled a comprehensive database of private schools’ fees mapped against their exam results.Find your schoolOur interactive tool maps out fees per term against grades. It allows you to search for every school in England  - where their exam results are publicly available - and see how they fare against others.Hovering over a diamond on the graphic brings up the school’s name as well as its fees per term and the proportion of grades which were awarded top grades in A-levels in 2019. Independent day schools: fees vs grades - A-levelsHow it worksWe have created one graphic for day schools and another for boarding schools, as they generally charge higher fees. Schools which have both day and boarding provision will appear in both graphics, with the appropriate level of fees reflected in each one.The table covers A-level results,  as well as International Baccalaureate (IB) scores or Cambridge Pre-U grades which have been converted into their A-level equivalents. Higher level 7 and 6 at IB and Distinction 1, 2, 3 and Merit 1 at Pre-U are equivalent to A* and A at A-level.The is the second in our series of interactive graphics on private schools. Last month we published the data for private schools\u0027 GCSE results versus fees - you can view those graphics by clicking here.What’s the difference between the qualifications?The IB is a two year course where all exams are taken at the end and the final mark is out of 45. The diploma has a focus on breadth of learning and students take six subjects which must include a literature, maths, a language, a science and a humanity. Each subject is marked out of 7, which is equivalent to to top grade A* in A-levels.Students must also study a course in theory of knowledge and complete an extended essay on a topic of their choice, which between them are worth an extra three points.To be awarded the IB diploma, you are also required to take up a creative pursuit, a physical activity and participate in a form of community service. Founded in Switzerland in 1968, the diploma is favoured by private international schools.Search for the best independent schools for GCSE resultsGCSE grades versus fees - find out how leading private schools rank​The real reasons girls are outperforming boys at school​Meanwhile, the Cambridge Pre-U is available in 24 subjects, all of which are two year courses. Students can choose any combination, and can also combine some Pre-U subjects with other A-level subjects. The focus of the Pre-U is on independent learning and was designed to prepare pupils for the rigours of higher education.Devised by Cambridge University, the Pre-U was launched a decade ago. It became a popular among teachers at some of the country’s most prestigious public schools – including Eton, Westminster, Charterhouse and Winchester - who saw it as more testing than A-levels.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

which wants to maintain alignment with the EU - and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.“Negotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.“If one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.Boris Johnson is \u0027surrendering\u0027 to the chlorinated chicken“This raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Actual output has come in above the level that polls have suggested.Nonetheless, the figures demonstrate the level of confidence among British businesses and\u0026nbspshow Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal has received only a “lukewarm” reception from British firms, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Services account for four-fifths of UK output and had, until recently, remained relatively\u0026nbspresilient in while construction and manufacturing contracted sharply.Brexiteers have got it so wrong on the slumping poundAmong the worst-hit sectors has been the car industry which has seen investment collapse since the 2016 EU referendum. New data released on Tuesday showed a further 6.7 per cent slump in the number of vehicles rolling off production lines in October.Some 10,348 fewer cars were registered in October than during the same month in 2018, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The figure reflects a tough environment for businesses and consumers as economic and political uncertainty continue to hit confidence, the trade association said.The decline was driven by a 13.2 per cent drop in demand from private consumers. Sales of diesel models slumped 28.3 per cent, while petrol cars fell by 3.2 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and ScotlandOfficials at the CBI added that output remained flat in the three months to October, and is expected to fall next quarter by 9 per cent.SMEs blamed the political and economic uncertainty abroad as the biggest reason for lacking optimism, followed by import licence restrictions.Jobs in the industry shrunk by 5 per cent\u0026nbspfor the first time since January 2013 and are expected to fall at a similar pace in the next quarter, it added.As a result of the uncertainty, companies said spending on plants and machinery were down 20 per cent, with staff training spends down 25 per cent.Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at CBI, said: “As a first step to lifting the malaise, the next government must get behind business to deliver on a Brexit deal, particularly one that unlocks a smooth transition period.“Then the real heavy lifting can begin on forging a future relationship with our biggest trading partner. Ending political uncertainty will enable a renewed focus on domestic priorities, which is critical for the economy’s longer-term growth.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

which wants to maintain alignment with the EU - and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.“Negotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.“If one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.Boris Johnson is \u0027surrendering\u0027 to the chlorinated chicken“This raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Actual output has come in above the level that polls have suggested.Nonetheless, the figures demonstrate the level of confidence among British businesses and\u0026nbspshow Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal has received only a “lukewarm” reception from British firms, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Services account for four-fifths of UK output and had, until recently, remained relatively\u0026nbspresilient in while construction and manufacturing contracted sharply.Brexiteers have got it so wrong on the slumping poundAmong the worst-hit sectors has been the car industry which has seen investment collapse since the 2016 EU referendum. New data released on Tuesday showed a further 6.7 per cent slump in the number of vehicles rolling off production lines in October.Some 10,348 fewer cars were registered in October than during the same month in 2018, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The figure reflects a tough environment for businesses and consumers as economic and political uncertainty continue to hit confidence, the trade association said.The decline was driven by a 13.2 per cent drop in demand from private consumers. Sales of diesel models slumped 28.3 per cent, while petrol cars fell by 3.2 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ending political uncertainty will enable a renewed focus on domestic priorities, which is critical for the economy’s longer-term growth.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a study last year it found that around 40 per cent of adults in the United States, 36 per cent in Britain and 14 per cent in China did too little exercise to stay healthy.Created with Sketch.

It is designed to allow people to make and receive payments through Facebook-owned apps like Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, which are used by billions of people around the world.Since its unveiling, however, Libra has faced significant resistance from financial regulators in the US and Europe. In September, French economy and finance minister Bruno Le Maire\u0026nbspsaid that he would block the development of Libra and France as it posed a threat to monetary sovereignty.Bitcoin’s record price surge of 2017 was caused by a single personPoliticians in the UK have expressed similar reservations, with Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Chair Damian Collins claiming that Libra represents Facebook\u0027s attempt to turn itself into its own country.Several of the payments firms that Facebook worked with in the early stages of Libra\u0027s development, such as Mastercard and Visa, also recently dropped out.In China, plans for a state-backed cryptocurrency appear to be moving forward as the country\u0027s central bank prepares for a launch expected in the coming months.Last week, President Xi Jinping hailed bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology as an important breakthrough, marking an about-turn in the country\u0027s official stance on cryptocurrency.All negative sentiment towards the technology also appears to have been purged from Chinese social media, with cryptocurrency news resource CNLedger\u0026nbspnoting that articles saying blockchain technology is a scam are now banned.A new law coming in to effect on 1 January will also serve to facilitate the development of the cryptography business and ensuring the security of cyberspace and information.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the 2005 election, the equivalent figure was 95 per cent. Whatever the variable fortunes of the inidual players within the party political establishment, one thing was crystal clear: outsiders were unwelcome in general elections.However, five years later, non-ConservativeLabourLib Dem candidates achieved a record 10 per cent of the vote in Britain these included 920,000 votes for Ukip, 564,000 for the BNP and 491,000 for the SNP. This 2010 election result left the political establishment unshaken and only slightly stirred but the 2015 election was totally unprecedented – a full 23 per cent of all votes cast were not for the three establishment parties,\u0026nbspincluding 3.86 million for Ukip, 1.45 million for the SNP and 1.15 million for the Greens.Two years later, many thought that our politics had returned to business as usual. There was a great surge of voters back to the Conservatives and Labour in the 2017 election, who recorded\u0026nbspthe highest joint vote percentage share in any election since 1970. Along with a number of others, I expressed my scepticism about the firmness of the foundations on which this remarkable Conservative and Labour recovery was built.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt only took the 2019 European elections to reveal that 2017 was just so much Scotch mist. For an election that should not have been held and which, when it was, was only supposed to elect MEPs to serve for a few months (if at all), it was politically devastating. The Brexit Party that had only been formed less than two months before polling day took almost one-third of Britain’s votes, along with 29 of its 70 seats.The Conservatives and Labour could not muster even a quarter of the votes between them. The Tories came fifth with their lowest level of support in any national election since 1832 and Labour came third with its lowest vote share since 1910 (when it contested just 56 out of 569 British constituencies).Created with Sketch.Top 10 marginal seats to watch at the general election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75The real significance of the European parliament election was the speed with which its explosive outcome transferred into subsequent Westminster voting intention polls. As a result, the October 2019 polls sampled before the 12 December election date was settled showed the Conservatives averaging 36 per cent (down seven points on the 2017 election), Labour on 25 per cent (down 16 points), the Lib Dems on 18 per cent (up 10 points), the Brexit Party on 11 per cent (up nine points on Ukip’s 2017 share) and the Greens and other parties up two points each.None of these latest poll figures is set in concrete. But I\u0026nbspthink it would take great courage to claim that they will return during the course of this election campaign to the 84 per cent\u0026nbspshare of the total vote that the Conservatives and Labour jointly achieved in 2017.Tory MP blames ‘young person’ on campaign staff for doctored election videoThe scale of this astonishing and unprecedented electoral volatility was recently analysed by the British Election Study (BES) team. The BES has captured voting behaviour at every general election since 1964, through a series of substantial surveys of voters. The study is currently supervised by academics from Manchester University and Nuffield College, Oxford. Last month\u0026nbspthey presented some remarkable data that will feature in Electoral Shocks: The Volatile Voter in a Turbulent World (Fieldhouse et al, Oxford University Press, December 2019).\u0026nbspIn 2015, some 43 per cent\u0026nbspof voters supported a different party from in 2010 and in 2017, 33 per cent\u0026nbspchanged their vote from 2015. Overall, across all three of the last elections between 2010 and 2017, half of people (49 per cent) did not vote for the same party each time.In 2017 there was the largest switching of votes from Conservative to Labour and vice versa ever recorded by the BES. The authors\u0026nbspestimate that fully 11 per cent\u0026nbspof voters switched between the two main parties. Even in the immense Labour landslide of 1997, when a record 28 per cent\u0026nbspof all seats changed hands, the comparable figure was 9 per cent.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailUnderpinning these developments is another set of BES data that tracks the collapse in strength of party identification over past decades. In 1964, 48 per cent\u0026nbspof Conservatives described their party identification as “very strong” the figure among Labour supporters was 51 per cent. In 2017, the comparable figures were 14 per cent\u0026nbspand 23 per cent\u0026nbsprespectively.In the face of all this we still demand predictions for the outcome of the 12 December election. I suppose that is inevitable but it really would take a heart of stone not to have sympathy for those trying to find traces of order in such electoral chaos.David Cowling is a political analyst and senior visiting fellow at King’s College London.

In a study last year it found that around 40 per cent of adults in the United States, 36 per cent in Britain and 14 per cent in China did too little exercise to stay healthy.Created with Sketch.

Authorities have been raising awareness of the scheme for a number of weeks, and doubled the fine for non-compliance to 4,000 rupees (£43).Mr Kejriwal wrote on Twitter that he car-pooled to work with two cabinet colleagues. “Share cars. This will build friendship, strengthen relationships as well as save petrol and reduce pollution,” he wrote. Another minister rode to work on a bicycle, according to NDTV.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s mostly the stubble burning in the states of Punjab and Haryana which contributes to the pollution, and industrial pollution is also high.”Over\u0026nbspthe weekend, the chief minister of Punjab wrote to the prime minister Narendra Modi urging him to intervene in the crisis and criticising the “blame game” played by the various devolved governments of the region in order to avoid responsibility for action.“The harsh truth is that while all of us are busy conveniently passing the buck to one another, Delhi’s people are reeling from excruciating misery, and are facing one of the worst health disasters in the nation’s, possibly the world’s, history,” wrote Amarinder Singh.The air pollution crisis in the capital is certainly bad for India’s image internationally, with the smog literally overshadowing a T20 series opener between India and Bangladesh in Delhi on Sunday.And oft-cited WHO figures show India is home to 15 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world, despite the accolades won by Mr Modi for his perceived successes on environmental matters.With all eyes turning to the prime minister, Mr Modi’s office is yet to take a strong stand on the pollution issue, even after a Supreme Court-mandated panel declared a public health emergency in the capital last week.The prime minister’s office called an urgent review meeting on the smog on Sunday, after which it was concluded that the cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, would “monitor” the situation.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is no information around whether the nuns were abused in this case.\u0026nbspSpeaking to reporters aboard the papal plane in February as he returned to the Vatican from a visit to the United Arab Emirates, he said some of the nuns had been used as sex slaves and admitted more needed to be done to prevent it.“It is true ... there have been priests and even bishops who have done this. I think it is still going on because something does not stop just because you have become aware of it,” he said, according to the Associated Press.\u0026nbsp“We have been working on this for a long time.

It’s better to replace it with the new Great Russian Encyclopaedia in electronic form ... This will be, in any case, reliable information in a good modern form, he said, according to Russia’s RIA Novosti.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Great Russian Encyclopaedia might just be the world’s last printed encyclopaedia – initiated by decree of Vladimir Putin in 2003 and finally published in 2017.The 36-volume text, sold at just over £23 per volume, builds on the previous Soviet encyclopaedia – with critics warning many of the biographies contained within it bear a resemblance to official government talking points.Created with Sketch.20 years of Putin Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Russian President Boris Yeltsin (R) poses with the Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia, Alexei II (L) and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin (C) at the Kremlin in Moscow 31 December 1999.

On its launch writer and critic Nikolai Podosokorsky told the Christian Science Monitor: “I\u0027m not at all clear as to why we need this big encyclopaedia in the first place. I think it was one of those things decided in the early Putin era as a big prestige project.I\u0027ve gone through several articles that pertain to my area of expertise, and found them quite superficial. The lists of references at the end were often extremely biased.”But while the print edition was overtaken during its development, the Kremlin has since pledged to spend 1.7bn Rubles (£20.7bn) to move the text online.Russia’s internyet: Kremlin readies test for its ‘sovereign’ firewallLaunched in 2001, the Russian language edition of Wikipedia features more than 1.5million articles, the largest collection of any Slavic language.Over the course of its existence the website has been intermittently blocked by the Russian state – most recently in 2015 for references to marijuana.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nobody can be sure how this Battle for Britain will pan out, any more than in .Tory election manager Isaac Levido told staff this week: “There is a steep and narrow path to victory.”Another aide says: “It is unknowable. This is fraught with danger.”Polls are all over the place, some showing an easily blown Tory lead of six per cent — less than Theresa May’s before she lost her majority.Momentum Labour has made a flying start with social media, bombarding targeted voters with eye-catching and wildly misleading messages — just as it did so successfully in .“You would think the Tory machine might have learned from that debacle, but they haven’t,” says an insider. “And you can’t build a new system overnight from scratch.”The challenge for the Tories is to define the battle lines within the first two weeks.“If it is a choice between Boris and Brexit or a second referendum — or even a third referendum — we are in a good place,” says an insider.But with five parties in this fight — the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit Party and SNP — lines rapidly blur.Tory rebels such as Phil Hammond can also wreak havoc by standing as independents.Even Boris’s own ,-majority Uxbridge marginal is under threat from a bizarre invasion of Extinction Rebellion and Stop HS protesters.Nigel Farage, stung by Boris’s successful EU deal, has stunningly over-reached, threatening to field  Brexit Party candidates — although he won’t risk standing himself.His wrecking ball move has backfired among old allies including Leave campaign partner Arron Banks and one-time Ukip MP Douglas Carswell.His own party chiefs are in revolt, with Farage under pressure to back down fast.Cash donors have begun deserting and pro-Brexiteers are voting with their feet.One Sun reader, Brian Pearsall — a “paid-up Brexit Party supporter” — tells me: “I will be backing Boris. Mr Farage is beginning to annoy me. If he wants us to get out he should put candidates only in seats where the Tories have no chance of winning. What the hell’s got into him ”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has also misjudged the national mood by junking Brexit altogether — and campaigning to rejoin the EU.Her party has slipped in the polls and she is offering pacts to a ragbag of Greens, Plaid Cymru and any other minority group who might offer a hand.Yet every vote picked up by Swinson and Farage in Tory target marginals opens the door to a Labour advance.The stakes in this General Election have never been higher — or clearer. More than million adults voted in  to leave the European Union.Unless they have changed their minds, this is their last chance of seeing that wish come true.No more ritual humiliation of humble MPs who incur his wrath or ministers who dare challenge his petty tyranny.Parliament will take a while to recover its ­dignity after a torrid ten-year political trauma. But the blighter Bercow has gone at last.Long live the new Speaker, whoever he or she may be. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Evenwe can argue about the “weather” bit.Two contestants, though, go straight into the all-time Apprentice Hall Of Fame, alongside the greats like Paul Torrisi and Stuart Baggs.First is Cockney barrow boy Thomas Skinner, who sticks out among the boys like Ray Winstone in a touring production of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert, and has turned out to be a lot more likeable than I was expecting.The second, though, most certainly hasn’t. For she is Lottie Lion, the librarian and wine snob who’s given to quoting Shakespeare: “For though she is but little she is a massive pain in the a**e.” Or words to that effect.All your worst office nightmares rolled into one, this girl. An undermining, ­passive-aggressive crawler who can swivel on a sixpence, depending on which way Lord Sugar’s wind is blowing.“In business there is no room for ­gambling.” “Hang on. Business is a gamble. You don’t take risks, you get nowhere.” “Yes, risk-taking is important, Lord Sugar.”Lottie’s also not helped by the fact she’s often right and most certainly wasn’t to blame for the failure of the scavenger hunt task which disintegrated, in ­shameful fashion, right at the start when team Empower’s Pamela Laird asked: “Does anyone know when the Second World War started ” Silence. They didn’t know when it started, ­finished, or even what side was responsible for killing Biggie and Tupac.A media meltdown followed, yet, amid the general despair, no one bothered to thank The Apprentice for the public ­service of flagging up this ignorance, because that’s not what happens with this show. Instead, it gets accused of stuff.This year, inevitably, it’s been called racist and claims have been made that the first four candidates were sacked due to their skin colour, rather than the fact they were completely useless or ­produced a “bespoke ­corporate ­lollipop” that looked more like a vibrator.It’s only Twitter that’s saying these things, of course, but they need to be quashed as the BBC is actually dumb enough to listen to these imbeciles and forget Sugar’s first winner was Tim Campbell and his show is about the only place on the network where black and minority ethnic people will be treated entirely on their merits.Get rid of The Apprentice and, I guarantee you, its ­precious and entertaining hours will be filled with the same mollycoddling, box-ticking, ­condescending, right-on ­b*****ks that fills most of the rest of the Beeb’s output.Treasure this show while you still can .The One Show, Matt Baker: “I’m very much looking forward to talking about your play, Meera [Syal].”The X Factor: Celebrity, Louis Walsh to Jenny Ryan: “Very few people can sing Shirley Bassey but you nailed every single note.”With a Black  Decker staple gun and no anaesthetic.ONLY two places there’s ever likely to be a demand for Vinnie Jones to sing Lip Up Fatty, by Bad Manners.One of them is Piers Morgan’s Hollywood wake.Thankfully, that’s probably still a good  or  months away.So I’ll stick with the other, X Factor: Celebrity, where we were already several horrors into the night when Martin Bashir’s brain developed technical issues, just as he was about to assault the second verse of EasyLike Sunday Morning.“I’ve forgotten the words . . .“A wah wah-waaah wanna be freeeee.“I do apologise.”Not necessary, Martin.Vinnie’s manic can-can took the initial sting out of things a couple of turns later.And, when it came to the climax, Simon Cowell dodged his decision and the public voted-off Jonny Labey and Victoria Ekanoye instead of a startled Bashir, who gasped: “What has happened ”You stayed silent. They sang. Go figure.Seven Worlds, One Planet cutting and pasting that horrendous old footage of the sky-ing walruses.A BBC continuity woman deciding His Dark Materials is our “new Sunday night obsession”. .The slyly partisan One Show featuring a film with Corbynista Ken Loach calling for “real change”, on the day the election was called.And arch-luvvie David Tennant describing the responsibility of murdering one Proclaimers song for Children In Need: Got It Covered as: “A bit like National Service.”For you or the viewers, David THE guessing games begin as soon as the opening credits for BBC’s big new Sunday night drama kick in and reveal it’s set in a parallel universe.A place where relationships between humans and their animal soul-mates are unusually close.Swindon “Oxford.”Oooh, close, but no cigar at the start of His Dark Materials, an epic, eight-part adaptation of author Philip Pullman’s trilogy that’ll probably go down well with anyone who’s read the books and loves fantasy adventure.Unfortunately, I haven’t read the books and hate fantasy adventure.My loss, I realise. It means I draw an emotional blank with the show’s incredible production valuesand even Ruth Wilson’s fabulous performance as Mrs Coulter.Initial stumbling block is the fact everyone’s trailed around by their own soul in animal form, Daemons who can all talk but never once stop to take a dump or cock their leg against the scenery.Teenage heroine Lyra has a shape-shting weasel thing called Pantalaimon, James “Asriel” McAvoy’s got Stelmaria the snow leopard and John Torode’s got a hairless gastropod called Gregg. But that’s another show, I think.On this one, there’s also the all-powerful Magisterium, giving everyone the creeps, and the uncharted north’s mysterious city in the sky, which James McAvoy is getting quite excited about.The detail that finished off His Dark Materials for me, though, was the news that arrived just before the climax of episode one.“Roger’s been taken by the Gobblers.”As the late, great Eric Morecambe once said, there really is no answer to that.Would it be fair to assume the BBC’s bisexual Dracula bats for both sides BBC’s darkly funny Guilt, with Mark Bonnar and Jamie Sives.The nightmarish, bird-eating Iranian viper footage on Seven Worlds One Planet.Lee Mack pretending to be Anneka Rice’s nude le model on the outstanding Would I Lie To You .C’s brilliant Celebrity Hunted climaxing with the question: “Is Gavin Henson really stupid enough to go back to his own house ” .And best ever breakfast TV host, Piers Morgan, marking his eagerly awaitedto Good Morning Britain by identying singer Ruby Turner as the rhyming slang for curry, “Ruby Murray”.Food food food, Piers.Clinton Morrison: “I think Mesut Ozil had a prove to point.”Jeff Stelling: “For United this is a matter of extreme danger with a capital X.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Piglet and Eeyore are companions of which fictional bear ”Matt: “Donkey.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Pemberton Place in Atlanta is named after the inventor of what soft drink ”Glynis: “Orange.”Bradley Walsh: “Which cabinet designer ­published a book of his own designs in  ”Vivien: “Mr Ikea.”And Bradley Walsh: “Dingoes are said to have been introduced to Australia by whom ”Kirsten: “The Kennel Club.”SO what’s it like in the non-stop Mardi Gras of ­EastEnders at the moment Callum: “I’ve been thinking of taking an ­embalming course.”CHILDREN In Need: Got It Covered.My ears: Got ’em covered.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Just ask anyone old enough to remember British Rail.While dinosaurs Corbyn and McDonnell play fantasy politics, aspirational young working class voters have more realistic priorities. Such as wanting reductions in income tax and stamp duty.There is so much more at stake in this general election than just the threat Labour poses to Brexit.DOES anyone know what Labour’s position on Brexit is Jeremy Corbyn claims to have told his squabbling shadow cabinet to fall in behind him and toe the party line.Whether Corbyn will let the voters know what that agreed position is before the election is another matter.Given Labour fought the last election promising to respect the referendum result and has done everything possible since to thwart it, we doubt it.It is suggested Labour would try to renegotiate with the EU for a closer trading partnership , then hold another referendum.What they would do about the inevitable deadlock is anyone’s guess. Meanwhile, several Labour front-benchers have suggested they would campaign for Remain.One union leader has branded them “ludicrous”. The fudges and fence-sitting may have worked for Corbyn in  but surely it won’t fool voters again.

But in the meantime, it’s important to take whatever diabetes medication helps you to manage your blood sugar levels properly to prevent long term complications.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Presenter Susanna Reid asked the Shadow Cabinet minister five times how Labour would campaign in a second referendum.Unable to give a straight answer, he blustered: “Well, in a sense, what I campaign for is secondary because what we are saying is that it is for the country to decide.  We’re saying less power to politicians, that’s where we have been struck for the last ½ years.”Ms Reid asked him againLabour wanted Britain to leave the EU or remain. An almost incoherent Sir Keir muttered: “The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you.”He also revealed that while he will be in charge of Labour’s bid to renegotiate Brexit, he has already ruled out voting for the deal in a second referendum. Instead he wants Britain to Remain. But challenged on this bizarre stance, the rattled frontbencher said: “That is missing the point.”Sir Keir went on to say the EU’s Customs Union would have to be “reconfigured” because it only allows Member States to set the negotiating mandates for free trade agreements .Labour wants to rip up the rules so the UK can negotiate FTAs “in conjunction” with the bloc. But EU diplomats warned there was “not much” the bloc could do to involve Britain in shaping its trade policy other than drawing up a “consultation” role.And in a major blow to Mr Corbyn’s election hopes, outgoing Brussels boss Jean-Claude Juncker last night panned Labour’s vision. Speaking about Mr Corbyn’s plan to negotiate a new deal with the EU and then put it to a second referendum, Mr Juncker told the BBC: “Honestly spoken, I don’t think that this is a realistic approach.”But the Labour boss defended the policy, insisting his party can negotiate a brand new agreement with the EU in less than three months.He said: “Keir and I have spent many, many hours in Brussels and other European capitals. We wouldn’t be saying thiswe didn’t think it was realistic and do-able.”But Mr Juncker wasn’t the only senior EU official to dismiss the idea. One senior source said Mr Corbyn’s strategy was “not credible” and “delusional”.Another admitted that rewriting the PM’s deal to include a closer relationship would be “easy” to achieve within three months, but added: “Less straightforward is what the UK may ask on EU trade policy.”KEIR STARMER: You get a referendum...you get the choice between the best deal that can be secured...or Remain.SR: And what are you going to campaign for in that second referendum KS: What I campaign for is secondary...SR: Hang on, hang on, I need to know what you believe in  Do you think we should leave or remain KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you.SR: But I am voting for you...Do you want to leave or remain KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you. I’ve said many times what my personal position is.SR: You want to remain.KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you. But that is missing the point.SR: So I am voting to stay in the EU...Are we leaving or remaining KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you. We are going to, within six months, have a referendum and we are going to say here is the best deal that can be secured and it is going to go up against Remain and we are going to let the public decide.SR: It will be such a good deal that you yourself will vote against it KS: Well we are duty bound to get the best deal…SR: But how can it be a really good dealyou are going to vote against it After Sir Keir’s sloppy interview, he and Mr Corbyn travelled to the swing seat of Harlow, Essex, to insist Labour’s contorted Brexit position was in fact “very simple”.But Mr Corbyn refused to rule out reversing the EU referendum result altogetherthat helps him get the keys to No.He said: “All I can say is we are campaigning to win this election with a majority Labour government. We are not campaigning to form a coalition with anybody. We’re campaigning to go into office to carry out our manesto and that’s exactly what we’re going to be doing for the next five weeks in this election campaign.”Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson has already “ruled out” a deal to put Mr Corbyn in Downing Street. But former Labour MP Chuka Umunna — now a Lib Dem — hinted a back-room arrangement may be possibleLabour ditches its leader.He added: “The two main parties in their current configuration are not fit for purpose.”“The Labour Party can’t deliver that change and are a vote for the opposite — more delay and uncertainty. They won’t rule out revoking Article  altogether and want unlimited immigration, which would put pressure on our NHS.”In another stump speech, Mr Corbyn will insist the December  election is not about him, as he sets out his stall to be PM. He will tell an audience in Telford, Shrops, he aims to be “the kind of Prime Minister who only seeks power in order to share power — because it isn’t about me, it’s about all of us”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet the way Ahmed’s case has been pumped up as a great cause celebre for women is frankly ridiculous.The real scandal is not that a highly paid female BBC presenter has been paid less than a male one. It is that the BBC is lavishing such fat pay on any of them while pleading poverty and ending free TV licences for people over .Ahmed’s case for equal pay is very weak. It is based on the argument that presenting Newswatch — which holds BBC’s news programmes to account — is of equal value to presenting Vine’s old show, Points Of View, which invited comments from the public on a wide iety of BBC programmes.The BBC claims the disparity is down to the fact that Points Of View is classied as entertainment while Newswatch comes under news.  Surely a more direct comparison would be between what Ahmed is paid and what her male predecessor, Raymond Snoddy, was paid.She received the same as he did. How is that gender discrimination   But while the BBC might have a strong defence in Ahmed’s case, it doesn’t endear the corporation to me.Every time the BBC Charter comes up for renewal, it poses as a terribly worthy public ­service broadcaster putting out serious, educational programmes no commercial broadcaster would touch.Unless the Government allows it to jack up the licence fee, it argues, it will mean no more David Attenborough, no more news correspondents in Mogadishu.Then, as soon as the BBC Charter is renewed, it goes back to pumping out the same old entertainment shows, many of them indistinguishable from commercial TV.A genuine public service broadcaster would not pay Gary Lineker £.million a year, Graham Norton £,or Huw Edwards £,.Compared with the fattest of BBC fat cats, Samira Ahmed might well feel undervalued. Yet earning £ for presenting a -minute programme would be a dream for many TV licence-payers, many of whom do not even earn that amount of money in a week.The BBC is merciless in its efforts to collect what is really a tax on TV ownership. Unlike other unpaid utility bills, failing to buy a TV licence is a criminal offence, leading to low-paid people struggling with finances being dragged through the courts.Last year, , people were prosecuted for non-payment. By the way,  per cent of them were women — possibly because they were more likely to be at home during the day when TV licence enforcement officers tend to call. That is the real gender unfairness, not highly paid female BBC presenters receiving less money than male presenters.Ahmed’s case has highlighted the old boys’ world from which the BBC hires its presenters.  Vine, she claims, was “gted” his Radio  show without any proper recruitment process. BBC management then allowed his agent to jack up his salary.The BBC seems to see itself as immune from the pay restraint where in the public sector. When David Cameron became Prime Minister, he said any public body would need an extremely good excuse to pay anyone more than the £, a year he then earned.Yet the BBC’s accounts for   show it paid  “on-air talent” salaries in excess of this figure.  While there have been token reductions for some male ­presenters, such as the now- retired John Humphrys, many have seen salary increases.High pay doesn’t end with the presenters. There were also  BBC managers and executives who were paid more than the PM last year.  If the BBC wants to justy the TV licence, it needs to be cutting excessive pay among its board and ­presenters.If it wants to be a commercial station, on the other hand, it should give up the licence fee and find funding from subscriptions and ­advertising.  Then it wouldn’t be our business how much its executives and presenters were paid because their salaries would come out of the pockets only of people who chose to subscribe to its programmes.This is particularly important now, in the week that both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have vowed to sort out the threat of over-s losing their licence fee exemption.As it becomes an urgent election issue, the worst look for the BBC is to be seen throwing money at presenters rather than the people it needs most — its loyal viewers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But, theres not much that can be done to treat it.Due to the fact it is a virus, antibiotics - which attack bacteria - are powerless in the face of this vomiting bug.Norovirus is spread through close contact with someone who has the illness, touching surfaces that are contaminated with the bug and eating contaminated food.You are most infectious within the first  hours of your symptoms starting.But, there are ways people can reduce the risk of catching it and passing it on to others.Its highly contagious and so its important to practise good hygiene by thoroughly washing hands with soap and warm water, Mr Phin said.Stay away from places like hospitals and care homes, and avoid preparing food or having close contact with others when youre ill, to limit the spread of norovirus.If a member of your family falls ill with the bug, its vital to thoroughly disinfect all surfaces they come into contact with, to limit the spread of the virus.We advise you should avoid visiting GP surgeries, care homes and hospitalsyou have symptoms, he added.If anyone has symptoms and is concerned they should contact NHS  or talk to their GP on the phone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Charities demanded an investigation after a string of taxpayer-funded myth-busting promotions breached the advertising code  times. In a scathing ruling, the Advertising Standards Authority said a boast that UC “works” because claimants move into work faster was unsubstantiated, exaggerating and misleading. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Mirror: “The Conservatives have been caught red-handed trying to cover up the cruelty of Universal Credit. “Universal Credit has pushed families into poverty, debt and forced many to rely on food banks. We don’t need spin, we need it scrapped.”    It is a humiliation for Tories at Department for Work and Pensions , whose adverts ironically claimed a lot was written about UC - not all of it correct. Chiefs had boasted the nine-week feature in thenewspaper would show our more confident, front-footed strategy to tackle misconceptions about the benefit. But the ASA banned five adverts from being used again in their previous form after upholding three complaints and part of a fourth. Raji Hunjan, chief executive of the welfare charity ZK which complained to the ASA, demanded an independent probe into the DWPaposs working practices. If it has misled the public on Universal Credit – its flagship policy - what  is it misleading us on  she said. This is a huge win for the tens of thousands of ordinary people who are suffering as a result of a broken benefits system.    “This damning judgement reveals an attitude which is not acceptable in public service, especially in the Department charged with protecting people from living in poverty. Jonathan Blades of the MS Society said: “This ruling exposes the DWP’s indefensible attempt to provide inaccurate information to vulnerable people.The fact is that Universal Credit is leaving disabled people signicantly worse off, and in some cases forcing them to turn to food banks.It’s equally disgraceful these adverts have cost the taxpayer more than £,, at a time when disabled people are typically losing £, a year thanks to welfare system changes. Emma Revie, chief executive at the Trussell Trust food bank charity, added: “This ruling is confirmation that the DWP cannot easily gloss over the realities of Universal Credit, particularly the five week wait for a first payment.  Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood added: They can’t hide the truth thatpeople are being forced in ever increasing numbers to turn to food banks to survive, the social security system is not protecting people from poverty as it should. “The reality is that advances are loans that need to be paid back, often on top of other debts and rent arrears built up during the five week wait, leaving many people at risk of destitution. “Labour will scrap Universal Credit, end the five week wait and abolish the benefit cap and the two-child limit. This is real change that will make a dference to people’s lives, not misleading PR.” The series of adverts outlined “myths” about Universal Credit alongside information from DWP. Some adverts included the phrase: “MYTH Universal Credit doesn’t work FACT It does. People move into work faster on Universal Credit than they did on the old system.” But the ASA said this claim was based on three-year-old data that only included single unemployed claimants without children or housing costs. That meant three adverts which contained the claim breached rules on misleading advertising, exaggeration, and substantiating and qualying claims. Similar breaches were found in three adverts that claimed MYTH You have to wait  weeks to get any money on UC FACT If you need money, your Jobcentre will urgently pay you an advance.

Askedher party was being overly optimistic about the number of potential seats it could win, Ms Swinson was defiant. “Politics is very volatile at the moment, and it’s volatile because we’ve got a new fault line that runs right through both the Conservative and Labour parties as they currently are,” she said. “There are some people who hope, hope, hope it’s going to go back to business as usual, and that they’ll wake up from what they consider a nightmare and it’ll be the same politics.

The former MP finally lashed out and revealed the full force of his opinions after years of claims he was biased against Britain leaving the EU. Mr Bercow had previously said he voted Remain but insisted he was an impartial Speaker, and avoided giving clear-cut public opinions on the matter. Yet in his first comments since quitting as an MP on Monday, he told the Foreign Press Association - quoted by La Repubblica - Iaposm no longer the Speaker so I donapost have to remain impartial now. Butyou ask me honestly, aposdo I think that Brexit is good for our global standing apos, my honest answer is aposno, I don’tapos. I think that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the post-war period. That is my honest view.  He added: I completely respect the Prime Minister [...] I completely respect the rights of the Prime Minister, leading the largest party in Parliament to try to get support for his position, which is to get Brexit done.If he had the numbers, he could have got the first base done. He made a start by getting agreement towards the end, but not to the legislation. And he decided to leave that and instead to seek the public mandate. I respect his right to his view, which is a view very widely shared.But there is an alternative view equally that heaposs very widely shared. And my own personal opinion is that Brexit does not help us. We are part of a world of power blocs and trade blocs, my feeling is that it is better to be part of that power block and of that trade bloc than not. Mr Bercow stood down to be replaced by his deputy Sir Lindsay Hoyle after more than a decade in the heavy green chair. He developed a reputation for standing up for MPsapos rights against the government - granting more emergency debates and urgent questions in the Commons. But he faced fierce criticism from Brexiteers, who questioned his impartiality on the issue of Europe when he repeatedly granted debates and powers to Remainer MPs. Brexiteers say he tore up precedent and convention to allow pro-EU MPs to rule against the government and pass laws to prevent a no-deal Brexit.

The Toriesapos chairman has been monstered on ITVaposs Good Morning Britain for releasing a doctored video - of someone, er, being aposmonsteredapos on ITVaposs Good Morning Britain.James Cleverly was savaged by host Piers Morgan for cynically editing footage of Labour on the previous dayaposs edition of the breakfast TV show.In a car crash interview, Mr Cleverly spent more than  minutes trying to pretend a fake news lie of Keir Starmer talking about Brexit was not doctored, when it clearly was to anyone who has eyes.In the end he tried to shut down host Piers Morgan and leave for a dferent interview - as he said exasperated: For goodness sake Piers, let me finish!    Well, the person the Tories didnapost let finish was Mr Starmer. Yesterdayaposs original GMB interview saw Piers Morgan ask the Shadow Brexit Secretary why he thought the EU would give Labour a good deal,there was a risk theyaposd campaign against it in a second referendum. The doctored video, viewed well over a million times, inserted several seconds of video showing Sir Keiraposs face in silence - apparently after the question. But in reality, Sir Keir immediately replied: Well, Piers, I have been talking to the EU, to political leaders across the EU  countries for the last three years, and I know very well what the parameters are of any deal they would do with a Labour government. We actually explored some of it in the cross-party talks that we were in with the government six months or so ago.  So I know that a customs union and single market alignment, and protection of workersapos rights and environmental rights and consumer rights is something that can be negotiated. Mr Cleverly was also slammed over the video by the BBC today, where Radio  host Nick Robinson told him: You put something out deliberately to mislead. But by far the most scathing criticism was from Piers Morgan - who said James Cleverlyaposs shameless refusal to accept the video was doctored was staggering. You seem completely unconcerned, he raged at the Tory HQ chief. The Conservative Party website, the official one, posted a fake video, that had a fake moment that never happened, on TV. If youaposre prepared to do that on day one of a campaign, why should we believe any video or anything that you guys put up    James Cleverly insisted: The official Conservative Campaign HQ Twitter account put out your video.What we did is because we wanted to make sure the video was short and punchy we had to take out an awful lot of the waffle. Mr Cleverly neglected to mention that CCHQ only shared the full interview after criticism about its doctored version. He did answer the question. You may not like the answer! Piers Morgan told him. You changed the video... Itaposs misleading and itaposs a lie! Even a Tory candidate apologised last night after sharing the video.    Johnny Mercer said: It would appear this has inexplicably been doctored at the end. I apologise and will remove it. The original interview was bad enough. Piers Morgan said: Johnny Mercer, who retweeted the fake one, has now put a grovelling apology out on his Twitter account for putting out basically a lie. And Iaposm staggered frankly that youaposre not prepared to sit here - youaposve always struck me as an honourable, straight talker - how can you defend this  Itaposs fake news! Mr Morgan added he was talking a load of flannel and defending fake news. Yet Mr Cleverly continued to defend the fake video in a cringeworthy exchange.

Chester Crown Court heard Dan Zaharia, , from Runcorn, began tormenting Jewish psychologist Dr Eli Somer and his family after briefly being his patient in Israel in . After discharging himself from treatment, Zaharia developed delusions that Dr Somer had mind-raped him and began sending emails, making phone calls and leaving voicemails making threats of murder against Dr Somer. He also threatened Dr Someraposs relatives and threats of sexual violence against his victim’s family. James Coutts, prosecuting, revealed how sick Zaharia’s stalking extended to targeting Dr Somer’s elderly parents, who had survived the Holocaust, with anti-Semitic abuse down the phone.    Zaharia’s obsessive abuse included singing Nazi songs to Dr Somer, threatening to strangle him, kill his family, and harm his granddaughter. He sent sinister messages to one of Dr Somer’s adult sons in which he vowed to turn his shoes red from the blood of your children and claimed he would slaughter your children to the last one while accusing the -year-old son of penetrating his computer. In one disturbing call, Zaharia told Dr Somer’s we that he would fry hisbrains and cook his children. He also threatened to kill his donkey, and at times sounded as though he was performing a sex act while on the phone, the court was told. The qualied dentist sent Dr Somer photographs of his car parked in its space outside his home indicating he had been there, and in April  was refused entry from a conference in Amsterdam, where Dr Somer and his we were smuggled out via a back entry for their safety. Zaharia was arrested the following year when he turned up at a conference in Switzerland where the doctor was a guest speaker.Further disturbing contact included posting on his victim’s daughter’s Facebook work page and a voicemail on Dr Somer’s we’s phone claiming he would dance on your children’s graves having murdered them.Zaharia’s vile racism was not confined to Jewish people – whom he repeatedly referred to under a iety of disgusting slurs – and during one of his rants he made a sick threat relating to his victim’s n* granddaughter. Cheshire police were contacted on November , , and Zaharia was arrested on November . In interview he made partial admissions but claimed Dr Somer had wronged him.    The defendant was bailed on condition of non-contact but his victim continued to receive phone calls from withheld numbers. The defendant had no previous UK convictions, cautions or reprimands, but had been sent down for two months while in the Israeli Army for threatening to kill and rape a dental assistant. A victim personal statement read to the court recounted how Dr Somer had suffered anxiety, stress, sleeplessness and nightmares due to his ordeal. He no longer promotes conference appearances and feels embarrassed among colleagues over having to deal with Zaharia and the need for extra security. He now believes the defendant is intent on destroying him, the court was told. Andrew Jebb, representing Zaharia, cited a psychiatrist’s medical report that said Zaharia was suffering from undiagnosed psychosis which is probably a persistent delusional disorder and a particular set of delusional beliefs about Dr Somer, which he developed after perceiving that the psychologist had suggested that Zaharia might have been sexually abused as a child. A probation report deemed the defendant as low risk of re-conviction but medium risk of harm. Mr Jebb asked for mitigation for Zaharia’s guilty plea and said Zaharia – who has dual Canadian-Romanian citizenship – wanted to move to Hungary to practise as a dentisthe received a suspended sentence. Judge Michael Leeming, presiding, sentenced Zaharia to  months in prison immediate custody - the maximum term available after credit for his guilty plea, and imposed an indefinite restraining order to protect Dr Somer and his relatives.

There have been no trips to the buildersapos merchants to get modern plaster and pre-cut wood - Anton has used all traditional materials such as lime mortar, and the solid oak beams have been cut and constructed on site. The huge front door hinges and studs have been forged onsite using traditional blacksmith methods and all the roof and ceiling beams are fitted together with chunky, handmade wooden pegs - all just as it would have been when the house was constructed and then extended more than  years ago.  Itaposs no surprise to discover that Anton describes his occupation as a aposconservation builderapos and that for him there was no option with this property that he loves but to provide the structure with the attention to historical detail it deserves. But go back five years and maybe Anton might not have saved The Old Castleheaposd known what a struggle it would be. At the time he purchased the ruin for £, and turned up for the first day of work at the most challenging renovation project he could ever imagine, except now it was a reality. He says: It was completely ruined, in fact it shouldnapost really have been saved because it was too far gone! At least five metres off the top of the walls had to be taken down simply because it has been open to the elements for over  years. Yes, it hasnapost had a roof for over  years.  Anton says the restoration was excruciating to do, both physically and mentally. The first day was horrendous, trying to tackle the undergrowth and trees that had sprung up within and around the ruin. A huge maze of scaffolding needed to be erected, including over the top of the ruin, to at long last get the site watertight and ready for the biggest renovation Anton has ever tackled. He remembers: All the stone dressings were found buried in the floor in pieces, so we dug those up and put them all back together like a massive jigsaw piece. Hundreds of tons of stone needed to be lted in the air and we did it all with block and tackle which is the original lting mechanism just the two of us, we did it all by hand. The legend of the huge hole in the wall dates back to a time when the site was pillaged and stripped of all its internal features by thieves using a horse and cart to carry the spoils away. Anton says: We found lots of the stone from the hole buried and put them all back in one of the walls.  It was smashed out probably hundreds of years ago so people could come in and steal substantial things like all the sandstone windows and fireplaces. Anton says every aspect of the restoration was done by hand, with the roof causing the most dficulty. He says: The beams weigh about one to two tonnes each and we had to lt them six-foot up into the air. It would have been easier to build it from new. But there was no chance of that ever happening, not just because the property is listed but also because of the special atmosphere the unique house and its remaining ruins exude. Anton says: Itaposs a lovely atmosphere here, most people can feel it, itaposs a special thing. Itaposs church like and very peaceful however itaposs got a very welcoming atmosphere.  And what is special and unique about it is that thereaposs still this ruinous part attached to the home. I think to restore the remaining ruin would actually ruin it! Itaposs what makes the house so romantic. From every window there is a view that will force a new owner to linger and admire, whether itaposs views of the remaining ruins, the sea views or the rural vistas of the two acres of land that come with the property. The garden is a totally private, walled space that has many potential surprises to delight a new owner. Anton says he has found many historic coins on the land, plus a massive key he assumes once opened the front door of this home. He says: We found an actual Henry VIII crown that was connected with the early building because it was embedded in the floor, which was a brilliant find.

Within five months, sheaposs gone from an unhappy  stone  pounds to a  stone  pounds yummy mummy. And she says her new look has given her a new energy and zest for le. Doris had made Tracy promise to spend the money on herself after she spent years bringing her three children up alone. Tracy, a -year-old hairdresser from Peterborough, Cambs, said: I have always been a chunky girl, I have been trying all my le to lose weight, I couldnapost get my head around it, I think Iaposve tried every diet on the planet.    Since being a parent it has been the hardest. As a single mum of three kids, trying to juggle everything, my only treats were bars of chocolate. I was really close to my nan, she was always telling me aposIaposd love to see you happy, Iaposd like you to lose some weight and meet somebody and be happy. She was taken really poorly and she told me aposIaposve left you some money and I want you to spend them on you, not on the kids, not paying bills, not doing anything , just spend it on you- and thataposs exactly what Iaposve done. I couldnapost have done it without my nanaposs money, I wouldnapost have gotten a loan to have it done because I would have felt I was being really selfish but when my nan told this is what she wanted me to do with it, that was it for me. Of course, I still felt I had to put half of the money away from my childrenaposs futures - but I hope my nan would be happyshe could see how itaposs changed all of our lives. Tracy had been dreaming of transforming her look for years, and managed to save enough money to have a gastric sleeve operation herself before her nan died.    But since Doris died, she was more determined than ever to lose all her excess weight - stone - and has since had .lb of loose skin removed. She plans to have even more surgery in December, when she will have .lb removed. In August she had a apos lower body ltapos, which is a removal of the hanging skin, from the front and the back and a breast reduction that cost £,. She is also planning to have another procedure in December, to get rid of the skin in the inner thighs and upper arms which is going to cost another £,. She added: Although the pain was awful, I did wake up the next morning, looked at myself in the mirror and thought aposOh my God, I love that belly!apos- it was the most exciting thing. My tummy skin literally hung on my thighs- I used to tell my kids, when I was going up the stairs my tummy was giving me a round of applause, no more rounds of applause anymore!    I am very very happy, I have had a massive confidence boost, I feel better with myself and now I even have a man in my le. It literally has transformed me- itaposs not just about the weight loss. The weight loss has given me the strength to do things I would never have done before. I have been going to the gym, which I never thought it could happen- I was thinking Iaposm never going to be able to do a class or keep up with anybody and now itaposs awesome because I am doing exactly the same things as the skinny girls in front of me.

By accusing the tower block’s residents of lacking common sense, the Cabinet minister betrays his contempt for the public. Another such moment is an outraged rape victim demanding the resignation of Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns. A leaked email has contradicted the senior Tory’s claim he didn’t know about a Conservative candidate – his former aide – causing the trial of her alleged rapist to collapse. The backlash against Tories who care little for little people leaves Boris Johnson, a PM out of touch himself, looking more cynical than ever with his endless  Brexit promises. Rees-Mogg’s callousness wasn’t just about Grenfell.  It exposed an arrogant Conservative Party mindset, sneering at ordinary folk and blaming them for the effects of the Tories’ own ideology of deregulation and austerity. Labour’s demand for real change looks more compelling than ever. Birth rights DNA tests at birth to detect which diseases children are likely to develop is a major advance by an NHS taking the initiative.

Her nurse noticed that I was sweating and looking unwell and told me to go to the emergency room downstairs, but I didnapost listen until I tried to stand up and fell straight back down. When I went downstairs I gave urine samples, had all sorts of scans and was hooked up to IV drips - and after a while I was told I had a UTI, which gave me instant relief.

This time I said goodbye to my family because I was certain that I couldnapost be lucky a third time, but somehow I was.

You can’t say: ‘Don’t worry about it boys, we can just turn up and we’ll get the right calls this time’.“You need to put your stamp on the match and hurt whoever you are playing. They will be thinking the same. The talk will not be about that game. It will be about this match and what it means to us as a club.”The Dens gaffer is in no doubt his side are a “stronger group” this time around.And he points to the quality that’s been added since in the shape of former West Brom, Norwich and Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans.“I would say we are a stronger group,” James said.“We have added quality to the group. However, United will be stronger, too, because, although they didn’t make wholesale changes, they have been able to work with their players and they have been on a good run.“I think the benefits we have had on the training ground they will have had as well.“They may not have needed as much work but we felt we did need to put in the work on the training field in terms of how we go about things.“I think you can see that and, hopefully, you will see it on Friday night again.”He added: “I still don’t think we are completely there.“I don’t knowI will ever think that. In terms of training and that, then yes.“The international break came at a good time for us because we hadn’t yet had the chance to integrate Graham Dorrans into the squad.“We also had Jamie Ness coming back so it was a really good time to get a week’s training done.“Then we have had the games coming in thick and fast and you can see the benefit of that week.“The boys have been getting to know each other and what’s good and their strengths.“It is tough to just tell them that, you need to work on it day in, day out on the training field. I think even the top teams will tell you that.“Getting a settled squad after the window shut and being able to work with the boys – that has certainly helped us.”Meanwhile, the Dens boss is hopeful left-back Jordan Marshall will be fit to start on Friday after he limped off early in the - win over Morton last week.James said: “He is OK, I think. We left him out of training yesterday but he is gradually getting better. Hopefully, we caught it at the right time.“He did look a bit tired the other night, as did some others. We are asking Jordan and the others to press hard in the game but, hopefully, he will be all right.“The fans have taken to him and I can see why. He is very consistent and has a good end product as well which goes under-rated at times.“We will get him through this week and he will be fine.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da6f30ce49858.60239106-472x564.jpg ","title":"dundee derby huge game but dee gaffer mcpake says league doesnt rest on result","story":"Dundee manager James McPake is backing his players to live up to the “great occasion” of Friday’s Dundee derby.However, he has stressed nothing will be decided in terms of how the Championship will finish up at Dens Park this week.The Dark Blues welcome rivals Dundee United to their home turf on Friday aiming to put right the humiliation suffered at Tannadice back in August as they were beaten - .Defeat would see Dundee fall nine points behind United in the race to get out of the Championship.Whichever way Friday goes, however, James says there is a long, long way to go in the league campaign.He said: “The derbies are a great occasion for the city. I have talked about it before, about the atmosphere and how impressive it is.“The fans are great and this week will be the same. It’s under the lights, it’s a Friday night and both teams are in decent runs of form.“It’s an important game, of course it is, because every derby is important, but nothing will be decided on Friday.“Every season someone gets tipped to run away with this league but it doesn’t happen very often. People said it after the game at Tannadice and I can understand why because of the score.“But this is a tough league and it will be nip and tuck all the way through. Nothing in this league will be decided until May.”The Dens gaffer admits that defeat at Tannadice took some time to get over but things have changed for Dundee since.He added: “The - game at Tannadice was my first defeat, so it was a tough one to take.“You have to dig deep into yourself – and you don’t get much sleep. You go over everything, it was a Friday night and that makes it an even longer weekend.“Every bad result you have as a manager hurts you more because there are so many factors to it.“Your biggest rivals got a big result over you but you need to look at yourselves and get it right. I believe we are getting it right.“We have fans and players who have real pride but we also have players who didn’t play in that game so maybe it won’t have a great impact on Friday.”McPake previously said in a pre-season interview that the derby matches were huge for the fans, who #want the bragging rights# which come with winning the ties."},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/5dc2a0926a11a9.24819086-e1573043257779-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"dundee united sell out of tickets for fridays derby","story":"Dundee United have sold out their ticket allocation for Friday#s derby at Dens Park.The Tangerines are currently sitting at the top of the Championship after Saturday’s win at Inverness.Tickets are still available for the Hegarty Suite event, priced at £ per person.There are also a few places available at hospitality still, priced at £ per person."},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/5dc2a0926a11a9.24819086-e1573043257779-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"manhunt after teen knocked out at dundee newsagent","story":"A newsagent was sealed off by police after a teenage boy was attacked and knocked unconscious.Emergency crews attended Umars Convenience Store on Pitkerro Road, in Mid Craigie, before the -year-old boy was taken to hospital on Friday afternoon.A police spokeswoman said officers are following a “positive” line of inquiry into the incident.It is understood two men and the teenager had been inside the store before the disturbance.Staff at the store declined to comment when approached about the incident.One customer said one of the men and the teenager became embroiled in a punch-up.He added: “I came to get my paper but the shop was shut and had been closed for some time.“These were all customers who are known to go into the shop on a regular basis.“I don’t know what triggered it but by all accounts the fight went on around the shop floor.”The Tele understands the teenager continued to be attacked as he lay unconscious on the ground.The customer added: “Only one of the men was involved as far as I’m aware but the other man pulled him away.“When I came past I clocked four police officers on the scene and two paramedics.“The teenager was on his feet when I saw him leaving.“By all accounts there had been a bit of blood spilled.“Police had closed the shop off as part of the investigation.“I feel sorry for the staff members who were inside the store.”The Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “Officers are following a positive line of inquiry after a -year-old boy was assaulted in a newsagent on Pitkerro Road, Dundee, on Friday.“The victim was taken to hospital for treatment for minor injuries.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/medw-tele-sports-podcast-twa-teams-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street its a halloween special but there is nothing scary about city clubs form","story":"This week it#s a Halloween special as Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan discuss the recent upturn in fortunes for Dundee and Dundee United and take a look at all the latest results in the Scottish Premiership.Calum and George will be joined by former Dundee and Dundee United defender Lee Wilkie for next week#s Dundee derby special.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about all things Dundee and United.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/5dc003e52bbf28.90845187.jpg ","title":"string of wins lifts dees bid for top flight","story":"Following their - win over Morton on Friday night, it appears the stars might finally be aligning for Dundee.It wasn’t their best display of the season, far from it, but for manager James McPake a third win on the spin shows where he wants to take the Dark Blues.That kind of sequence is something the Dee haven’t achieved since November   when Motherwell, Hamilton and Kilmarnock were seen off consecutively in the Premiership.And James will hope stringing together Championship wins like the ones over Ayr, Alloa and Morton more often will see themto the top-flight.Although that is the long-term aim for Dundee, in this run some short-term concerns have also been addressed, with monkeys shaken off backs in the process.The - success at Ayr represented Dundee’s first away win of the season and they went back-to-back for the first time in the Championship this term as they comfortably dispatched Alloa -.Those were, undoubtedly, big steps in the Dens men’s development under new boss James, with the victory against Morton no less important.With the late collapse to a - defeat against Partick Thistle in their last home match still fresh in the memory, when Cameron Salkeld quickly cancelled out Kane Hemmings’ opener at Dens on Friday night, there may have been some doubts over Dundee’s mentality to bounce back.However, they collectively quashed all those worries with an onslaught of attacking football which finally brought the winner through Jamie Ness  minutes from time.That it was Ness who struck made it all the more sweet, given his recent injury troubles, while it also piled pressure on promotion rivals Dundee United, Ayr and Inverness for their clashes the following day.United responded excellently, downing Caley Thistle - in the Highlands, with the Honest Men enjoying a superb - win over Partick and their former boss Ian McCall on Saturday.After the weekend’s action, the Dee now lie third in the table and are in a good position for the second Dundee derby of the campaign set to play out at Dens this coming Friday night.They will want to put the first edition of the fixture back in August behind them and look in a far stronger position to do so.That it will be a - sort of game again, on the form of both teams, is out of the question.League leaders United have maintained a fair pace since that impressive win at Tannadice and lie six points clear of their city rivals.And, although the gap between the two sides before the first match, just three games into the season, was four points, the Dee are a better team now and won’t submit so easily.There has been a sea change at Dundee since a - defeat down at Morton in September and that, in no small part, is down to the acquisition of Graham Dorrans.Since the -year-old former West Brom, Norwich and Rangers man made his debut off the bench in that clash, the Dark Blues have won four games out of their last six, a draw at Queen of the South and that disappointing late loss against Partick aside.He has been fantastic in that run, with others like Kane Hemmings, Paul McGowan and Declan McDaid also stepping up to the plate on a consistent basis.Contributions from all of the above led to a perfect three wins from three last week, however, unfortunately for the Dee, United have gone toe-to-toe with them.It seems, instead of waiting for the Terrors to slip, the Dark Blues will need to take matters into their own hands soonthey are to turn promise into promotion."},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/5dbc3827ee9bd0.20475607-848x564.jpg ","title":"united defender mark connolly could make first start in months in fridays dundee derby","story":"Dundee United centre-back Mark Connolly could be in line for his first start in over two months in Friday’s derby at Dens Park.However, the -year-old will have his work cut out to displace the backline that defended so solidly in Saturday’s - win at Inverness .At the weekend, Connolly made histo first-team duties from the bench since tearing his hamstring in the last derby, a - win over rivals Dundee, on August .And boss Robbie Neilson says he could be ready for a starting spot at Dens on Friday.He said: “Mark has a reserve game tomorrow but we felt it was a good opportunity with a few minutes to go to get him out there and get him some first-team game time.“If he comes back in again, he’s had that bit of a test on his hamstring.“He’s trained magnicently and I think he’s in the best condition I’ve ever seen him, even when he was a kid at Kilmarnock. He’s really looking after himself and has been a great example to everyone so we just wanted to get him back on the pitch.”Goals from strikers Nicky Clark and Lawrence Shankland added to a first-half own goal by Caley Thistle defender Shaun Rooney as United racked up an impressive - victory in the Highlands.The goalscorers may get the plaudits but the Tannadice gaffer was delighted with the work done by his backline, giving Connolly some work to do to earn back his starting spot.Robbie added: “When you go to a place like Inverness, the backline is the most important thing for you.“Inverness put the ball up to Jordan White right on top of your back four and it can be easy to drop off. But I thought our two centre-backs and full-backs kept the game nice and tight which allowed us to get pressure on the midfield. That allowed us to push on.”Caley Thistle boss John Robertson felt Shankland could have been red-carded in the first half for an elbow on Jamie McCart.He said: “The assistant is standing  yards away and should have seen a clear elbow. It’s a tangle and maybe Lawrence is trying to free himself but, accidental or not, he has caught him with his elbow.”Robbie said: “Shanks has just tried to barge him back out of the way. The linesman was  yards away and the ref  yards away.

I remember there used to be this -seater red bus that Drew Jarvie would drive to take us out to the barracks for training.“In the winter you’d be getting on and off the bus in the snow and having to build the goals and things like that.“We’ll still get rain and snow at Westhill, but at least we won’t have to build the goals.”Considine also believes having the training facilities at Kingsford will give Derek McInnes’ first team more time to hone their skills.Currently, time constraints can be a factor in how much additional work can be done after training.McInnes has spoken previously about training at places like Aberdeen Sports Village and Spain Park, where they are only able to hire pitches for a set period of time.Now that the training ground has been completed, the Dons won’t have that problem.And Considine says it’s little things like this that make a big dference.He added: “I understand the dference it can make – you can do extra work before and after training.“Don’t get me wrong, right now Tony Docherty will take strikers to do a bit and boys will do stuff themselves at the end of training.“But then you’re on a bus for  or  minutes, back to the stadium.“It’s the same before – you do your prehab to warm up and then you go on a bus and you’re stf again and have to do a bit more when you get to training.“That might not seem like much, but it’s the little things that make a dference.“These facilities will all help, which will be fantastic.”Considine believes proper training facilities are something Aberdeen have needed for a long time.Having a training ground and also a new stadium is something that has been mooted for many years.But to finally see it delivered is something that Considine and all his colleagues are thrilled about.The first-team squad trained at Kingsford for the first time last Friday, before Saturday’s - Pittodrie victory against Kilmarnock.He said: “The players are all looking forward to it.“I’ve been here  or  years and it’s been a long time coming.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

With Mondays five matches delivering only one win it was a rather downbeat team who gathered for the team meeting that night.Stuart #The Forest# Johnston couldn#t see the wood for the trees, The Sneddon couldn#t see the goal for the hanky protecting his head from the sun, Iain #Caravan# MacDonald was thinking too much about camper vans, whilst Tom #The Gin# Kilcolm didn#t live up to his name and went nearly tea total.Captain Anderson though delivered when it mattered. With Colin #The Cat# in goal, Sneddon was deployed at the back alongside. MacDonald, Johnston and Kilcolm were pushed further forward with the captain and #The Scribe# Litster in midfield. As Dinah Washington once sang, what a dference a day makes.In their first game on Tuesday the Jerry Hatricks won -. Goals from Johnston, Anderson and Litster gave a renewed sense of hope.The second match v Algarve Tavira though was all about the captain. A fabulous five goal haul and a carpet burn saw them run out - winners.Match three versus Browns from Vilamoura was always going to be a tough test and thanks to a fantastic rearguard action from Sneddon and MacDonald, allied to goals from Litster and Johnston, Jerry Hatricks came out - victors.Knowing that victory in the penultimate match against the Lagos Tigers would all but see them through it was left to Kilcolm to make his mark. A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam. Victory was secured and Captain Anderson#s coat was no longer on that shoogly peg.Ex Liverpool legends John Aldridge and Alan Kennedy were on hand to present the trophy. Thanks were extended at the after match banquet to the organisers, Lagos Strollers Walking Football Club for an excellent tournament and to all the players for their sporting attitude throughout the matches.Remember Lochgilphead walking football takes place every Tuesday at the sports centre, .-.pm.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

It will include a new toilet, shower, laundry and kitchen building,  new camping pitches and  motor home pitches, most of which will have hook-ups.The total project will cost around £,. In addition to HIE’s contribution will be an award of £, from the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund, with the balance from IGHT.It is expected that the modern site will strengthen the local economy by an additional £, a year and that other businesses on Gigha will benefit from the increase in footfall and visitor spend.The Isle of Gigha camp and motorhome site is due to welcome its first visitors in autumn , after which it will be open throughout the year.Strategic planning to secure a strong, sustainable future for the Mount Stuart Trust and the Isle of Bute is at an advanced stage, with key decisions expected by spring .Speaking ahead of the next phase of community consultations, Colin Boag, managing director of Mount Stuart Trust, said: #We are working intensively with community groups, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Land Commission to develop a range of initiatives to improve the rural and urban landscapes on the island of Bute and to unlock growth opportunities for the local economy.#There is a great sense of purpose and commitment from everyone involved. This is matched by a desire to make progress on a number of crucial projects. The trust will conclude a strategic review by the end of the year. In conducting this - year ‘look forward’, we have been well supported through discussions with iniduals and community bodies across the island.#As part of the overall review, we are creating a specic rural strategy focussed on building a sound, sustainable future for farming and forestry on the island. Following an initial consultation with key stakeholders in July, we are developing the rural strategy through a number of joint working groups. These are examining key priorities including dairy farming, rural training and skills, forestry development and the environment.#Our emerging rural strategy builds on work completed with Argyll and Bute Council to support their bid to the Scottish and UK governments for a multi-million-pound Rural Growth Deal. Working together with the council, Fyne Futures and the Bute Island Alliance, we drew up a proposal for investment of £million to pilot on Bute a new transformative rural development model for niche food and drink and primary island industries.The trust is also consulting with local communities about the proposals to release urban land for community projects. This important work is being conducted in line with the Scottish Land Commission’s protocol on community engagement.In August, Mount Stuart Trust, with Scottish Land Commission representatives, held an urban community workshop with key community organisations in Rothesay. Discussion centred on how potential community projects could utilise land in Rothesay, which is currently in either council or trust ownership.Colin Boag added: #Throughout the discussions with ious community representatives, a number of local groups have expressed interest to make use of some or all of the land on offer. We welcome their interest in creating opportunities for positive change on the Isle of Bute.#I am confident that the depth of collaboration between Argyll and Bute Council, the Land Commission, local communities and the trust is set bring a strong sense of renewal and confidence to the island.#It was a trip to the Co-op and trollies at the ready for Lochgilphead High School pupils, as they were set a mission in aid of the Argyll Foodbank.Staff from the school ided the group of S pupils into teams, giving each an inidual budget to stick to.

Pumpkins, grown by the school#s science department, have been purchased by staff in preparation for the carving event that will take place next week. The money raised from this was then matched by school funds to give an overall budget of £.Over  items were purchased by the pupils on Thursday October , using their Young Scot cards to benefit from a  per cent discount and remembering to collect valuable points on their Co-op membership cards.The school has decided to make contributions to the food bank throughout the year, particularly focusing on Easter, Halloween and Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNumbers drawn in Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery on Monday October  were ,  and .

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"cairndows getting connected by community effort","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe end is almost in sight for a path connecting Cairndow around the head of Loch Fyne.Phase one of the path project # between the Tree Shop at Clachan and Achadunan # is already complete, but the much longer stretch between Achadunan and Cairndow village is currently being built, high above the A trunk road.Contractors have been employed to do the bulk of the work, thanks to grant funding, but  volunteers have been involved in what has become a real community effort.When complete, the five foot wide path, with a firm surface suitable for walking or cycling, will feature  bridges crossing burns and will have a specially designed crossing at the A above Cairndow village.The project, part of the Cairndow Action Plan, is on track for completion by the end of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"mod success stories from across argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEight-year-old Emma Litster from Lochgilphead competed in the Highland dancing competition on Thursday October , held at the at the Gaelic College.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

That is due to the harsh, economic reality of processing milk in an incredibly tough dairy industry that has witnessed so many casualties at both farm and processing level in recent times.#While this is very disappointing news, it is reassuring that all of the local farmers are members of First Milk and will continue to benefit from being part of a national co-operative with an evergreen contract and continuing to have their milk collected in the future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"harvest party reaps food bank donations","story":"At the group#s harvest party on Wednesday morning, each child, dressed in ious costumes, some spooky and some sweet, brought an item to donate to the food bank.Kintyre Toy Library meets every Monday and Wednesday from .am to .am, and on Thursdays from -pm, during term-time, in Springbank Evangelical Church Hall.For £ entry, children up to school age enjoy a range of arts and crafts, as well as songs and stories."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 1 2019","story":"It is devastating news for the Kintyre economy that one of the area#s biggest employers looks set to lose up to  per cent of its workforce.It must be devastating news for all CS Wind UK#s staff, with the uncertainty surrounding jobs made all the worse in the lead up to Christmas.The company#s next potential order is due for production in , so there is a future for the factory and we are sure the company is doing all it can to secure that future.Our fingers are crossed that the talks with Argyll and Bute Council, the Scottish and Westminster governments and other organisations are successful in finding a solution to the shortfall in orders.By chance, the news of redundancies at CS Wind came the same week as Amazon revealed its power purchase agreement with a Kintyre wind farm.Attempts by the Courier to confirm the location of the wind farm were unsuccessful but,it comes to fruition, it is to be hoped it will bring jobs to the area."},{"url":null,"title":"springbank and machrihanish help graces pals raise cash","story":"Two nights’ accommodation, a VIP tour and tasting at Springbank Distillery, and a round of golf for eight people at Machrihanish Golf Club were the star lot at an auction in aid of the charity.This was part of an event held by Blairmains Farm Shop and Coffee Bothy in Blairlogie, near Stirling, run by the Logan family and Meg Filshie, who are friends of Kintyre#s David Allen.David and his we Cynthia moved to Campbeltown just over six years ago when David joined Springbank#s sales team.

roundabout on the busy road.However, it was eventually decided that a bear, designed by renowned Scottish artist Andy Scott, would be created on land near the townrsquos Asda store and McDonaldrsquos restaurant, east of the roundabout.The sculpture will stand on top of a mound of earth.Ken Ross, from Hallhill Development Ltd, which is behind the proposals, told the Courier work was under way, with

Aberdeenrsquos Marischal Square.Work was delayed slightly to allow the re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar to take place last month.The sculpture, which is made of welded steel and fabricated from steel plates of ious thicknesses, is a nod towards John Muir, who was born in the town before emigrating to the USA and playing a key role in the formation of the countryrsquos national park system.Planning permission for the sculpture was originally turned down by East Lothian Council after concerns were raised that the work of art would be a distraction to drivers on the A.The decision was appealed to the local authorityrsquos local review body, where Dunbar and East Linton ward member Sue Kempson said: ldquoI find the links with John Muir extremely tenuous and I donrsquot find it particularly attractive.However, ward colleague Councillor Norman Hampshire was backed by the committeersquos other two members ndash Jeremy Findlay and Stuart Currie ndash in backing the plans, which

like an advertisement for a safari park.Fellow community councillor Herbert Coutts was more positive and pointed to the impact of the Kelpies and the Angel of the North, near Gateshead.He said: ldquoI

car parking so some of our elderly customers are not now using the library.However, the report said there were hopes that when the new housing had been completed at Wallyford, where large development

library and customer services, increasing digital use and dferent types of events taking place within libraries.It said that the number of e-magazines and e-newspapers issued through the library

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

I have edited it for publication here, but I have attempted to keep the story as close to the original as possible, and the story itself is completely the idea of the children.IN PRESTONPANS, there lived two nine-year-old children called Max and Lily.One day, they went on a bike ride to Preston Tower for a picnic. When they got there they laid a chequered blanket down on the grass, opened their basket and began to eat.They were about to leave after eating their food when they saw a robin perched on a nearby branch. It seemed friendly and the children fed the wee bird some of their leftovers.The robin then flew to a nearby abandoned cottage. The children were intrigued and followed the robin to investigate the cottage.They couldnrsquot remember noticing it before and they were wandering around it peering inside through small a gap in the wall. They couldnrsquot see where the robin had gone. They should have just left it but curiosity got the better of them and they searched for a way in. They were anxious to find out what had happened to the robin.But there was no way in, as the entrance and windows were blocked. So they clambered up the cottage wall, the bricks crumbling under their feet.Tired and exhausted, they finally reached where they thought the robin had landed.They found an opening which led to a dark passage. Despite being a bit scared, Max and Lily decided to investigate and walked down the passage. It was dimly lit by small gaps in the wall that let in narrow beams of light. At the end, there was a staircase. They huddled together as they walked.Then all of a sudden, the floorboard behind them collapsed.Now in fear and panic, they dashed up the steps of the dilapidated staircase into the attic.From the corner of the attic, they could just make out a small black figure running towards them.They thought they had seen the robin but it was something much worse. ldquoMouse! screamed Lily. Then they heard a glass shatter ndash smash!They were now terried and they sat in pitch darkness. The only light they had was the light that was seeping through the bricks in the walls.As they sat in fear, they realised they needed to come up with a plan to escape. They searched the cottage for a way out.As Lily investigated around the room, she tripped over a rug that seemed to have something poking upwards. She called out for Max and he came rushing down the stairs.As Max kneeled down to take a closer look, Lily revealed what looked like a trapdoor.Astonished, the children pulled the handle.It led to a tunnel which was flooded with candlelight. Who lit the candles  Max and Lily wonderedwhoever had lit the candles knew they were there.They entered the candlelit tunnel and one step at a time they cautiously moved forward.Then, slam! The trapdoor shut behind them and they jumped in fear. This was all too much for them to handle, they were desperate to get out.Then Max heard a soft but evil whisper: ldquoPlease stay, Irsquom lonely.In terror, he pulled out his phone and pressed  but it instantly shut off. ldquoPlease stay, said the voice, now sounding child-like.ldquoHelp! screamed Max and Lily through the gaps in the wall, but help never came.Then they heard something on the floorboards above.ldquoThere must be something up there, said Lily. ldquoI guess the only way out is to follow the candlelight.So they ventured further down the candlelit passageway.As the pair made their way through the tunnel, they could just make out what looked like a white figure approaching, who had a terrying grin with sharp teeth.Max and Lilyrsquos hearts beat uncontrollably as they sprinted away from this terrying image and as they did so all the candles blew out, throwing the children into complete darkness.Was this thing still there  The friends sat together in the darkness breathing heavily, in shock and terror.Suddenly, in the darkness, icy fingers gripped Lilyrsquos arms.ldquoWas that you rsquorsquo asked Lily. ldquoNo, replied Max.All at once, the candles lit up again. Max and Lily turned round and saw a horrying face: ldquoArghhhhhhh!They woke in the sunlight. ldquoWhat  said Max, confused. ldquoWhat just happened   added Lily.ldquoIt must have been a bad dream, said Max. ldquoBut both of us had the same dream, how is that possible ldquoWe had better go, they said.As they were about to leave, they saw a robin. They turned and looked at each other with a smirk on their faces and a chill in their bones."},{"url":null,"title":"port-seton-library-closing-refurbishment","story":"The library, situated within the Port Seton Community Centre, closes on Monday and will re-open on Monday, December .During this period, customers will not be able to borrow books or other loans however, they canany loans to staff at the community centre and the outstanding loans period will be extended during the refurbishment work.Anyone wishing to use a computer will be able to do so within the community centre.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, council spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: ldquoOur investment in the refurbishment of the library will result in it being repainted and the carpeting being replaced, which means that it has to be completely emptied for the work to be carried out.\"Loans can still be taken out or ed at any of the other branches across East Lothian and we have made sure that two PCs will be available to use within the community centre."},{"url":null,"title":"pumpkin-patch-nursery-boss-admits-defeat-closing-dunbar-nursery","story":"Jonathan Bruneau said the Dunbar branch of his Pumpkin Patch Nurseries would close permanently in two weeks after  years of looking after children in the town.The nursery was criticised in a recent Care Inspectorate report over changing staff and a lack of management.However, Mr Bruneau, who also has Pumpkin Patch nurseries in North Berwick and Haddington, said the problems had been created by Scottish Government demands.He said: ldquoUnfortunately we have had to admit defeat related to our ability to staff and manage our Dunbar setting.ldquoRecruiting management and senior staff has been impossible over recent years due to Scottish Government policies which have driven the average age and experience of nursery practitioners down to levels which are simply not appropriate to run a nursery.ldquoNursery staff work long hours for salaries which are not commensurate with the level of education and expertise they are expected to achieve.ldquoThis, plus the rolling out of , hours per year of free nursery care , has created a staffing crisis most noticeably felt in rural areas where staff cannot afford to travel from Edinburgh or beyond.ldquoThe final straw came when we lost our most recent manager after three months when she was poached by a nursery closer to home. This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

It took at least a month before I felt like I could try and pick myself up and apply for other jobs.ldquoEven then, I am inevitably asked why I left Neogen Europe and itrsquos awkward having to try and explain what happened.ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for my savings and support from family, I could have been in serious financial dficulty.ldquoThe whole thing has been an unbelievable nightmare.Ms MacAulay began working at Neogen as a research technician in , before being promoted to research scientist four years later.During that time she was described as a ldquokey member of the firmrsquos Research and Development team, with her then manager describing her as ldquovery adaptable, easy to manage, and very focused.However, in April  Dr Jay Wallace took over as the new manager of the team and things began to change.At no time did she raise any concerns directly with Ms MacAulay, but she spoke to HR about the scientistrsquos interactions and relationships with her and other members of staff.Read more:BBC lsquois facing wave of pay claim tribunalsrsquo as Ahmed case beginsAn email from HR to the then managing director Stephen Holmes in May  stated: ldquoFrom what Dr Wallace has told me there really isnrsquot anything to take her to disciplinary on, aside from perhaps failure to follow management instructions but even then it is thin and the furthest we could probably take it is a written warning which would probably lead to more animosity.It added: ldquoDr Wallace seems to be getting to the point where she canrsquot work with her anymore. The only practical way I can think to get rid of[Ms MacAulay] would be by way of a compromise agreement.The following month Ms MacAuley was told that she was being investigated by Dr Wallace.

Originally coined some years ago by older campaigners wishing for a more sustainable, secure and resilient system of food production and distribution, the -year-old Scot is taking up the baton ndash albeit it on a tiny Perthshire footprint.Four years ago, at the age of , the Dunkeld-born student became the youngest-ever finalist in the long-running reality baking show The Great British Bake-Off [GBBO]. Watched by  million viewers worldwide, she was the runner-up in the  finale and instantly became a media darling. Evidently thrilled and reassured in equal measure to have such a young woman embrace ndash in her reassuring mid-Scots accent ndash the ancient culinary art of baking using centuries-old techniques, print and broadcast commissioning editors flocked to her oven door. Her first cookbook was published, and her online presence rose faster than the lightest souffle. Here was a new domestic goddess in whose delicate hands baking was safe. The world, it seemed, was her ice-cream oyster.Then she turned the tables. Eschewing the bright lights, she has settled instead for her own tiny craft bakery in a th century village in rural Perthshire where she quietly and happily puts in a -hour day. Itrsquos from this modest ndashinfinitely pretty ndash base that she hopes to influence our relationship with food for the better.Not that shersquos about to disappear completely: with its white-painted -year-old stone walls, original black range, front door draped with garlands of dried flowers, the setting for her glass-fronted display of fresh craft bakery items, Aran, is the last word in Instagrammability. Named after the Gaelic for bread, it is also the title of her second cookbook.ldquoYeah, it was a bit of a ballsy move, she agrees of her snap decision to buy the bakery in . ldquoItrsquos been wonderful. I call it my flour oasis. Wersquore perched on little white-painted stepping stools in a corner of the busy shop floor, trying not to get in the way of the constant stream of customers ndash a combination of locals and tourists ndash looking for her trademark homemade croissants, cakes, pastries and sourdough breads which have sustainability hard-baked into every bite.Shedden put her studies on hold ndash she was doing a history of art degree at St Andrews ndash to set up Aran with her friend Angus and her boyfriend of just five months at the time, James Irvine, who now manages the Birnam Arts Centre. The pair live together in the flat above the shop. A crowdfunding campaign raised pound, for refurbishment and grants from the SSE windfarm community fund, combined with a bank loan and proceeds from her first book Gatherings, made her long-held dream possible.ldquoIrsquod immediately become jealous when Angus told me he had a lsquobread shedrsquo, a place where he would create loaves upon loaves post-work and early in the morning, she says. ldquoHis magic little set-up was exactly what I had been looking for. It took a year for the trio and other family and friends to get the bakery open.I remark on how busy Aran is, and am informed it does some  transactions a day . The elongated Scottish tourist season means they are busy all year round rather than the traditional Easter to September.ldquoPeople have no idea how much work goes into this and how much we bake every single day, she says. A production kitchen on a small industrial park up the road in Birnam has helped alleviate the flow.So far, so impressive.But Irsquom intrigued.Alongside gorgeous recipes on how to make the goodies in the bakery ndash think Whisky Eccles cakes, pistachio and lime loaf, or butternut squash and Birnam honey loafndash her new book features little drop-in biogs of her regular customers and staff, many of them men, and also of her father. So the female vibe of her previous book, in which she praised the influence of women on home cooking, seems to have morphed into something more collegiate and collaborative ndash as well as less sugary-sweet. Aran follows a day in the le of the bakery, hour by hour and ritual by ritual, and there are recipes for sandwiches, salads, savoury tarts and sandwiches ndash and a heavy emphasis on sourdough breads, brioches and croissants.So, does running a bakery span the genders  ldquoYeah, it used to be all women but the balance is more even now. In fact, I call my team lsquoThe Boysrsquo, she says. ldquoGatherings was more focused on home and family whereas this is much bigger and wider in scope and people. What wersquore doing here is definitely more collaborative. People of both genders bring in ideas and suggestions, either orally or from memory, and we try them out. Wersquore doing continual RD and things are developing organically. And in the village, the wider community spirit is strong.She makes a point of sourcing ingredients, including the all-important flour, from the community and from Scotland as much as possible. Salmon is from the Dunkeld Smoke House, honey from master beekeeper John Taylor, and fresh produce is from the organic Dunkeld and Birnam Community Growing, known as The Field, and from Blackhall Farm. Butter is from Grahamrsquos Dairies, although her Lescure patisserie butter ndash good for croissants and pastries due to its high fat content ndash is from France. With Brexit in mind, she is looking for alternative local sources to provide her with the  kilos she goes through every week.ldquoThe really important thing for us is to be sustainable, she says.Her message about eating sensibly is also strong, and she cites the Rome-based food writer Rachel Roddy and the Irish writer Diana Henry as her food heroes for their ldquosensible approach to healthy eating.In Aran, she writes: ldquoSugar gets a bad rep, as does gluten, sadly. But my principles remain the same throughout this bizarre time. Use proper and honest ingredients and think of food as a source of fuel and satisfaction, not as something to fear or discuss negatively.Kale, which she says, ldquogets all the attention by the clean-eaters, and I worry it will put people off it, features strongly in her salad section alongside squash, carrot tops, heirloom tomatoes and asparagus. Therersquos a foraged nettle and pea quiche in a nod to Scottish culinary history and nettle pudding, ldquothe oldest recorded pudding in the book, but unlikely to make a reappearance.Her misgivings echo those expressed in the  Gatherings, in which she lamented the number of people of her age-group that she knew to have eating disorders or troubled relationships with food, and how ldquoearth-shattering that could be.The equal balance between sweet and savoury in Aran is notable, and again echoes the authorrsquos desire to change perceptions that baking is all about sweetness and stodge.Does she think her peer-group ndash at almost  she is somewhere between a Millennial and the younger so-called Generation Z ndash are confused about food and diet  ldquoYes, she replies, without hesitation. ldquoI am from the generation with arguably the most delusional approach to food. Therersquos so much noise surrounding it on social media. The influencer set are hugely to blame when it comes to diet issues. People arenrsquot sure about where they stand as they receive mixed messages almost every day.With veganism gaining in popularity among Gen Zedders, does she offer vegan options  ldquoA couple, but thatrsquos not something we do massively, she replies, with an almost imperceptible sigh. ldquoApart from the fact that itrsquos very hard to cater for every possible dietary requirement, our ethos here is hugely based on local, as opposed to dietary.ldquoTherersquos quite a contentious discourse about veganism. I think itrsquos doing more damage to the planet than eating dairy from the farm  miles down the road.\"As well as her concerns about food miles, she also has health worries. ldquoI think itrsquos crazy to eliminate so many food groups at once, as veganism advocates. Itrsquos about cutting out a huge amount of the foods wersquove been eating for thousands of years. Problems seem to have occurred with the processed foods wersquove had available for the last  years. Tradition has never done us any harm. Now everyonersquos terried about their health.Sipping milky tea and casting an eye over the ever-forming queue at the counter, she continues: ldquoIt makes me laugh when people come in to our bakery looking for gluten-free. But you can eat our sourdough bread because itrsquos slow-fermented for  hours, which reduces the gluten content dramatically, is more easily digested and therefore better for your gut. I spend a lot of time trying to tell people to try sourdough because itrsquos the best thing you can possibly eat.ldquoI tell them thatthey buy a supermarket loaf they should toast it before eating it to finish off the baking. Itrsquos over-processed and over-yeasted to bake in minutes rather than days and contains  ingredients instead of just three or four. When you eat it itrsquos going to keep cooking in your stomach and make you feel heavy and bloated. Bread should never feel heavy.ldquoEverything processed is why wersquove lost touch with fresh food. E-numbers, additives, colourants, preservatives and so on are all man-made and, of course, theyrsquore going to cause damage and health problems. Naturally occurring ingredients are hardly to blame.Traditional Scottish iced gingerbread, almond and pistachio croissants and chocolate brownies are her biggest sellers. ldquoItrsquos OK to have sugar in moderation. Little and often, she says, smiling. Her own favourites are the sourdough sandwiches made fresh every day and filled with locally sourced greenery. ldquoWe donrsquot do them to order, otherwise wersquod be making cheese and ham every day, she says, grinning.She already has her eyes on the future, and hopes to open a village greengrocers soon. ldquoWe want to stay in Dunkeld and open a village store where things will be properly sourced and we can support the local area, she says. ldquoAt the moment we can only buy plastic-wrapped apples from Spain at the local Co-op. Wersquod like to further help the local growers and producers, while completing the circular system in terms of sustainability, cutting food waste and increasing food security.She concedes that shersquos in the privileged position of being in the main street of a historic village which is popular with tourists with no large supermarkets or fast-food chains to dilute her influence. The local independent butcher, smokehouse, deli and whisky shop are hardly going to do that. In fact, she believes she is part of wider grassroots movement in Scotland that is being fed ndash and in turn consumed ndash by social media.The downside of being part of the Gen Z zeitgeist is she has in the past fallen foul of social mediarsquos more unpleasant side. A self-taught cook who grew up in Dunkeld, Shedden suffered a Twitter backlash when, as a contestant on GBBO, she said shersquod forgotten to switch on the electric oven because her parents had an Aga at home that she had over  cookbooks, most of them French and that she had picked up a recipe for biscotti while travelling in Italy. Such comments resulted in the Twittersphere posting that she was ldquotoo posh, ldquotoo middle-class and ldquotoo professional ndash comments that were picked up by the tabloids.She says now: ldquoI havenrsquot been on Twitter for months. I love Instagram, itrsquos a great way to communicate and a huge part of our business comes through it. It also helped us market our Crowdfunding campaign. It is about sharing. It is far more my vibe and less threatening than Twitter.ldquoThrough Instagram it never fails to amaze me how many fantastic wee independent food places, producers and initiatives there are right across Scotland now, she adds. ldquoI think people are a lot more aware of what theyrsquore eating and where their food comes from. They are aware of sourcing and what theyrsquore putting in their systems. Theyrsquore more interested in that than in price. I like to think that from our tiny part of the planet wersquore changing things bit by bit.Aran, Recipes and Stories from a Bakery in the Heart of Scotland, by Flora Shedden, is published by Hardie Grant at pound.BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND BIRNAM HONEYWe do our absolute best to source as many local ingredients as possible, and always encourage customers to come through the door with any of their own goods.

What I was about to go on to say is that I would favour more, and I think be more likely to end up in, a situation where we have an issue by issue arrangement where we support on some things and donrsquot support on others.ldquoBut wersquoll drive a hard bargain and wersquoll stand up for Scotlandrsquos interests, and wersquoll stand up for the kind of progressive values that people across the UK think are important and wersquoll want to see a very strong position on Brexit.It emerged earlier this week that Ms Sturgeon is set to enter into discussions with the UK civil service about her priorities in the event of any deal with Labour.These include a second independence referendum and the devolution of drug powers to Scotland.Whitehall officials can speak to opposition parties as part of a long-standing convention allowing them to prepare for a potential change in government.But last night, Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ldquoIf these reports are true then Nicola Sturgeon has been wasting her time. There will be no pacts or coalitions with the SNP.ldquoLabourrsquos plan for real change will give , Scots a pay rise and deliver around poundbn worth of investment that will transform Scotlandrsquos communities and public services.ldquoWe intend to win a majority butwe end up with a minority administration, we will put that policy programme to Parliament andthe SNP donrsquot support that then they will have to explain to the Scottish people why they rejected such a transformative agenda for Scotland.There has been widespread speculation that the SNP would agree to prop up a minority Labour Government in exchange for the power to hold a second independence referendum.Speaking to journalists while campaigning in Dalkeith, the First Minister also hit out at the SNPrsquos exclusion from General Election TV debates.Her party has complained to Sky News and Ofcom about the ldquodeeply undemocratic decision not to include it.Sky News proposed a live debate between Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson, shortly after Ms Swinson said the Liberal Democrats would launch legal action against ITVit did not include her in its proposed head-to-head debate between the Tory and Labour leaders.The SNP said it has written to the head of Sky News calling for the party to be fully included in any debate, and making clear it could test the matter in the courtsit is not swtly resolved.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoI think these are big issues.ldquoWe will continue to have fairly rigorous discussions with the broadcasters ndash both about the leadersrsquo debates, but also generally just about how the SNP is reflected in the overall coverage.ldquoWe could hold the balance of power after this election.Elsewhere, the First Minister insisted she is not concerned about alienating Brexit-supporting SNP voters by adopting a firmly pro-EU stance.Asked whether she feared the party would face a backlash, after earlier comments that % to % of SNP supporters also backed Brexit, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoNo I donrsquot - I donrsquot worry.

They give birth to a single calf each year, and those that reproduce earlier in the year have more offspring over their letime.This is partly because of an association between the genes that causes the hinds to give birth earlier and higher overall reproductive success.As a result, genes for breeding earlier have become more common in the Rum red deer over time.Professor Pemberton said: ldquoWe are seeing hinds respond dferently during their letimes. A female that has a calf on a certain date in a cold year will have a calf on an earlier date following a warm summer. Something is changing that the animals are responding to and it seems to be the summer temperatures before the rut which is promoting grass growth.After a warm summer, the animals are coming into oestrus earlier, mating, conceiving and birthing earlier but after cold summers the findings were reversed, said Professor Pemberton.She said: ldquoSome of the changes wersquore seeing is because things are getting warmer and the animals are responding to that in their letimes, which wersquore calling plastic change.Traditionally the calving season has been from mid June but due to the altered environmental conditions, researchers have noted the season beginning as early as late May.The study also shows that the rutting season, antler casting and cleaning are all shting ndash and by a very similar time.The findings indicate that red deer could continue to thrive under changing weather: ldquoIn principle,the population can evolve, which is very strongly suggested by the data, then it will allow it to do well under changed environmental conditions.But more research on the impact of winter weather would need to be carried out to understand the final consequences of climate change.The study is unique in that it is teasing out the ious dferent causes of the calving changes, although researchers across the world are investigating how organisms are adapting to environmental change.Professor Pemberton said: ldquoThere has been a lot of discussion on whether animals are going to be able to change genetically and fast enough so this would be an indication that perhaps they will be able to.The research, published in the PLOS Biology journal, was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council.Sally Thomas, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos director of people and nature, said: ldquoThese findings are a fascinating example of the impact climate change may be having on wildle.ldquoMore and more research is demonstrating climate change is influencing species across the UK and the world. We are seeing growing evidence of the effects on Scotlandrsquos nature.ldquoSome species are finding it dficult to deal with changes, while others are moving northwards as conditions begin to change."},{"url":null,"title":"everyones-loser-brexit-general-election-race","story":"OK: Europe was always going to dominate, but why do all the parties seem to lose any sense of reality as soon as they talk about it :Brexit lsquocould mean border checks between England, Scotland and WalesrsquoJeremy Corbyn made a valiant effort yesterday to pretend that Brexit was really about the NHS. Malign forces are gathering in Mordor, in the shape of American pharmaceutical companies, waiting for their Dark Lord Trump to gobble up the NHS and force costly medicines down our throats.The Labour leader then came out with a claim that Brexit would cost the NHS pound million extra per week in higher medicine costs.

And thatrsquos not me talking, but the Nuffield Trust, the leading NHS think tank.Nor is there a serious risk of American pharmaceutical companies forcing up the cost of medicines through open competition, as Mr Corbyn claims. The reason, according to the Nuffield, is because competitive tendering for drug prices has been going on for decades, and the NHS does very well out of it.

The reason, according to the Nuffield, is because competitive tendering for drug prices has been going on for decades, and the NHS does very well out of it. As the biggest health-care purchaser on the planet, it gets the best prices from Big Pharma.The purpose of all this was to ert attention from Labourrsquos actual policy on Brexit, which is not to have any policy at all. ldquoWe recognise why people voted Leave we recognise why people voted Remain, said Labourrsquos Employment spokeswoman, Laura Pidcock, yesterday. ldquoWe are not the party of either: we are the party of both.Therersquos a philosophical debate to be had on whether it is possible to be both for and against Brexit.

The music tracks have been laid down in two volumes, a selection of which are being performed by O#Rourke and Downes as part of their live tour.Robertson said: #I love the way the  project has built new layers of creativity and performance on my original collection of stories.#It#s been a total joy and privilege to work with these talented musicians, and I am still astonished that my words have provoked such a rich range of responses in Aidan#s compositions.# raquoThere is no doubt music plays a very important part of the Shetland way of le, and the bringing together of people to enjoy the beautul sounds and feelings music invokes. It also, I feel, gives a reflection of history and a way of le many do not know about. Learning about a tune or song can be just as important in terms of its history, but moreover, why it was composed in the first place and the impact it had on the composer or people playing the tune on their fiddle, guitar or any other instrument long afterwards. There is no doubt music has one of the most powerful influences either to the inidual or as a group or more due to the harmony of sound to this of what feelings it stirs up within you. Music, the sound psychology of emotion and feeling##.what can be stronger Bobis Johnson is music to the country#s ears.David,you areabsolutely correct. To take your comment a little further, I would say that the Arts are capable of contributing much more to human le and activity than has ever been so in the past.We are rapidly becoming slaves to science as well as being beneficiaries of its wonderful contributions to le in its widest sense.The attempts that we see to put one on a higher plane than the other are futile.Every facet of human endeavour should be in the mix with the aim of formingrounded rather than fragmented people.Very well put Haydn! The Arts also let people see their inidual and collective issues, wants and needs from dferent perspectives, so also assist democracy.Expressing our creativity is also a FUNdamental part of being human, and happily there are good dancers, singers and storytellers everywhere.If humanity is to survive and prosper an understanding of the Sciences and of the STEM subjects, is vital. Sadly our political classes are mostly in ignorance of the sciences, at every level. Their bizarre and idiotic decisions display that so well. A simple example, Shetland Island Council promotes and acquires battery-powered cars to reduce CO emissions. It only has, at this time, fossil fuel-generated power to charge them with, the result.an increase in CO footprint. How scientically mindless and stupid.Oh and don#t get me started on electric cars. I#ve driven a so called gas guzzler for years. I#ve not seen any so called climate change myself, yet still I drive. It still snows in winter does it not, yet the #green# lobby would have us believe that it will be raining frogs by we don#t change our ways. What utter tosh.Actually Jerry, the winters in Shetland are exceptionally mild these days. You can, literally, count on your hands the number of days it snows. Whether this is due to human activity and this of global warming is maybe questionable, BUT the evidence would suggest it probably is the case human activity being the major cause Is there a connection, overall,between global warming and much milder winters  I sincerely hope global warming is not a situation where, like most progression, some massive disaster has to take place before we do something about Maybe there’s a touch of the prophet in his own country not being recognised.Do I detect a wee bit of sarcasm there, Haydn  lolCan the SIC backing transition to battery powered cars reasonably be described as #bizarre and idiotic# Maybe Ian Tinkler hasn#t fully thought this through.The council#s decision to buy some electric cars helps to extend the necessary infrastructure across the isles, meaning Shetland becomes more ready to welcome visitors with electric cars.The incentives to change over will probably improve and more people will want to swap over.They will need the infrastructure which the SIC#s decision to acquire a greener fleet supports. Shetland#s own generated electricity can and will become cleaner overtime, so it seems a little hard to justy Ian#s claim that the council#s decision was #scientically mindless and stupid#.Its still not entirely clear what self-proclaimed scientic expert Ian#s beliefs and motives are, but climate change deniers might well describe preparing for the future as #bizarre and idiotic#. If Ian can#t come up with a dferent tune, perhaps he can change the record.Perhaps it may just be an intelligent option to wait until Shetland has a clean, non-diesel, power generating capacity be for investing tens and tens of thousands of pounds in an electric car fleet! Especially when tunning these cars vans produce a greater carbon footprint than diesel engine cars would in any case.. A bit too deep for you Peter  Visiting Shetland with electric cars has nothing to do with whatever transport fleet the SIC operate. After all, we have a good towage fleet, when batteries run flat.I agree with Ian. Does this mean he has changed his mind on the Viking wind farm then I see Shetland council have taken delivery of  electric cars. No cars were tunned . They were new.Buying new diesel cars would not have a lower carbon footprint versus buying new electric cars. The embodied energy to produce and ship both is similar. Yes,the electricity is produced through burning fossil fuels it means they are not zero emissions once delivered. But they soon will be as long as Ian doesn#t get his way with Viking. Of course, Ian will not be around to see the worst effects of climate change so can afford to worry about his views. Far more important than the future of humanity, when you balance it up## self-proclaimed scientic expert!!#, your word Peter, just graduate knowledge. Any youngster with Standard Grade science subjects would understand my points, Peter Hamilton. Clearly The STEM subjects were well outside your teaching brief. Was it #Arty subjects# you taught perchance  It is#bizarre and idiotic# to use battery cars when your power source is diesel generated. You actually increase your carbon footprint! Simples. Now ask any well-educated youngster and they will explain the science to you.#Simples# Well that is a scientic proof Popper would have been proud of!I think the personal attacks on Peter and his educationonly make your point stronger. I am a well educated youngster. I agree with you entirely. Peter is wrong, you are right. Simples.Second Law of Thermodynamics should even be understood by a lecturer in childcare.!!.."},{"url":null,"title":"mixed results down south for netball team ","story":"Shetland netball players have been down south this weekend, but there were mixed results for the team during the opening stages of the Scottish Cup qualier in Edinburgh.Shetland beat Glasgow rivals Avon in the first of two games, securing a final whistle score of -.However, it later lost - to another central belt team, Bellahouston.Shetland will only find out in the coming weeksthe results were good enough to qualy for the cup.Team member Sanna Aitken said the trip had been well worthwhile, whatever the results.#It has been fantastic to travel down and play against some tough opposition today,# she said.#It is a great opportunity for our team to experience a high standard of netball and it’s always good to play against new opposition as well as meeting well-known rivals.#These opportunities allow us to develop our skill level and also gives us a chance to reflect on our style of play.#.."},{"url":null,"title":"povery and climate change dominate hustings meeting ","story":"Around  people attended a hustings debate on Saturday, where those standing in the Lerwick South by-election faced questions on issues including poverty, climate change and transport.Five candidates – Gary Robinson, Caroline Henderson, Arwed Wenger, Frances Valente and Stephen Flaws – have put themselves forward for the seat.The first question came from Lerwick Community Council member Averil Simpson, who raised the issue of food banks – and specically what needed to be done to ensure people did not require to use them.Mr Flaws said fuel poverty and #in-work poverty# was prevalent throughout the isles.#The government have to recognise that in Shetland we have additional costs and that has to be reflected,# he said.The government have to recognise that in Shetland we have additional costs and that has to be reflectedSTEPHEN FLAWS#We have to start small to tackle the bigger problem. I do think the government has to recognise the costs up here.#Ms Henderson described food bank usage as #shocking in this day and age#, and highlighted the Trussel Trust – the organisation behind the food bank – which had data on who is accessing the service.#Once you#ve got clearer information on the problem you can look at ways of dealing with it.#She described as #a sin# that perfectly good food was being thrown out by supermarkets just because it was at or near its sell-by date.Mr Robinson said the government#s roll-out of the universal credit was at the #root cause# of the problem.#It#s been an absolute shambles. How they expected folk could go for weeks without any money at all, just with the the promise it would be sorted out, I think is disgraceful.#He said the much-maligned #bedroom tax# had also been a contributing factor, and added it was important for people both in public and private sectors to have a fair living wage.Ms Valente said she had been shocked by the numbers of people who needed to use the food bank but were too ashamed of their poverty.#The cost of housing is one of the things I find quite shocking,# she said, adding that people needed to #earn a huge amount of money# to put a roof over their heads.She was also #appalled# by universal credit, and added it was wrong for society to #really target# or make people feel bad about being poor.Mr Wenger said people were encouraged to go to Citizens Advice Bureau, which could advise people on how to manage their finances.But Debra Nicolson, who stood as the Green candidate in the recent Holyrood campaign, pressed for more information on what candidates would doelected.Other questions were asked about the stigma attached to free school meals, and how it can be tackled.Ms Valente said responsibility lay with the government, but stressed the council needed to ensure social work staff and support services were fully prepared to help.Mr Robinson pointed to the -plus housing waiting list, and stressed affordable housing was key to solving the problem.Ms Henderson added there was an #antiquated rule# in the council that a percentage of the housing stock had to be kept free in case there was an emergency, and added she had argued that should be scrapped because #people need houses now#.Mr Flaws added there would always be a stigma until people are prepared to talk more openly about it.Mr Wenger said beating stigma, and preventing discrimination, needed to start at an early age. He added SSE had raised energy prices three times in one year, and stressed the issue should be picked up in the council.A former councillor, Iris Hawkins, wondered how well the candidates would adjust to #le in the goldfish bowl.#Mr Wenger said many people knew him already as a postman and as a tourist guide. He said he was a member of Transition Shetland.As a German, he said people had noticed his lack of Shetland dialect, although he admitted having problems with English accents, too.#The most problems I have with the English isI look down to the #sooth-moothers# at  Downing Street#.Ms Valente said being a councillor meant #you can#t win#, because pleasing one person would mean upsetting another.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep at night with a clean conscience.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep well at night with a clean conscience# FRANCIS VALENTEMr Robinson has #been there before#. He said the hardest thing was the impact being a councillor can have on elected members# families.#You do have to really know what you#re in for.#Mr Flaws said he had read the hardest part was putting yourself forward in the first place.#To actually make the decision and say #this is the time. It suits me now#. Once that#s done you just have to get on with it.#As for Ms Henderson, she stressed she would be #very happy# to be accountable from the start.#There will be no curtains in my goldfish bowl,# she said.The site of a new Gilbert Bain Hospital was then brought up by chairman Jim Anderson, with Mr Robinson – who chairs NHS Shetland – left feeling distinctly on the spot.#I think wherever the site is it needs to be somewhere that is close to,not within, Lerwick. That#s going to be one of the real challenges.#Mr Wenger had his eye across the Bressay Sound.#Build the fixed link to Bressay, and build the Gilbert Bain Hospital on Bressay,# he told Mr Anderson.Mr Flaws admitted there were few options on where the hospital could be built.#You have to be looking on the outskirts of Lerwick – the south road or the north road.#Ms Valente said there was no easy solution.#I suspect any decision to build the hospital is going to be  years down the road.#Ms Henderson said any consideration needed to be #future-proofed#. But she said she was prepared to look outside of the town for the solution.#If you#ve got really good shuttle links that would ease some of the congestion. If you have it nearer Tingwall it#s more central for the rest of the islands.#If you have it nearer Tingwall it#s more central for the rest of the islands# CAROLINE HENDERSONGreen issues were raised by Debra Nicolson, who said the SIC#s economic strategy was supportive of Sullom Voe and the gas plant until at least . Where did the candidates stand on this in light of the climate emergency Mr Flaws said he believed that was why the council had not yet declared a climate emergency.#The council is going to have to update its carbon management plan and see how it is going to bring this forward.#The council needs to be more transparent on what their long-term thinking is.#Part of the discussion focused on the Viking Energy windfarm.Ms Henderson said it was dficult to address Sullom Voe #until they#ve said what they want to do#.She added she was #not a fan# of the inter-connector, and the Viking windfarm was #not a green scheme – it#s only green in the context of money#.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the council should declare a climate emergency #and not worry about the oil companies#.He said BP had a #huge solar arm# in its organisation, while Total also promoted its environmental credentials and the Danish Dong Energy had gone completely out of the oil and gas sector.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything– GARY ROBINSONMr Wenger said Sullom Voe helped provide the UK with oil and gas.But he said attitudes were changing, particularly with a growth in electric car usage.#Electricity you can produce without burning fossil fuels is the best.#Ms Valente said it was impossible to get rid of fossil fuels #over night#, but stressed thinking had to start now.#Maybe Shetland can do without Sullom Voe but the economy of Britain still depends on that. We need to bring it down and work on other solutions.#But I think the council does need to declare a climate emergency.#Questions were also raised on ferry links to the mainland, with concerns voiced about the number of cabins and the freight constraints.Ms Valente said the boats were #not fit for purpose,# and added capacity for freight was #dreadful#.Mr Robinson said Shetland should be able to design a ferry to suit its own needs. He said the real problems with NorthLink vessels lay at constraints at Aberdeen Harbour, as well as regulations which limited where on a vessel cabins could be placed.#To my mind we really should have the power locally to resolve our own ferry service, so we can design something that works for us.#Mr Flaws said the ferries were commissioned roughly  years ago. He said it was dficult for his family of five to get away on the ferry.#They#re just not fit for purpose. We need to say what we need rather than be told what we should be using.#Discussion also focused on the bus service, with support for cheaper – or even,possible, free – buses being offered.Mr Flaws said it would be good to see more people using buses.#If it was cheaper or free then maybe more folk would be using it. If that was an incentive to get more folk on it, then that should be looked at,# although he acknowledged some bus times did not suit everybody.Ms Valente cited an occasion when she lived in Sandveien when the bus could get her to work just before am.#They they changed the service, so that actually you either had to get to work by half eight or half nine. It#s just ridiculous. I do not know how that happened.#Mr Wenger said e-buses – smaller units which can be called upon using an app – should be adopted. He added he had enjoyed a positive experience with an electric bike.Mr Robinson – a convert to the bike himself – said there was no easy answer on buses.#The last thing you want to do is run a bus with three folk on it when in actual fact that#s causing a bigger carbon footprint than a car with three folk in it.#He berated the absence of any buses in Shetland that ran on anything other than diesel. He cited Dundee, which had a number of electric taxis.Questions were raised about how a councillor might get things discussed with other members.Mr Robinson said climate change was something he would consider attempting to raise a notice of motion over – a measure which would ensure the topic is debated in the chamber.#That is one thing the council has failed to move on so far. I suspectyou were to canvas the councillors and ask them to sign it, you#d probably get half the councillors for a start. I fail to understand why they#ve not moved on it. It#s ridiculous.#Mr Flaws said an issue that kept coming back was that people had no idea what the council#s strategy was with sustainable energy.#It#s Viking Energy, or it#s nothing,# he said.Ms Valente said she wanted to ensure everyone#s house was insulated.#There are people living in houses that are cold. There are people who can not afford to do it and are choosing between putting the heating on and having something to eat.#Mr Wenger said council office buildings should be insulated, but Ms Henderson said it was important to deal with the issues constituents bring forward. raquoInteresting, with fuel poverty so high on the agenda Gary Robinson wants to declare a #climate emergency# causing the SIC to spend scarce money on #tackling climate change#. However, the UK government has already set its #net zero # target into law, as recommended in the IPCC#s  Special Report. The Scottish government has gone even further with #net zero #. This will cost UK energy consumers over £ trillion# enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years! # causing fuel poverty to continue to soar.SIC will be allocated compulsory government targets, to achieve the above aims. Any SIC action beyond that would be superfluous and not scientically justied i.e. motivatedby virtue-signalling. SIC should spend any spare resources on alleviating fuel poverty, already % of Shetland homes, and set to expand dramatically with the above targets.I#m surprised Mr Robinson, chairman of NHS Shetland, shows such cavalier disregard for those infuel poverty when over , people died of coldin the much milder climate of England and Wales, in  .The fuel poverty buck stops there, people die unnecessarily.The #excess winter deaths I referred to are shocking and were due to people#s inability to heat their homes adequately. These are people infuel poverty.Were , people to die during a summer heat wave, the #climate emergency# fraternity would become apoplectic and there would be a frenzy of closing down every means of using fossil fuel. But winter deaths are nothing new and these people are poor, so perhaps, they don#t count .As explained above, #climate emergency# does not come from the IPCC. It is a fad of the well-off, the bourgeoisie, who care nought for the fate of the poor but wish solely to use it as a ruse to win middle class votes using alarmist rhetoric.The Shetland Partnership has a specic objective of reducing fuel poverty by a third, by  # how is that progressing And a further aim of halving it by   Aye!The SIC and NHS Shetland are key members of the Shetland Partnership and councillors need to focus on fuel poverty as, not only will this aim not be achieved, the situation will become much worse, as a result of current government climate policy..."},{"url":null,"title":"americana artist returns for double header ","story":"One of Scotland’s finest exponents of Americana music is ing to the islands for two intimate shows this week.Glasgow-based singer-songwriter Daniel Meade will be accompanied by guitarist Lloyd Reid for concerts at The String in Lerwick on Thursday and Friday night, supported by Adam Guest and Sheila Henderson respectively., last year. was single of the week on BBC Radio Scotland.#We have worked up a large repertoire of material over the years that we dip into depending on the occasion and audience#, said Meade.#Upbeat, downbeat and everywhere in between, these shows will be mainly leaning on material from the three most recent albums we’ve released.#.."},{"url":null,"title":"emergency services alerted after cliff incident ","story":"A woman has been rescued from clfs in the South Mainland after getting into dficulty on Wednesday afternoon.Coastguard teams had been alerted and the rescue helicopter scrambled after the woman became stranded near Exnaboe.Shetland Coastguard said the woman was taken from the clf by a hi-line transfer, which allowed her to be taken safely into the helicopter.The Lerwick Leboat was providing cover off-shore.Ambulance personnel and coastguard representatives are manning the emergency landing site in Lerwick, where the casualty was taken before being transferred to the Gilbert Bain Hospital..."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191028_101405.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOVAT-STUART-MACDONALD-2-adj.jpg","title":"shinty hurling to take centre stage as scotland visit face ireland this","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTwo Kinlochshiel players, Finlay MacRae and Donald Nixon, are in the Scotland squad for the senior shinty-hurling match.At under- level Alan MacRae has named a -man squad seeking to seal a second win in succession against the Irish.Skye#s William MacKinnon is in line for his debut, while there is also a place in the squad for Johnnie MacAskill, the ex-Kinlochshiel player, now playing for Glasgow Mid Argyll.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

Liz said that the old graveyard had always interested her.Its such an enchanting place and great for telling some spooky tales at this time of the year.It is actually a lovely, reflective place to visit at any season but at this time of year it’s the perfect place for a storyteller to deliver some tales about the living .. and the dead.Liz stressed the importance of being respectful in the cemetery vicinity as it is a burial ground.When we are in the graveyard we have to remember the people who are resting there as we talk about them. “Although we are storytelling we are also showing respect for all those who have gone before.Liz is a master story teller, and finds it hard to think of her favourite scary tale, however she said she does enjoy the fanmous local story of the Crebilly headless horseman.Never using a script, Liz explained she always adjusts her stories to her audience. When we go on the Halloween story walk I always try to pick stories that are suitable for the situation and for our location, so hopefully everyone enjoys my spooky tales with a very distinctive local flavour!

I really trust him and the cast can see how his mind works as a director.”Known for her comedic roles, Katie spoke of how it was great to sink her teeth into a dramatic role. “This is a real love story of a middle class Protestant who falls in love with an Irish rebel – and we’ll leave it there,” she laughed.“I don’t want to give too much away. Myself and fellow actor Maria Connolly are on stage the whole time, linking the threadsyou like. It is such a lovely piece of writing by Kate.“Kate’s son Sean, one of the forces behind the Dead Rabbit Bar in New York, will be offering an Irish coffee before the show courtesy of the bar as well. It is a very limited run, just over two nights, but it’s wonderful that audiences will be able to see Kate’s final work.”The piece, produced by GBL Productions’ Briege Lynch, is an emotional one for all involved as Briege said she knew Kate since she was four.“I’m very honoured to have Betrothed as my first producing credit,” she said. “I’ve known and loved Kate since I was four running in and out of the Community Arts Forum offices as a young child where my dad, Martin, was director and Kate was the administrator. I probably got under her feet a lot but she was always so kind and caring and would sneak me treats. I’m sad that she isn’t here to bask in the glory of getting this writing from the page to the stage.”Betrothed by Kate Muldoon runs at the Grand Opera House in the Baby Grand from November  and .

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment.

Not only for reducing claims but also for the reputational harm any wrongful arrest or any damage to property can cause within a community.\"Superintendent Jon Burrows told the BBC the payments were \"entirely dferent\" from police misconduct and wrongdoing and were not reflective of bad or unethical policing.For cases classied as \"assault by police\" he explained that was a legal classication in which someone was injured when it was not their fault, as opposed to a criminal assault and the use of \"deliberate and excessive force\".One possible example, he said, could be where a police officer has arrested someone, handcuffed them and then slips and falls injuring that person. Also, an arrest could be made \"in good faith\" with information obtained and the use of force required and later the information received was incorrect and the arrest considered unnecessary.He admitted there could be a crossover between the payments and claims of police misconduct.\"The vast majority... relate to purely civil matters,\" he said, pointing to a falling level of complaints made to the Police Ombudsman - which investigates allegations of wrongdoing.\"There is a dferent legal framework for dealing with allegations of assault by police,\" he said.He explained claims may be settled for examples such as a search of property when they had the wrong information as to who lived at the address and given the speed officers acted \"mistakes are made\".\"And we would want to make redress for any damage done and there is a legal channel to do that and we engage with claimants to that,\" he said.\"Policing is a human endeavour. We have nearly , officers dealing with , calls for service, arresting thousands of people a year, searching thousands of people, searching many properties, seizing property and in the transactions we conduct sometimes mistakes are made.\"He said at times information may be incorrect or incomplete and at times there are system or human errors.\"We have to make redress by people that are affected,\" he said.\"And it is right and proper that an accountable police service that wherever we do something that does have an impact on some one  that we are held accountable and where appropriate we make monetary redress for any injury or damage we have caused.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

We have yet to come up with a better system but we are open to finding alternatives that are viable and affordable,” he said.“In recent weeks, we have seen some of those challenges in communities across the country. If people fear that their community, their identity is under attack, they will respond in ways that we can understand.“Too often, the sad reality is that the alternative is what happens in France and Greece and Italy which are camps and containers and I am determined we never reach that point in Ireland.”He said the Government is seeking input from Ireland’s migrant community on improving standards in Direct Provision and that newer centres have higher standards.“Newer accommodation offers own door, self catering accommodation and that is exactly what we want to have for everyone as everyone should have their own door and be able to cook and prepare their own food,” he said.Mr Varakdar criticised the recent protests being held against direct provision centres.“Too often, and I have to say it does concern me – is that we see people opposing accommodation centres in their neighbourhood or blocking migrants from moving into the local hotel under the guise of humanitarianism and opposition to Direct Provision,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the government is working to engage with communities where direct provision centres will be placed “to show how their town or village or parish will be enhanced enough diminished by the arrival of newcomers”.He said: “It’s never said, but I think it is worth saying. There are no protests at communities that already have accommodation centres. The fear evaporates, when people meet the reality, and particularly when they meet people who are that reality.“I think we need to engage better with communities and listen to respond to their concerns. That has to be done by government. That’s our responsibility.”Mr Varadkar also warned against those from the far-right who are coming to communities where direct provision centres will be placed to stoke up dissent.“Scaremongering needs to be called out by those who seek to exploit local concerns for their own political, personal, or in some cases, racist reasons,” he said.He also said the government “stands firmly against illegal immigration” into Ireland.He added: “It should not be a controversial thing to say but apparently it is sometimes – that you support legal migration and you don’t support illegal immigration.“We will step up our efforts to stop people being trafficked illegally into Ireland by gangs and also those who seek to enter Ireland unlawfully no matter how small that number might be.”Mr Varadkar spoke about his own background, as the son of an Irish woman and an Indian immigrant and growing up as “a person of colour” in Dublin.He said that by becoming leader of the country, he showed what is possible for migrants coming to Ireland.He said , people have become Irish citizens since  and some , people who came here undocumented have since been regularised last year under a new scheme.Mr Varadkar said while many migrants coming to Ireland work in healthcare and technology, more efforts should be made to encourage people from migrant backgrounds to join the civil service, the Garda and the Army.He added that additional funding should also be given to political parties that encourage people from migrant backgrounds to stand as candidates in local elections."},{"url":null,"title":"syrian medical student who lived in direct provision hopes to inspire others","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s very tough and I know it’s not an ideal solution at all. It’s far from ideal but I think it’s great that Ireland is willing to bring in refugees, and afford them all the opportunities,” she said.“I’m a perfect example of taking advantage of the opportunities the Irish Government has given me to pursue my third level education and to even be eligible for a bursary like this and to treat me as one of their own,” she said.Ms Alshleh said when she completes her studies, she wants to stay and work in Ireland as it is her home now, adding: “I definitely want to stay here. I know it might sound a little cheesy, but I do want to contribute and give back to the community that has given me so much.” Mr McHugh said: “I hope she enjoys her studies at such a prestigious institution as the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland. “Professor Campbell’s legacy is something that we should build on and by supporting students like Suaad and others in the coming years, we can do that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"election highlights a resignation is no way to kick off a campaign","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He sent heartfelt greetings from the Christian community to the Baacutehaacutei community on the occasion of the th anniversary of the birth of the Baacuteb. His kind greetings were reciprocated by the MC for the evening Dr Les Gornall, from Ballymoghan in Magherafelt. Dr Gornall provided a short history of the Baacuteb, one of the twin founders of the Baha’i Faith and the example of the Baacuteb’s disciples. Many were killed for their belief.Catalina Suarez also performed on the night with a rendition of ‘She moved through the Fair’.The work of the local Baha’i community was illustrated and one of the Magherafelt Baha’is, Alison Norgate, sang one of the popular settings of the Baha’i writings ‘Blessed is the Spot’, to much applause. Introduced as ‘The Heart of Rathlin’, Poet Mary Cecil read three of her poems beginning with The Poets Dream.The Northern Ireland Baha’i Community has worked hard to put the province on the map and the new film by the Baha’i International Community focused on the work being done.A section of the film Dawn of the Light’ was introduced by one of its stars, Jamie Anderson from Belfast. The film is now available on YouTube. The last and perhaps the most entertaining section was traditional Irish music by the Bellaghy Music Group under the leadership of Leo Neeson.Everyone went away energised and happy.

It is an honour and privilege to do the work I do. “It is a wonderful feeling to help people, and so fantastic to share skills and techniques with children at a young age that they can carry with them and use for the rest of their lives.”Sarah says she hopes other schools in the area get on board with the Minding Mini Me, Overcoming Anxiety for Kids workshop.“We all go through so many ups and downs in le andchildren are aware of how they can help themselves, it gives them a much better chance to develop resilience to tackle what comes their way. “My own personal challenges due to having Multiple Sclerosis mean I have to draw on these skills regularly and I would like to share this with the children. “I want them to know that disability does not have to hold you back and the importance of being respectful of others with challenges. “This will all fit inreally well with the schools ethos and the fact they are marking anti bullying week when I am doing the workshops.”The Minding Mini Me workshops will take place on Wednesday, November  and Friday, November . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

DUG states: “University provision is necessary to transform this. In the past three decades, Ireland’s other ‘Atlantic Coast’ cities - Cork, Galway and Limerick – have seen their student numbers soar in tandem with their local economies. “Derry Strabane has a total population of ,, with a third-level student population of, at best, ,. “Corkhas a population of , and, with the opening of a new campus in , will have a third-level student population of approximately , – ten times that of the North West. It has an outstanding reputation for its cultural, tourism and recreational facilities.”It says that Derry  Strabane Council’s Strategic Growth Plan is “entirely dependent” on university expansion which doesn’t seem to be forthcoming, with Derry’s student numbers, “already the worst on the island”, dropping again.Cold water has also been poured on Magee expansion by Head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, when he cast doubt over the long-promised Medical School build.Meanwhile, figures published by the Department for the Economyshow , NI students were in higher education in England, Scotland or Wales in  - a ten-year high.And according to the latest statistics, Derry Strabane is the only region of the North that is a net exporter of its young people.“UU has categorically failed to make any progress on its  promise to have , students at Magee by ,” the DUG says. googletag.cmd.push Curriculum Courses at a new independent university must, the group says, offer as broad an academic programme as is practical, reflecting the traditions, strengths and specialisms of the region within its curricula.Therefore, it envisages a full syllabus boasting courses in Medicine, Law, IT, Engineering, Arts, Commerce, but also specialise in and promote courses which are unique to Derry.Long-standing engineering traditions, evident in the City Walls and homegrown engineering companies such as EI, Seagate and InVistashould be reflected.In terms of innovation, Derry currently houses two science parks, conducting research in Articial Intelligence, robotics, virtual augmented reality. “It was the first Irish city to partner with MITto pursue research into D printing, currently running a number of Fab-Labs in schools and communities. “Thousands of people work in IT business support in the North West, with Pramerica employing , people in North Donegal.”There would also be courses in Irish History with Derry being Ireland’s longest continuously inhabited Christian settlement, and the region once home to a number of High Kings in the Middle Ages. These would be complemented by courses in Marine Military History.As a region “bursting with creative talent” Arts, Drama and Music courses are also high on the agenda.The document cites Derry’s reputation as an international leader in modern literature and conflict resolution - with Nobel laureates in both disciplines.Literature  Philosophy, Conflict Resolution  Trauma Relief, Conflict Journalism and Tourism  Heritage are amongst a plethora of subjects synonymous with the city which could be taught at an independent university. Bridging the border The DUG believes there is an urgent need to mitigate against Brexit by ‘bridging the border’ with a new independent university in the North West, recognised and supported by both the Irish EU and British governments, which would have “the freedom and autonomy to serve, andin, both jurisdictions.“Such a facility, centred in Derry, would immediately establish a partnership with the existing Letterkenny Institute of Technology, less than  miles away. The parent university could apply to become a constituent member of both the National University of Ireland and Universities UK. “This would allow it to benefit from both organisations’ administrative expertise. Formal links with southern institutions would, moreover, solidy the European identity of Northern students and, post Brexit, would help protect the rights of Irish citizens in the North as per the Good Friday Agreement.“It is time to renew and regenerate our powerful scholastic legacy. It is time to repudiate the Lockwood Report and correct this historical travesty by immediately establishing a new, independent university.”The Derry University Group has lobbied London, Dublin and US government officials calling for the establishment of a new city-region university. It has made presentations to the Irish government calling for the new university to become a constituent of the National University of Ireland. The group has received official recognition from Derry City and Strabane District Council and the international Derry-Donegal diaspora association Futureproof North West.In , following visits to the North West by the British Labour peer Andrew Adonis and frontbench MPs Mike Amesbury and Mike Kane, Lord Adonis told the Upper House that the decision to deny Derry a standalone university was a “scandal”. He also called for a review of Higher Education provision in the North which has since been published.

A spokesperson for Void gallery said: Jarman’s apocalyptic, postcolonial depictions of the ‘fall of England’ - reflecting the country’s desire toto its ‘Imperial days’ - are ever present in the current political landscape, from Brexit, parliamentary suspensions and the absence of a government at Stormont, to the rise of nationalism, fascism and state surveillance. We are at an impasse in Northern Ireland and are once again at the mercy of Westminster decision-making. googletag.cmd.push The film references the AIDS epidemic and the collective trauma that was experienced at that time. It was originally going to be titledGBH The Last Of England,reflecting the destruction of the landscape and culture of England, and more personally the body through AIDS. Jarman said the GBH could stand for “whatever you want it to: grievous bodily harm, great British horror, gargantuan bloody H-bomb”. Instead, he used the GBH title for his painting series, depicting the map of England in ious stages of being inflamed.In exhibiting these works,it punctuates this particular moment in Britians political history, to show the parallels in the political struggle from then and now. The legacy of Jarman’s work and gay rights activists both past and present are demonstrated in recent societal and legislative changes with the legalisation of gay marriage in the North.

It paves the way for the Council to engage formally with Central Government to request financial assistance to secure the sustainability of the City of Derry Airport beyond  March . At the meeting, members agreed toapprove a maximum additional underwrite of funding for CODAbetween now and st March  of poundk from in-year capital savings. The total funding required to ensure the airport can continue to operate beyond st March  is a sum of almost poundm per annum. This requirement includes continued operating subsidy , London PSO subvention as well as capital costs to ensure compliance with aviation regulations. googletag.cmd.push Councillors heard how the City of Derry Airport while facing a number of challenges, currently offers customers five key routes across the UK including London, Glasgow and Manchester, Edinburgh and Liverpool providing better connectivity than ever for both businesses and visitors to the region. The Airport, a key employer that positively impacts on local economy through business productivity and tourism and provides an overall estimated annual GVA to the NI economy of pound.m, is working very proactively on route development to build on this foundation and improve links to the North West to open up the gateway to the City and Region. Members of the committee heard in detail about the signicant amount of work done to secure Government support up to the end of March , and how additional Government funding for a minimum six-year period would assist in retaining this connectivity to key destinations in the UK beyond the  March , while essential rail infrastructure investment across the North West is progressed, in particular the A and A. It was outlined to members that the rationale for additional support for the airport would further consolidate the work that has gone into developing the airport and further developing its potential as a vital link within Ireland, the UK and Europe. The move will protect investment in the region, build confidence in our ability to deliver as a centre for business and promote further interest in the North West. Members were told that ultimately the main objective of Council and its strategic partners is the growth and development of the City and Region. The airport has a pivotal role to playcontributing to the delivery of a number of priorities outlined in a series of key relevant government strategies including the draft Programme for Government, Regional Development Strategy, draft Industrial Strategy for Northern Ireland and the ROI National Development Plan . Members were informed how UK Government funding subvention for the PSO route from Derry to London is currently provided at % until March  but will reduce to % thereafter. Council would not have the financial resources to bear this additional cost beyond that point and the full support of Government or Governments for the continued operation of the Airport beyond March  is required. The Council Chief Executiveoutlined to Members the need for Government to work with the Council to provide additional financial support in the form of continued % PSO subvention as well as operational and capital funding support for the Airport post  to ensure its medium term viability in providing continual connectivity to London and other key UK destinations. Members of the committee heard of the current financial challenges being faced by the Airport. Reduced passenger numbers have had a substantial impact on income and changes to flight schedules has resulted in the airport to stay open longer, which has in turn had an impact on the operational costs. Other challenges include - Air Passenger Dutyof pound the single issue affecting growth in the UK and particularly NI Route development, which is directly linked to APD because the heavy tax burden imposed by APD, makes it more attractive for carriers to start up new routes where. The signicant Central Government funding provided to airports in other regions of the UK and Ireland to ensure the sustainability and operation of small regional airports, the current global economic crisis including the lowering of disposable income, high fuel costs and lowering the tendency to fly and the uncertainty around Brexit. It was outlined how European Commission state aid guidelines acknowledge that under current market conditions airports operating under , passengers are experiencing dficulty covering operational costs. Members of the Committee also agreed that Council underwrite an additional sum up to pound, to keep the City of Derry operational to March  as an interim measure to allow the Airport to operate whilst engagement continues with Government. Members were informed that this additional subvention would be allocated from in-year capital savings and therefore have no recurring impact on rates. Members were informed that this additional support will also directly protect up to  jobs at the airport, a further  jobs through indirect and induced employment and a further  jobs through catalytic impacts of business productivity and tourism and provides an overall estimated annual GVA to the NI economy of pound.m and that said despite the challenges, intensive cost saving measures carried out by the Airport Board over the past number of months were not sufficient to mitigate against these pressures and an increased subvention was necessary. Members were also advised that moving beyond , it is hoped that the proposed formal engagement with Central Government in relation to contributions towards ongoing revenue costs would allow Council’s current funding to substantially reduce with associated savings then being available for other key strategic projects identied in the Council’s Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan. It was outlined at the meeting how the Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan -  recognises that highly effective transport infrastructure is vital for the economy and the integral role played by City of Derry Airport in making Derry-Londonderry and the wider North West City Region a more attractive and competitive proposition for inward investors. Its importance in terms of the development and growth of the region’s tourism potential, whilst also delivering economic and social benefits to local communities and the North-West region as a whole, were relayed to members. Members were informed how a key action highlighted within the Strategic Plan is improved connectivity and frequency of flights from City of Derry Airport to major business hubs. The development and sustainability of the Airport and the need for support from government for City of Derry Airport to help the development of new routes, improve connectivity and boost economic growth for the wider city region by increasing access, is also included in the Strategic Growth Plan. The proposals agreed by members are subject to ratication by Full Council later in the month.

We want to bring Tory DUP rule to an end for good. “People Before Profit can be trusted to vote to scrap welfare reform, undo anti-trade union laws, reverse privatisation of public services and resist any attempt to reimpose a hard border here. !Well vote to increase taxes on billionaires. Well vote to stop corporations from polluting the planet. All the establishment parties in the North are complicit in implementing Tory policies through Stormont. They voted to bring in vicious welfare reforms. They voted to cut taxes on corporations. They refused to undo Tory anti-trade union laws. “They have overseen the privatisation of the NHS, the running down of our schools, the destruction of the Housing Executive and disastrous environment policies. They assisted the DUPs effort to block equality for women and LGBT+ community. “Establishment parties here cant be trusted to end Tory rule. They cant be trusted to stand up to corporations and climate polluters. They cant be trusted to stand up for ordinary people. Cllr Harkin concluded: “On December  Vote Shaun Harkin in to get Boris Johnson and the Tories out.” Councillor Harkin contested the constituency at the last General Election in  and polled , votes. His selection brings to three the total of confirmed candidates for the Foyle constituency, joining sitting MP Elisha McCallion and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos

and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars in local musicals with the St Patrickrsquos Choral Society in Downpatrick.Mark has been a constant help and support to his older brother, Declan, and parents John and Brenda after Declan suffered a

Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything.

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it.

vote referendum hold conference looking life post brexit","story":"On Thursday, October , exactly two weeks before the Brexit deadline, Level Three Business students from South West College hosted a non-political student conference where they presented some of the key facts around how student le, and le in general, is likely to be impacted by Brexit.Opening the conference on behalf of her fellow business student colleagues Zanda Rektina said: ldquoSouth West College is the most westerly and one of the most rurally located Colleges of Further and Higher Education in the United Kingdom.ldquoConsidering our location, catchment area in the border region and erse student population, we stand to experience some of the biggest effects from the whole Brexit scenario.During the conference, a number of students led presentations on areas that they believe will be impacted by Brexit including Agriculture and Agri-food, Business and Cross Border Trade, Tourism and Hospitality and Student Le. Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Almost % of the people of South Belfast voted to remain in the EU and it is vital that a pro-Remain MP is ed.“This is a first-past-the-post election and Claire Hanna is best placed to take the South Belfast seat from the incumbent pro-Brexit MP based on previous results.”She added: “Claire Hanna and I have worked well together across a range of issues as South Belfast MLAs and Claire shares my strong pro-Remain credentials.”The development is a blow to Alliance’s Paula Bradshaw because she and Ms Hanna were attempting to persuade voters that they were best placed to defeat the DUP, thus hoping to win tactical votes from the other’s supporters.It is not clear whether the Greens’ announcement is the end of the pacts and quasi-pacts which have unfolded over recent days.The DUP was the first to stand aside, when on Saturday leader Arlene Foster announced that her party would not contest Fermanagh-South Tyrone and instead endorse the UUP’s attempt to take the seat from Sinn Fein.That was followed on Sunday by the incoming UUP Steve Aiken, who just nine days earlier had categorically pledged to stand in all  constituencies, announcing that his party would stand aside in North Belfast in favour of the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds, who is facing a stf challenge from Sinn Fein.Jeffrey Donaldson: The SDLP must clarythe Shankill bomber Sean Kelly is welcome to canvass for them as well as for Sinn Fein Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"On Sunday night the SDLP shocked many observers when it announced that it was standing aside in key constituencies.The party said that it would not run in North Belfast, helping Sinn Fein’s attempt to topple Mr Dodds, as well as in East Belfast and North Down.That was reciprocated on Monday with a statement from Sinn Fein that it would stand aside in South Belfast as well as in East Belfast and North Down.However, some of the strains and potential contradictions in the de facto alliances yesterday began to emerge.The DUP put pressure on the SDLP over the news that Shankill bomber Sean Kelly has been campaigning for Sinn Fein’s John Finucane in North Belfast. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: “Sean Kelly has been canvassing for Sinn Fein in North Belfast but will he now be canvassing on behalf of the SDLP too  “I accept everyone can have a past and can change but Sean Kelly has shown no remorse for murdering nine innocent people, including two children. Do the SDLP endorse his involvement in support of their pact ”However, the SDLP insisted that it had not entered a pact with Sinn Fein, despite standing aside in favour of a Sinn Fein candidate. A spokesman said: “This election is about Remain v Leave but the DUP want it to be a sectarian Green v Orange fight which the SDLP will play no part in. The truth is that it was the DUP’s William McCrea who shared a  with loyalist killer Billy Wright, it was Arlene Foster who was happy to be pictured with Dee Stitt and just last week the DUP leadership was briefing loyalist paramilitaries on Brexit.“Jeffrey Donaldson should clarythe DUP plans to meet loyalist paramilitaries or paramilitary groups in the coming weeks to shore up electoral support and support for their hard Brexit position.

I was shocked by his deliberate isive rhetoric that is stoking anger.Even his own MPs were shocked at his attempt to claim the memory of Jo Cox in support for his demand to leave by October  regardless of the consequences.Describing death threats to MPs as humbug was a new low.Wersquore roughly a month away from potentially crashing out of the EU with no deal on October  and wersquore none the wiser as to how Boris Johnson plans to answer some of the major issues we face.The Prime Minister and his Brexit extremists donrsquot care the damaging impact that a no deal exit would have on our people, on jobs and public services.I have been very clear and consistent about the damage that a no deal Brexit would do.Letrsquos not forget, the people of Cardf South and Penarth voted overwhelmingly to Remain in the  EU Referendum.I will continue to work within my party and across political parties to ensure we arenrsquot dragged out of the EU without a deal against our will.Each day I meet with doctors, nurses, clinicians and patients who are genuinely concerned about the impact of a no deal Brexit on our NHS.Earlier this week I updated the Senedd on how health and social care across Wales are preparing for a no deal Brexit.I agreed to spend poundm of NHS Wales funds to purchase and stockpile essential medical supplies and equipment.To give some context, that poundm could have paid for seven replacement MRI scanners instead.I cannot overstate how much of my time has been taken up on no deal preparation.There is a huge amount of time energy and effort being spent on preparing for the worst possible outcome for our country.That is time energy and effort that should be going into improving health and care services for our staff and the people that they serve.This is not what the people voted for.We have to be honest with ourselves and the public - there is no easy answer to the Brexit farce.That includes my preferred answer of referendum, remain and reform of the EU.The recently announced plan by the Prime Minister to have customs checks in Ireland is a real threat to peace and security.That is not normal.The customs checks that would slow down goods including food and medicines are not normal.The prospect of a Prime Minister breaking the law ndash again ndash at the end of this month to deliver no deal is far from normal.I know any people are tired of Brexit but this is the biggest issue of our generation.Unless we put it back to the people in a referendum then I do not believe we will ever resolve our future within Europe and the UK. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth. APCOA Parking Group has almost  years of industry expertise. With its , employees, the company manages approximately . million inidual parking spaces at more than , locations in  European countries. These include parking spaces at , city and shopping centre locations,  hotels,  hospitals and  European airports.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/WEB2.jpg","title":"danske bank the top team shaping the future","story":"Posted on Tuesday November  by Ulster Business Kevin Kingston, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett speak to John Mulgrew Danske Bank has made a big move in creating two deputy chief executiveroles to help boost business, engagement and further bolster a strong public face for the organisation. Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here.
