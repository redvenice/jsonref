I am disappointed in her actions to say the least,\u0027 wrote Gilbert.\u0027This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we\u0027ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.\u0027\u0027Wow! unreal,\u0027 wrote Barr, who had confessed in earlier interviews to the difficult job Gilbert had of trying to rein in her impulse to tweet offensive comments.However, she later followed up, tweeting: \u0027No, I understand her position and why she said what she said. i forgive her. It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f***ed up.\u0027She reiterated this soon after when a follower criticized Gilbert, saying: \u0027She\u0027s distancing herself from me and my tweet-she has to.\u0027 Gilbert\u0027s on-screen brother did not get off so easy. Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show and started working with Barr when he was just six, was the first to feel the wrath of the show\u0027s creator after he released a statement criticizing her racist tweet saying Jarrett looks like the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027I condemn these statements vehemently,\u0027 wrote Fishman, who is the father of a black daughter in the reboot.\u0027They are reprehensible and intolerable, contradicting my beliefs and outlook on life and society. I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter: \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027  Barr seemed to have made amends with both Gilbert and Fishman after a few days however, writing:  \u0027To michael fishman and sara gilbert: I forgive u both, love u both, just wish u could have called me personally 2 talk rather than do it in a public arena. I understand, tho.

The Queen and Meghan dropped in to see schoolchildren at the Storyhouse building in Chester, but at first the youngsters didn\u0027t seem to notice the visitors had arrived          Getting on famously! The Queen and the Duchess of Sussex shared a joke as they watched a ceremony to open the new Mersey Gateway Bridge during their first official engagement togetherWhat is all the more remarkable is that it should have happened so quickly. Since her wedding on May 19, Meghan has seen the Queen only once – at last Saturday\u0027s Trooping the Colour.While she and Harry have been on honeymoon – said to have been to Canada – the Queen has also been away, to Craigowan Lodge at Balmoral.Royal aides had been thinking about a joint visit involving the monarch and Meghan but it was the Queen herself who suggested it should be sooner rather than later.Meghan\u0027s bond with Her Majesty! Harry\u0027s bride shows her...The Queen\u0027s tribute to Grenfell: Her Majesty observes...Share this articleThe Duchess of Cambridge had been married almost a year before being invited to accompany the Queen, at the start of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 for a day in Leicester.Some will doubtless wonder if this early invitation for Meghan reflects some sort of favouritism. I understand the decision was taken because it was felt the Duchess of Sussex might need more help to adjust to life inside the Royal Family than the already poised Kate Middleton did.   Growing confidence! Meghan seemed completely at ease as she chatted with the monarch          The Duchess of Sussex looked animated as she chatted during her first official engagement with the Queen          It was felt the Duchess of Sussex might need more help to adjust to life inside the Royal Family than the already poised Kate Middleton (left) did\u0027Remember, unlike Kate she doesn\u0027t have a family to fall back on here,\u0027 said an insider.Indeed, it was noticeable how nervous Meghan appeared as she joined the carriage drive last Saturday.\u0027The Queen\u0027s thinking is simple, she wants to put her at her ease,\u0027 says one of her staff.When the invitation arrived, officials assumed Harry would be included too. Instead, it was made clear this was to be a visit for just the two women.Intriguingly, the programme was not especially designed for Meghan – as it was when the Queen took Kate to Leicester where the two sat through a fashion show. In fact it was deliberately planned as a day of typical royal events that would give Meghan a better grounding in the royal routine.\u0027Nothing too starry, lots of handshaking and meeting of local worthies,\u0027 as one insider puts it.    A sudden gust of wind made Meghan’s decision not to wear a hat on her first official engagement with the Queen rather noticeableSo a message was sent to the Queen’s private office asking what the sovereign intended to wear. The answer included mention of the hat by Rachel Trevor Morgan, which some would have taken as a suggestion for Meghan to do the same.But after some discussion, it was agreed between Buckingham and Kensington Palaces that the duchess would let her brunette locks flow free.                        So much has happened to Meghan since her wedding day: Nottingham Cottage where she and Harry live at Kensington Palace has been redecorated and the couple have spent time at their new country bolthole in Oxfordshire.Nevertheless, it is not difficult to imagine how the duchess must have been feeling as she arrived at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening.Whenever the Queen takes the Royal Train there is a protocol to be observed. She dines first at home and then she travels to the station, on this occasion Euston.Meghan, too, had already had supper and the two women were driven together at 10.45pm along with a handful of senior staff. Domestic staff, including footmen, stewards and a dresser, had gone ahead.Once on board the train it is understood the Queen was keen to turn in. She doesn\u0027t like eating late but she did want to ensure that Meghan was comfortable.It must have been an eye-opening experience for the American-born duchess. There are no showers on the train, but full-size baths.   The pair shared a joke during the opening ceremony, showing how a bond is clearly developing between the two women  The Queen looked in great spirits as she began her day out with Harry\u0027s new wife and the pair showed their lighthearted bond as they laughed together during an opening ceremony for the new Mersey Gateway Bridge  The Queen and Meghan were all smiles as they left Chester Town Hall, with both women carrying pretty bouquets of flowers It is thought that Meghan was provided with Prince Philip\u0027s saloon which includes a bedroom, bathroom and sitting room.By the time the train and its royal passengers arrived at Runcorn, Cheshire, yesterday morning after breakfast, Meghan and the Queen had spoken about the day ahead.That much was clear as they exchanged several observations during the ceremony to mark the opening of the Mersey Gateway Bridge.By the time she had watched the Queen unveil two plaques, completed a walkabout, attended a civic lunch and accepted numerous posies, her early stiffness had gone and she began to relax.Next week\u0027s carriage drive at Royal Ascot should be breeze. And next month sees an event where it\u0027s just possible that the Queen will be turning to the newest member of the family for help – the arrival in London of Meghan\u0027s fellow American, US President Donald Trump.

On the way he passed the prime minister, John Major, who patted him on the back and told him he mustn’t blame himself. But, of course, he did.For years he was taunted in the streets — though he hardly did himself any favours by pocketing a reported £50,000 for appearing in a TV ad for Pizza Hut, in which he poked fun at himself and his penalty miss by wearing a paperbag on his head to avoid being recognised. Fast forward 22 years, however, and our hopes once again rest with Southgate.Now 47, he is England’s manager. On Monday evening, when he leads the team into their first World Cup match against Tunisia, his proud parents, Clive and Barbara, will watch with bated breath at their suburban semi in Crawley, West Sussex.When I call at the house, Mr Southgate, a former javelin thrower still spry enough to teach the sport at 81, seems remarkably relaxed, inviting me in for a cup of tea and telling me all about Gareth.Well, he reasons, why should he be nervous? After all, ‘we’ve been through an awful lot together, some really bad times — the missed penalty is the one that keeps coming back’.Everyone forgot that Gareth had volunteered to take a penalty, whereas more experienced internationals ‘didn’t want to know’.Share this articleGareth’s mum Barbara also found herself on the front pages. When the Press visited her, she artlessly recalled how, as a boy, he had promised to ‘belt the ball as hard as he could’ if he was ever called on to take an important penalty. After the match, she had asked him why he hadn’t remembered that, she told reporters.Afterwards, she vowed never to speak publicly about Gareth again — which explained why she had hurried upstairs when I rang the doorbell.For his part, Mr Southgate says he has drawn a veil over the affair, and Gareth has done likewise. ‘I’m sure it won’t affect him at any level now,’ he smiles.Eighteen months ago, when the FA handed him the £3 million-a-year post as England manager there was, as his father readily concedes, ‘an awful lot of flak’.Though Mr Southgate does not use Facebook or Twitter, he did take a look at the ‘appalling’ comments about his son’s appointment on social media. He switched off his computer in disgust.Critics said Gareth lacked experience (the only club he had managed was Middlesbrough, who sacked him after three years after being relegated) and pointed to his unconvincing record as manager of England’s under-21 team.With his studious demeanour and affable nature, he was also regarded as a tame Establishment ‘yes’ man.As he wrote in a biographical book: ‘I have never been good at gambling, drinking, fighting, tantrums, celebrity.’‘Nice guy, that Southgate, but boring,’ people would say of him.The truth is very different. Not only is his understated managerial style utterly refreshing, it promises — dare we say it — to restore England’s pride.But then, from the age of 16, when he began an apprenticeship with Crystal Palace, and was ribbed by fellow trainees for his plummy accent, impeccable manners and unfashionable clothes (not to mention his eight good O-levels), Southgate has always been the antithesis of the modern footballer.          Clive Southgate, invited to describe his son’s managerial strengths, says Gareth’s natural eagerness to learn has led him to draw on many sources for coaching ideas, from baseball and rugby to cricket In his book, Southgate recalls how he and Alison would meet in a Tesco car park to keep their romance secret from her ex. However, when he was transferred to Aston Villa, she gave him an ultimatum: either she moved to Birmingham with him or the relationship must end.His parents, he writes, were ‘a little taken aback’ when they announced they were living together because they had only met her once, and ‘found it hard to believe that a son who had been so methodical, logical and weighed up everything’ would behave so capriciously.They married in June 1997, in a low-key ceremony at his parents’ local church. They now have two children, Mia, 19, a university student, and Flynn, 15, a boarder at a private school in Yorkshire, who excels at cricket.The family home is Swinsty Hall, a magnificent Grade I-listed Elizabethan manor nestled in the wilds of North Yorkshire, that he bought for £3.75 million when he moved to Middlesbrough.The pile is so remote that ferrying the children to school became a chore, and they tried to sell it. But there were no takers — even when they slashed the price by £500,000 — so they appear marooned. Since the FA’s national football centre is 100 miles away, in Burton upon Trent, it means Southgate spends weeknights in a hotel.Meanwhile, his 51-year-old wife busies herself with yoga classes, gym workouts, and coffee mornings in nearby Harrogate. She guards the family’s privacy fiercely but, according to her father-in-law, she and the children will attend at least one match in Russia.Southgate’s business affairs are something of a mystery. Company records show that between 1996 and 2016, he was a director of Gareth Southgate Promotions Ltd, which five years ago was worth about £1 million. He has also had interests in other companies.There is, though, one financial worry hanging over Southgate. He is among dozens of wealthy sportsmen and celebrities who ploughed a total of £620 million into Ingenious, a film production company. It is accused by HMRC of helping investors avoid tax by writing off losses on unprofitable movies against other parts of their income.Southgate has assured the FA that he will abide by any legal ruling on the matter, and that he has always paid his taxes.But back to the World Cup. Clive Southgate, invited to describe his son’s managerial strengths, says Gareth’s natural eagerness to learn has led him to draw on many sources for coaching ideas, from baseball and rugby to cricket.Then there is his inclusiveness. His son treats everyone equally, from the lowliest member of ground staff to the biggest star.When he last spoke to Gareth, in a phone call shortly before the England squad flew to Russia, his son told him they couldn’t have done more to prepare, and were ‘ready’ for the fray.That said, Southgate Sr holds no hope of England winning the World Cup.‘No, no, no, no,’ he says, when I raise the possibility. ‘I don’t think we’ve got enough world-class players. It would be successful for England to get through the group. After that it’s probably going to be Germany or Brazil.‘But then, in cup games almost anything can happen. There are so many young players there that, if they don’t get over-awed, they could provide a little shock.’His son, he says, is ‘under no illusions that it will end up in the sack’ should he fail to turn England from perennial losers to champions, if not in Russia then within the next few years.‘He could deal with that, but his biggest concern is for his coaching team. If he loses his job, then they are also out of a job. He had a higher level playing career than them, so financially they wouldn’t be as well off as he was when they finished playing. They’ve uprooted their families and moved up the country to be with him, and he would feel he had let them down.’How typical of Southgate to put the welfare of his staff ahead of his own. We can only wish this admirable English gentleman good luck in the coming days and weeks — and pray none of his players ends up wearing a paperbag on their head in a pizza commercial. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/15/00/01FEB8E5000004B0-0-image-m-32_1529017731406.jpg","title":"Royal familys gay wedding story Queens cousin Lord Ivar Mountbatten","story":"    Lord Ivar Mountbatten (right) with his fiancee James Coyle and former wife lady Penny Mountbatten at their home in Uffculme in DevonFor the sake of their daughters, Ella, 22, Alix, 20, and 15-year-old Luli, Lord Ivar, Penny and James, who now considers the girls to be his children, too, want the announcement to be handled with dignity.

You and I have got on from the first ten seconds of meeting each other, haven\u0027t we?\u0027 she says to James, the man who is due to become her former husband\u0027s husband.\u0027What I don\u0027t think Ivar realises is how much he has changed as a man since he \u0027came out\u0027. James is hugely responsible for that because he\u0027s so much fun.\u0027Ivar is so much more relaxed these days. He\u0027s so much kinder. He\u0027s become a great cook. I now call him Fanny Cradock. He probably wasn\u0027t even aware that by keeping his sexuality a secret it was really quite tormenting him. Now it\u0027s \u0027out\u0027 he\u0027s a completely different person. Everybody says they\u0027ve never seen him happier.\u0027          The former couple pose with their three daughters at a polo match in West Sussex in 2005 This impending marriage, indeed, has the full blessing of their extended family and those closest to them, including Lord Ivar\u0027s lifelong friend Prince Edward, to whose eldest child he is a godparent. The Earl and Countess of Wessex are also godparents to his two eldest daughters.\u0027Sophie and Edward know of our plans and are really excited for us,\u0027 says Lord Ivar. \u0027Sadly they can\u0027t come to the wedding. Their diaries are arranged months in advance and they\u0027re not around, but they adore James. Everyone adores him.\u0027All my good friends have accepted James. I basically told everyone: \u0027I\u0027ve found somebody — it\u0027s a bloke.\u0027 They just started laughing. Then they met James and one particular mate said: \u0027If I was gay, I\u0027d certainly go for him.\u0027 He lowers his voice conspiratorially as Penny and James disappear together to sort out lunch.\u0027Now they\u0027re both out of the room, I can say they are both so similar. James hates it when I say that, but, oh God, they\u0027re so caring and so giving.          Aristocratic ideal: Lord Ivar Mountbatten and Penny on their wedding day 24 years ago\u0027Growing up in Glasgow was challenging for James. He once overheard his father, who was a strict Catholic, calling him \u0027the queer one\u0027. He wondered who he was referring to.\u0027James was once dangled by his ankles from a bridge, 40ft over the River Kelvin, by a bunch of thugs. When one of the thugs said, \u0027Let him go,\u0027 he assumed they were going to allow him to escape. They were actually going to drop him in the river. He\u0027s so sweet. He just thinks the best of everybody.\u0027He replaces the photograph of his earlier wedding, attended by Princess Margaret and Prince Edward, on the side. \u0027I loved Penny when we were married, as I still do very much, and I loved our family unit,\u0027 he says. \u0027I never thought this would happen. It\u0027s brilliant, but I never thought I\u0027d marry a man.\u0027When I mentioned it to our eldest daughter, Ella, she said, \u0027Oh Pap, it\u0027s not a big deal. It\u0027s so normal nowadays\u0027. Of course that generation, they\u0027re completely cool about the concept of this — maybe not so cool about their own father, which is completely understandable.\u0027 He sits forward on the sofa.\u0027Being completely truthful, it doesn\u0027t sit comfortably with me that I\u0027m going out with a man,\u0027 he confides. \u0027I\u0027ve lived my whole life as a heterosexual. So, all of a sudden, having a bloke around is unusual — even now. It\u0027s brilliant but I suppose in an ideal world I would prefer to have a wife because that has always been the norm.We were talking with friends in Bermuda about this nature-nurture business not so long ago.

When they intensified a week later, her mother Alison noticed the pregnancy bump was moving and took her to hospital where doctors confirmed she was in labour.Amelia arrived – still in the amniotic sac – weighing 1lb 5oz, and Gethin followed shortly after at 1lb 6oz.They were taken to neonatal intensive care at Maelor Hospital, Wrexham, where teachers Miss Williams, 27, and Mr Jones, 32, kept a bedside vigil.The babies were wrapped in special plastic to keep them warm and hooked up to ventilators in incubators, which is when their parents saw them properly for the first time.‘It all moved so quickly,’ said Miss Williams. ‘Within minutes I was surrounded by 15 to 20 doctors and nurses. I was trying to be brave. I knew I had to be as calm as possible to give them the best chance of survival.’          Amelia holds her father’s finger: She was resuscitated after her heart rate fell. They were taken to neonatal intensive care where teachers Miss Williams and Mr Jones kept a bedside vigil          Gethin in intensive care: He had a bleed on the brain and a collapsed lung. The couple said they were surrounded by parents whose babies were sadly losing their fight, and having to console them, tooThe babies were moved to Arrowe Park Hospital on Wirral, Merseyside, to receive more specialist care. The newborns fought off sepsis and Amelia needed resuscitating when a heart valve that was not closing properly caused her heart rate to plummet. She later had laser eye surgery to save her sight.Gethin had a serious bleed on the brain and a collapsed lung. But both babies astonished doctors with their recoveries.Their parents were able to stay nearby thanks to the Ronald McDonald House Charities, which provides free accommodation for families with children in hospital.          Their mother Carly Williams with husband Gareth and the twins. The pair are nearly 3 and start nursery in SeptemberAbortion is legal in the UK before 24 weeks. Studies have shown that around half of babies born at 24 weeks are now surviving thanks to medical advances, although it can often result in disability.Mr Jones said: ‘Carly and I had to be so strong, mentally. We’d get calls in the middle of the night saying something else had happened, and urging us to get down to the ward. The sound of that phone still stays with me. It was so piercing, and we knew it was always bringing bad news.‘We were also surrounded by parents whose babies were sadly losing their fight, and having to console them, too. It was the hardest thing we’ll ever have to do.’ Now Amelia and Gethin share a special bond – playing, climbing and learning to speak English and Welsh together. They are due to start nursery in September.Miss Williams said: ‘Only now we’re out the other side of it do we realise how flabbergasting it is that the twins have escaped with very few issues. Nobody knows what drove them to survive – whether it was medicine, science, or just having Gareth and I there, willing them on.‘Everyone is amazed by their progress. They are so incredibly resilient. We’re in absolute awe of them both.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/16/01/4D486B9000000578-5850053-image-a-7_1529110530100.jpg","title":"Undercover worlds elitist secret society","story":"    An entrance to NH Lingotto hotel where the secretive Bilderberg conference was held. The large bubble meeting room can be seen in the distance over the roof of the building          Police vans and officers wait outside entrance to NH Lingotto hotel in Turin while the summit took place          Another large police van stationed near the premises of where the Bilderberg conference was held          Bubble rooftop meeting room and helipad designed by Renzo Piano – it is unknown if there were any meetings held here          A freelance journalist, who posted footage online of the empty garden marquee where the Bilderberg banquet was due to be held, reported that Italian police stormed his hotel room at 4.30am breaking down his door and ‘pointing a gun’ at himIt is vital that I take this labyrinthine route in and out of the hotel for the next five days, I’m told, as there is a ‘top secret event’ taking place. ‘The whole hotel is closed to the public,’ says my boss. ‘It’s very important you remember you cannot go in and out of the main entrance. You must use the secret one.’Although I feign meek subservience, I know very well why levels of security have been ramped up to such histrionic levels at this unassuming four-star hotel in northern Italy, because I am here undercover. My mission is to covertly observe the most secretive gathering of the influential and powerful in the world, known as the Bilderberg Group.This cabal of the global, largely liberal, elite — with strong ties to the EU — meets every year amid a cloak of secrecy.At this year’s gathering? With so-called ‘populism’ high on its agenda, passionate Remainers, including former Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and former Chancellor George Osborne, all took time out of their busy schedules to attend.Over drinks receptions and lavish meals, they rubbed shoulders with former president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, three serving EU prime ministers and a current European Commissioner in charge of the bloc’s budget.Last weekend, the Mail became the first newspaper in the 64-year history of Bilderberg to penetrate its formidable security, gaining insight into the extreme paranoia of this most elusive of clubs.I watched as military police guarded the hotel perimeter and sniffer dogs checked for bombs outside. Last week, one freelance journalist, who posted footage online of the empty garden marquee where the Bilderberg banquet was due to be held, reported that Italian police stormed his hotel room at 4.30am breaking down his door and ‘pointing a gun’ at him.          The only entrance to the hotel where the Bilderberg conference was held is on the left past the car. Opposite and surrounded by fences is the police building          Armed police present at the Turin airport, near to where the Bilberberg conference was held this yearSo clandestine are the Bilderberg gatherings that no minutes are taken, no press conferences given and no reports published.The conference operates under ‘Chatham House Rules’, which means participants can use and report information exchanged there, but not disclose the source. But with no record of what goes on — Bilderberg was held on exactly the same weekends as G7 and NATO defence meetings, allowing opportunities for conference calls — critics have said it should be much more transparent. Many argue that the event exists solely to serve as a networking and lobbying opportunity for its attendees.The Bilderberg Group — so called because it first met in 1954 at the Hotel Bilderberg in the Netherlands — is made up of at least 120 self-proclaimed ‘leading citizens’ of Europe and the U.S., who meet annually to discuss ‘issues of common interest’.Every summer, figureheads from politics, business, academia, finance and defence lock themselves away in a closely guarded hotel for three days to discuss topics of vital global significance about which the rest of us can only speculate.Hypothesis and conjecture about the content of their talks inevitably abound. At one extreme there are conspiracy theorists who believe that the hounding from office of Margaret Thatcher, the downfall of U.S. President Richard Nixon and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy were all secretly orchestrated by the Bilderberg Group.    Corridors of the hotel. It has three floors in two parallel buildings joined by a walkway in the middle          The only entrance by vehicle to the hotel is  on the right, obscured by the bus stop. The police building is just to the right          A bomb-sniffing dog spotted on the perimeter of the hotel where the Bilderberg conference was heldUnlike previous Bilderberg meetings, which have been held high up in the Alps or in remote chateaux, this year’s conference is, audaciously, hidden in plain sight.The NH Lingotto shares space with a run-down shopping centre — the location of that secret staff entrance — itself surrounded by 10ft concrete walls, and the main hotel entrance is accessible only through a police check point. Inside, as guards swarm the lobby and staff are kitted out with walkie-talkies, I’m frequently left to my own devices. Nevertheless, the NH Hotel Group said it ‘takes the security of its guests very seriously’.I wander around, exploring the store rooms, staff areas and the main switchboard for the entire hotel, surveying wires and buttons from floor to ceiling.In spite of ferocious security efforts, if I was someone with nefarious intentions I could have done something pretty terrible by now.On my first day, I’m given a staff master-key with access to all 240 guest rooms.As I work methodically through each, supplying it with mineral water and a fruit bowl ready for the arrival of its VIP inhabitant, I wonder — could I be preparing this for Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands? Or perhaps Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary? Or even for American statesman Henry Kissinger? On Thursday afternoon at the hotel, minutes before the first delegates arrive, the tension in the foyer is palpable.Outside, I survey the dozens of suited security and hotel staff, many with ear pieces, some virtually bouncing on the soles of their shoes. No one speaks. They all just wait in position.Many of the VIPs arrive in private jets at Turin private airport, from where they are driven with police escorts — blue lights flashing, but no sirens — to the hotel.A flurry of hotel staff greet the disembarking VIPs, while more staff with hotel-branded umbrellas shield them from the lashing rain.A polite American man approaches me. ‘Excuse me, where’s the bar around here?’ he asks. I clock his name badge: David Petraeus, former director of the CIA and commander of the United States Central Command, as I ask him what he’d like to drink.‘Which red wines do you have?’ he asks, at which point I remember I’m not actually bar trained I’ve no idea where the wine was even kept, let alone which vintage to recommend. I have to summon help.Then a room service errand takes me up to an Italian delegate’s room. He has ordered five bottles of mineral water and one glass to use for each bottle. As soon as the door is halfway open, he barks: ‘Still, I ordered still! Not sparkling!’ I’m relieved I have a colleague with me who assures him: ‘But this is still, sir.’  Architect design drawings of the Renzo Piano-designed bubble rooftop atop the Lingotto factory building adorn the walls of the hotel interior  Four of the yellow cards given to guests, where they talked about \u0027populism in Europe\u0027, \u0027Whither free trade\u0027 and other subjects. In each ‘evaluation form’, the delegates must rate each talk on a scale of one to five on factors including ‘importance topic’, ‘quality panellist’, ‘interaction’ and so onI arrive back downstairs to see a much-diminished Henry Kissinger being escorted in a wheelchair across the marbled floor by two suited men.At 95, Mr Kissinger, former U.S. Secretary of State, is one of Bilderberg’s oldest and most regular delegates. The alleged war criminal has been attending intermittently since 1957.Demis Hassabis, the British computer game designer behind Google’s DeepMind, then asks me for directions to the ‘dinner’. Improvising, I direct him vaguely down the corridor.A jovial man in glasses also approaches me to ask where ‘the conference’ is. It is Jose Manuel Barroso, former president of the European Commission, now chairman of Goldman Sachs International. He is surrounded by four people all clamouring to talk to him, and he looks like the cat that got the cream.All attendees are also given yellow paper ‘score cards’ on which they must give TripAdvisor-style self-evaluation assessments of talks. On each form delegates must rate discussions on a scale of one to five including ‘importance of topic’, ‘quality of panellist’, ‘interaction’ and so on.The discussions include such subjects as: ‘Populism In Europe’, ‘The U.S. Before Mid-Terms’ (in other words, Donald Trump) ‘The Future Of Work’, ‘Jobs, Skills, Wages’ and ‘Whither Free Trade?’ — plus the more ambiguous ‘Where Are We?’      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/15/13/4D43CD4A00000578-0-image-a-8_1529064545021.jpg","title":"Albanian sneaked UK lorry tracked resort bolthole","story":"    Elidon Habilaj (pictured) claimed to be fleeing torture in war-torn KosovoAfter sneaking into Dover illegally on a lorry, Elidon Habilaj claimed to be fleeing torture in war-torn Kosovo.In truth, he had come from Albania – but he was able to claim asylum by using a fake name.Having hoodwinked the authorities and won the right to stay, he might have kept a low profile. Instead, he conned his way into a job with the \u0027British FBI\u0027 hunting fugitives – only to go on the run himself when he was finally found out.The 40-year-old was jailed for 18 months in his absence after gaining UK citizenship by lying to officials.Now the Mail has tracked down the former Scotland Yard and Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) intelligence officer to his bolthole in the seaside resort of Vlore in his homeland.He has spent six years there hiding from the UK authorities he once worked for – even boasting of his experience with the British police to gain security work in Albania. Ironically, Soca – now part of the National Crime Agency, nicknamed the British FBI – had been investigating Habilaj without realising he was one of its employees.The Albanian arrived in Britain in 1998, and claimed he was a Kosovan named Bekim Ademi. He said his brother had been tortured to death and his father killed by the Kosovan Liberation Army.It\u0027s time to set up migrant processing centres in AFRICA,...Radicalised asylum seekers have murdered or injured more...Share this articleBritish authorities believed him, and he was granted full asylum in November 2001, and citizenship five years later.He was hired by the Metropolitan Police and later Soca, where he worked as an intelligence officer in its London-based \u0027fugitive location team\u0027, helping to find suspected criminals wanted for extradition. He was finally unmasked after checking his own file on a work database of people of interest. Habilaj even called up a photo of himself on his computer screen in front of his boss.Belated checks revealed that he had been born in Albania rather than Kosovo, he never had a brother, and his father was alive and still living in his home town. After he absconded before his trial, Judge Martyn Zeidman QC issued a bench warrant, which instructs police to arrest Habilaj if he is traced. The warrants remain live and legally in force until the suspect is caught or voluntarily returns to face justice.          Habilaj has spent six years there hiding from the UK authorities he once worked forHabilaj was subsequently tried in his absence and jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court in January 2013 after being convicted of obtaining leave to enter or remain in the UK by deception and fraud.The sentencing judge Simon Wilkinson said: \u0027He pretended to be a Kosovan and he was an Albanian who made up tales of atrocities to evoke sympathy.\u0027But he has successfully evaded British authorities, and this week we found him overseeing building work on a hotel he manages on the outskirts of Vlore.He also touts himself as a \u0027freelance security consultant\u0027 and boasts to locals of his time working for the British police – without revealing how his time in the UK came to an abrupt end.When approached by the Mail, Habilaj angrily demanded: \u0027Who has sent you? Who was it who brought you here?\u0027 He then ordered one of his building workers to chase us off the premises.Now a father of one, Habilaj boasts online that he has a degree and master\u0027s in criminology, and also claims to have written books on the subject.In a post written in Albanian and posted on Facebook in 2015, he described how he worked for the \u0027highest British agency against crime for almost two years.\u0027He added: \u0027Before that, I did work for the Metropolitan Police in London at its prestigious centre of Scotland Yard. It is an organisation dedicated to perfection and professionalism. I was one of them capable of doing the job, recruited for my academic achievements in the field of criminology.\u0027A spokesman for the National Crime Agency said: \u0027We continue to work with the Home Office in relation to this case.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/16/01/4D4617DA00000578-5850483-1916-a-122_1529109894608.jpg","title":"Maps New York shows stunning evolution","story":"    A map describing the town of Mannados, or New Amsterdam, as it was in September 1661.

I didn\u0027t talk to him this week but all I know was he was so happy last week. I mean giddy,\u0027 she said.\u0027He was texting me and emailing me which he doesn\u0027t normally do about publicity for episodes but he was like, \u0027This is a high water mark, this is the best thing I\u0027ve ever done.\u0027 He was so excited to be working with Christopher Doyle. I saw nothing that would indicate what happened. Like, why this would happen?\u0027We\u0027re just floored.

On the way he passed the prime minister, John Major, who patted him on the back and told him he mustn’t blame himself. But, of course, he did.For years he was taunted in the streets — though he hardly did himself any favours by pocketing a reported £50,000 for appearing in a TV ad for Pizza Hut, in which he poked fun at himself and his penalty miss by wearing a paperbag on his head to avoid being recognised. Fast forward 22 years, however, and our hopes once again rest with Southgate.Now 47, he is England’s manager. On Monday evening, when he leads the team into their first World Cup match against Tunisia, his proud parents, Clive and Barbara, will watch with bated breath at their suburban semi in Crawley, West Sussex.When I call at the house, Mr Southgate, a former javelin thrower still spry enough to teach the sport at 81, seems remarkably relaxed, inviting me in for a cup of tea and telling me all about Gareth.Well, he reasons, why should he be nervous? After all, ‘we’ve been through an awful lot together, some really bad times — the missed penalty is the one that keeps coming back’.Everyone forgot that Gareth had volunteered to take a penalty, whereas more experienced internationals ‘didn’t want to know’.Share this articleGareth’s mum Barbara also found herself on the front pages. When the Press visited her, she artlessly recalled how, as a boy, he had promised to ‘belt the ball as hard as he could’ if he was ever called on to take an important penalty. After the match, she had asked him why he hadn’t remembered that, she told reporters.Afterwards, she vowed never to speak publicly about Gareth again — which explained why she had hurried upstairs when I rang the doorbell.For his part, Mr Southgate says he has drawn a veil over the affair, and Gareth has done likewise. ‘I’m sure it won’t affect him at any level now,’ he smiles.Eighteen months ago, when the FA handed him the £3 million-a-year post as England manager there was, as his father readily concedes, ‘an awful lot of flak’.Though Mr Southgate does not use Facebook or Twitter, he did take a look at the ‘appalling’ comments about his son’s appointment on social media. He switched off his computer in disgust.Critics said Gareth lacked experience (the only club he had managed was Middlesbrough, who sacked him after three years after being relegated) and pointed to his unconvincing record as manager of England’s under-21 team.With his studious demeanour and affable nature, he was also regarded as a tame Establishment ‘yes’ man.As he wrote in a biographical book: ‘I have never been good at gambling, drinking, fighting, tantrums, celebrity.’‘Nice guy, that Southgate, but boring,’ people would say of him.The truth is very different. Not only is his understated managerial style utterly refreshing, it promises — dare we say it — to restore England’s pride.But then, from the age of 16, when he began an apprenticeship with Crystal Palace, and was ribbed by fellow trainees for his plummy accent, impeccable manners and unfashionable clothes (not to mention his eight good O-levels), Southgate has always been the antithesis of the modern footballer.          Clive Southgate, invited to describe his son’s managerial strengths, says Gareth’s natural eagerness to learn has led him to draw on many sources for coaching ideas, from baseball and rugby to cricket In his book, Southgate recalls how he and Alison would meet in a Tesco car park to keep their romance secret from her ex. However, when he was transferred to Aston Villa, she gave him an ultimatum: either she moved to Birmingham with him or the relationship must end.His parents, he writes, were ‘a little taken aback’ when they announced they were living together because they had only met her once, and ‘found it hard to believe that a son who had been so methodical, logical and weighed up everything’ would behave so capriciously.They married in June 1997, in a low-key ceremony at his parents’ local church. They now have two children, Mia, 19, a university student, and Flynn, 15, a boarder at a private school in Yorkshire, who excels at cricket.The family home is Swinsty Hall, a magnificent Grade I-listed Elizabethan manor nestled in the wilds of North Yorkshire, that he bought for £3.75 million when he moved to Middlesbrough.The pile is so remote that ferrying the children to school became a chore, and they tried to sell it. But there were no takers — even when they slashed the price by £500,000 — so they appear marooned. Since the FA’s national football centre is 100 miles away, in Burton upon Trent, it means Southgate spends weeknights in a hotel.Meanwhile, his 51-year-old wife busies herself with yoga classes, gym workouts, and coffee mornings in nearby Harrogate. She guards the family’s privacy fiercely but, according to her father-in-law, she and the children will attend at least one match in Russia.Southgate’s business affairs are something of a mystery. Company records show that between 1996 and 2016, he was a director of Gareth Southgate Promotions Ltd, which five years ago was worth about £1 million. He has also had interests in other companies.There is, though, one financial worry hanging over Southgate. He is among dozens of wealthy sportsmen and celebrities who ploughed a total of £620 million into Ingenious, a film production company. It is accused by HMRC of helping investors avoid tax by writing off losses on unprofitable movies against other parts of their income.Southgate has assured the FA that he will abide by any legal ruling on the matter, and that he has always paid his taxes.But back to the World Cup. Clive Southgate, invited to describe his son’s managerial strengths, says Gareth’s natural eagerness to learn has led him to draw on many sources for coaching ideas, from baseball and rugby to cricket.Then there is his inclusiveness. His son treats everyone equally, from the lowliest member of ground staff to the biggest star.When he last spoke to Gareth, in a phone call shortly before the England squad flew to Russia, his son told him they couldn’t have done more to prepare, and were ‘ready’ for the fray.That said, Southgate Sr holds no hope of England winning the World Cup.‘No, no, no, no,’ he says, when I raise the possibility. ‘I don’t think we’ve got enough world-class players. It would be successful for England to get through the group. After that it’s probably going to be Germany or Brazil.‘But then, in cup games almost anything can happen. There are so many young players there that, if they don’t get over-awed, they could provide a little shock.’His son, he says, is ‘under no illusions that it will end up in the sack’ should he fail to turn England from perennial losers to champions, if not in Russia then within the next few years.‘He could deal with that, but his biggest concern is for his coaching team. If he loses his job, then they are also out of a job. He had a higher level playing career than them, so financially they wouldn’t be as well off as he was when they finished playing. They’ve uprooted their families and moved up the country to be with him, and he would feel he had let them down.’How typical of Southgate to put the welfare of his staff ahead of his own. We can only wish this admirable English gentleman good luck in the coming days and weeks — and pray none of his players ends up wearing a paperbag on their head in a pizza commercial. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/15/21/4D48638D00000578-5849991-image-a-12_1529096380845.jpg","title":"Little wonders Toddler twins born 24 weeks","story":"    Full of life: Twins Amelia and Gethin will be three next monthThe couple, from Wrexham, had initially dismissed back pains Miss Williams had been experiencing as part of the pregnancy. When they intensified a week later, her mother Alison noticed the pregnancy bump was moving and took her to hospital where doctors confirmed she was in labour.Amelia arrived – still in the amniotic sac – weighing 1lb 5oz, and Gethin followed shortly after at 1lb 6oz.They were taken to neonatal intensive care at Maelor Hospital, Wrexham, where teachers Miss Williams, 27, and Mr Jones, 32, kept a bedside vigil.The babies were wrapped in special plastic to keep them warm and hooked up to ventilators in incubators, which is when their parents saw them properly for the first time.‘It all moved so quickly,’ said Miss Williams. ‘Within minutes I was surrounded by 15 to 20 doctors and nurses. I was trying to be brave. I knew I had to be as calm as possible to give them the best chance of survival.’          Amelia holds her father’s finger: She was resuscitated after her heart rate fell. They were taken to neonatal intensive care where teachers Miss Williams and Mr Jones kept a bedside vigil          Gethin in intensive care: He had a bleed on the brain and a collapsed lung. The couple said they were surrounded by parents whose babies were sadly losing their fight, and having to console them, tooThe babies were moved to Arrowe Park Hospital on Wirral, Merseyside, to receive more specialist care. The newborns fought off sepsis and Amelia needed resuscitating when a heart valve that was not closing properly caused her heart rate to plummet. She later had laser eye surgery to save her sight.Gethin had a serious bleed on the brain and a collapsed lung. But both babies astonished doctors with their recoveries.Their parents were able to stay nearby thanks to the Ronald McDonald House Charities, which provides free accommodation for families with children in hospital.

Studies have shown that around half of babies born at 24 weeks are now surviving thanks to medical advances, although it can often result in disability.Mr Jones said: ‘Carly and I had to be so strong, mentally. We’d get calls in the middle of the night saying something else had happened, and urging us to get down to the ward. The sound of that phone still stays with me. It was so piercing, and we knew it was always bringing bad news.‘We were also surrounded by parents whose babies were sadly losing their fight, and having to console them, too. It was the hardest thing we’ll ever have to do.’ Now Amelia and Gethin share a special bond – playing, climbing and learning to speak English and Welsh together. They are due to start nursery in September.Miss Williams said: ‘Only now we’re out the other side of it do we realise how flabbergasting it is that the twins have escaped with very few issues. Nobody knows what drove them to survive – whether it was medicine, science, or just having Gareth and I there, willing them on.‘Everyone is amazed by their progress. They are so incredibly resilient. We’re in absolute awe of them both.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/16/01/4D486B9000000578-5850053-image-a-7_1529110530100.jpg","title":"Undercover worlds elitist secret society","story":"    An entrance to NH Lingotto hotel where the secretive Bilderberg conference was held.

You must use the secret one.’Although I feign meek subservience, I know very well why levels of security have been ramped up to such histrionic levels at this unassuming four-star hotel in northern Italy, because I am here undercover. My mission is to covertly observe the most secretive gathering of the influential and powerful in the world, known as the Bilderberg Group.This cabal of the global, largely liberal, elite — with strong ties to the EU — meets every year amid a cloak of secrecy.At this year’s gathering? With so-called ‘populism’ high on its agenda, passionate Remainers, including former Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and former Chancellor George Osborne, all took time out of their busy schedules to attend.Over drinks receptions and lavish meals, they rubbed shoulders with former president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, three serving EU prime ministers and a current European Commissioner in charge of the bloc’s budget.Last weekend, the Mail became the first newspaper in the 64-year history of Bilderberg to penetrate its formidable security, gaining insight into the extreme paranoia of this most elusive of clubs.I watched as military police guarded the hotel perimeter and sniffer dogs checked for bombs outside. Last week, one freelance journalist, who posted footage online of the empty garden marquee where the Bilderberg banquet was due to be held, reported that Italian police stormed his hotel room at 4.30am breaking down his door and ‘pointing a gun’ at him.          The only entrance to the hotel where the Bilderberg conference was held is on the left past the car. Opposite and surrounded by fences is the police building          Armed police present at the Turin airport, near to where the Bilberberg conference was held this yearSo clandestine are the Bilderberg gatherings that no minutes are taken, no press conferences given and no reports published.The conference operates under ‘Chatham House Rules’, which means participants can use and report information exchanged there, but not disclose the source. But with no record of what goes on — Bilderberg was held on exactly the same weekends as G7 and NATO defence meetings, allowing opportunities for conference calls — critics have said it should be much more transparent. Many argue that the event exists solely to serve as a networking and lobbying opportunity for its attendees.The Bilderberg Group — so called because it first met in 1954 at the Hotel Bilderberg in the Netherlands — is made up of at least 120 self-proclaimed ‘leading citizens’ of Europe and the U.S., who meet annually to discuss ‘issues of common interest’.Every summer, figureheads from politics, business, academia, finance and defence lock themselves away in a closely guarded hotel for three days to discuss topics of vital global significance about which the rest of us can only speculate.Hypothesis and conjecture about the content of their talks inevitably abound. At one extreme there are conspiracy theorists who believe that the hounding from office of Margaret Thatcher, the downfall of U.S. President Richard Nixon and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy were all secretly orchestrated by the Bilderberg Group.    Corridors of the hotel. It has three floors in two parallel buildings joined by a walkway in the middle          The only entrance by vehicle to the hotel is  on the right, obscured by the bus stop. The police building is just to the right          A bomb-sniffing dog spotted on the perimeter of the hotel where the Bilderberg conference was heldUnlike previous Bilderberg meetings, which have been held high up in the Alps or in remote chateaux, this year’s conference is, audaciously, hidden in plain sight.The NH Lingotto shares space with a run-down shopping centre — the location of that secret staff entrance — itself surrounded by 10ft concrete walls, and the main hotel entrance is accessible only through a police check point. Inside, as guards swarm the lobby and staff are kitted out with walkie-talkies, I’m frequently left to my own devices. Nevertheless, the NH Hotel Group said it ‘takes the security of its guests very seriously’.I wander around, exploring the store rooms, staff areas and the main switchboard for the entire hotel, surveying wires and buttons from floor to ceiling.In spite of ferocious security efforts, if I was someone with nefarious intentions I could have done something pretty terrible by now.On my first day, I’m given a staff master-key with access to all 240 guest rooms.As I work methodically through each, supplying it with mineral water and a fruit bowl ready for the arrival of its VIP inhabitant, I wonder — could I be preparing this for Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands? Or perhaps Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary? Or even for American statesman Henry Kissinger? On Thursday afternoon at the hotel, minutes before the first delegates arrive, the tension in the foyer is palpable.Outside, I survey the dozens of suited security and hotel staff, many with ear pieces, some virtually bouncing on the soles of their shoes. No one speaks. They all just wait in position.Many of the VIPs arrive in private jets at Turin private airport, from where they are driven with police escorts — blue lights flashing, but no sirens — to the hotel.A flurry of hotel staff greet the disembarking VIPs, while more staff with hotel-branded umbrellas shield them from the lashing rain.A polite American man approaches me. ‘Excuse me, where’s the bar around here?’ he asks. I clock his name badge: David Petraeus, former director of the CIA and commander of the United States Central Command, as I ask him what he’d like to drink.‘Which red wines do you have?’ he asks, at which point I remember I’m not actually bar trained I’ve no idea where the wine was even kept, let alone which vintage to recommend. I have to summon help.Then a room service errand takes me up to an Italian delegate’s room. He has ordered five bottles of mineral water and one glass to use for each bottle. As soon as the door is halfway open, he barks: ‘Still, I ordered still! Not sparkling!’ I’m relieved I have a colleague with me who assures him: ‘But this is still, sir.’  Architect design drawings of the Renzo Piano-designed bubble rooftop atop the Lingotto factory building adorn the walls of the hotel interior  Four of the yellow cards given to guests, where they talked about \u0027populism in Europe\u0027, \u0027Whither free trade\u0027 and other subjects. In each ‘evaluation form’, the delegates must rate each talk on a scale of one to five on factors including ‘importance topic’, ‘quality panellist’, ‘interaction’ and so onI arrive back downstairs to see a much-diminished Henry Kissinger being escorted in a wheelchair across the marbled floor by two suited men.At 95, Mr Kissinger, former U.S. Secretary of State, is one of Bilderberg’s oldest and most regular delegates. The alleged war criminal has been attending intermittently since 1957.Demis Hassabis, the British computer game designer behind Google’s DeepMind, then asks me for directions to the ‘dinner’. Improvising, I direct him vaguely down the corridor.A jovial man in glasses also approaches me to ask where ‘the conference’ is. It is Jose Manuel Barroso, former president of the European Commission, now chairman of Goldman Sachs International. He is surrounded by four people all clamouring to talk to him, and he looks like the cat that got the cream.All attendees are also given yellow paper ‘score cards’ on which they must give TripAdvisor-style self-evaluation assessments of talks. On each form delegates must rate discussions on a scale of one to five including ‘importance of topic’, ‘quality of panellist’, ‘interaction’ and so on.The discussions include such subjects as: ‘Populism In Europe’, ‘The U.S. Before Mid-Terms’ (in other words, Donald Trump) ‘The Future Of Work’, ‘Jobs, Skills, Wages’ and ‘Whither Free Trade?’ — plus the more ambiguous ‘Where Are We?’      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/15/13/4D43CD4A00000578-0-image-a-8_1529064545021.jpg","title":"Albanian sneaked UK lorry tracked resort bolthole","story":"    Elidon Habilaj (pictured) claimed to be fleeing torture in war-torn KosovoAfter sneaking into Dover illegally on a lorry, Elidon Habilaj claimed to be fleeing torture in war-torn Kosovo.In truth, he had come from Albania – but he was able to claim asylum by using a fake name.Having hoodwinked the authorities and won the right to stay, he might have kept a low profile. Instead, he conned his way into a job with the \u0027British FBI\u0027 hunting fugitives – only to go on the run himself when he was finally found out.The 40-year-old was jailed for 18 months in his absence after gaining UK citizenship by lying to officials.Now the Mail has tracked down the former Scotland Yard and Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) intelligence officer to his bolthole in the seaside resort of Vlore in his homeland.He has spent six years there hiding from the UK authorities he once worked for – even boasting of his experience with the British police to gain security work in Albania. Ironically, Soca – now part of the National Crime Agency, nicknamed the British FBI – had been investigating Habilaj without realising he was one of its employees.The Albanian arrived in Britain in 1998, and claimed he was a Kosovan named Bekim Ademi. He said his brother had been tortured to death and his father killed by the Kosovan Liberation Army.It\u0027s time to set up migrant processing centres in AFRICA,...Radicalised asylum seekers have murdered or injured more...Share this articleBritish authorities believed him, and he was granted full asylum in November 2001, and citizenship five years later.He was hired by the Metropolitan Police and later Soca, where he worked as an intelligence officer in its London-based \u0027fugitive location team\u0027, helping to find suspected criminals wanted for extradition. He was finally unmasked after checking his own file on a work database of people of interest. Habilaj even called up a photo of himself on his computer screen in front of his boss.Belated checks revealed that he had been born in Albania rather than Kosovo, he never had a brother, and his father was alive and still living in his home town. After he absconded before his trial, Judge Martyn Zeidman QC issued a bench warrant, which instructs police to arrest Habilaj if he is traced. The warrants remain live and legally in force until the suspect is caught or voluntarily returns to face justice.          Habilaj has spent six years there hiding from the UK authorities he once worked forHabilaj was subsequently tried in his absence and jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court in January 2013 after being convicted of obtaining leave to enter or remain in the UK by deception and fraud.The sentencing judge Simon Wilkinson said: \u0027He pretended to be a Kosovan and he was an Albanian who made up tales of atrocities to evoke sympathy.\u0027But he has successfully evaded British authorities, and this week we found him overseeing building work on a hotel he manages on the outskirts of Vlore.He also touts himself as a \u0027freelance security consultant\u0027 and boasts to locals of his time working for the British police – without revealing how his time in the UK came to an abrupt end.When approached by the Mail, Habilaj angrily demanded: \u0027Who has sent you? Who was it who brought you here?\u0027 He then ordered one of his building workers to chase us off the premises.Now a father of one, Habilaj boasts online that he has a degree and master\u0027s in criminology, and also claims to have written books on the subject.In a post written in Albanian and posted on Facebook in 2015, he described how he worked for the \u0027highest British agency against crime for almost two years.\u0027He added: \u0027Before that, I did work for the Metropolitan Police in London at its prestigious centre of Scotland Yard.

The additional countries – China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, Mexico, Bahrain, Serbia, Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Males and Macau – bring the list to 30. Overseas students from these nations will benefit from a streamlined application process, which means they will have to provide fewer documents when applying for visas.Controversially, they will no longer need to submit evidence showing they meet the requirements for living costs of up to £1,265 a month, previous qualifications or evidence they can speak English fluently.In the year to March, a total of 100,769 students from the 11 nations were granted permission to study in the UK.The move was welcomed by universities who have argued for easing restrictions on foreign students, claiming they contribute of £2.3billion annually to the British economy. However, the Migrationwatch think-tank warned of a \u0027slippery slope\u0027, saying: \u0027The last time the student visa system was loosened in 2009 it took years to recover from the massive inflow of bogus students, especially from India.\u0027In other measures, an immigration route for highly-skilled iniduals is to be widened to include fashion designers.

He is understood to have told police he had sex with the teenage British tourist, but said it was consensual.          Olusola Odejayi, pictured, has reportedly told Spanish police that he had consensual sex with the teenagerCarmen Robles Zamora said in her written ruling justifying her decision to release the arrested men and go against the wishes of a state prosecutor who wanted them remanded in jail ahead of a possible trial: \u0027Although the victim\u0027s statement has credibility and was made when she was very upset, the report by the forensic doctor does not show any type of injury or even bruising on her thighs and genital area when the victim has stated she was a virgin.\u0027Contrasting that with the \u0027credibility and coherence\u0027 of the men\u0027s version of events, relayed to her during a closed hearing at a court in Ibiza Town after they were taken from a police station in handcuffs, she said: \u0027For these reasons there are reasonable doubts of the existence of the commission of the crime which has motivated this current judicial investigation.\u0027The document also makes it clear that Ahearne-Grant is not being probed on suspicion of participating in the alleged sex attack, but over two recordings on his mobile phone which he subsequently erased.The reason he is said to have made the recordings - and exactly what he took footage of - has not been made clear.Local paper Diario de Ibiza reported today the phone would be sent to Madrid for police analysis as part of attempts to recover the erased footage.          Reeco Hackett-Fairchild, pictured, made his debut for Charlton last year scoring twicePolice and court officials could not be reached for comment.The incident which sparked the three arrests is said to have happened at a hotel in Cala de Bou near the party resort of San Antonio after the alleged victim and a female friend met them at a bar and agreed to go back to their hotel.A Spanish National Police spokesman said after the first two arrests: \u0027National Police officers arrested two English men on Tuesday in San Jose in Ibiza as the suspected authors of a sex attack.\u0027The parents of the 19-year-old victim, who is also British, reported the incident to police.\u0027It would appear the victim and a female friend of hers who were on holiday in Ibiza with the victim\u0027s parents, went to San Antonio on Monday afternoon and met several lads from a football team in the UK in a bar there.\u0027Both women agreed to go back with the some of the men to the hotel they were staying at, in the municipality of San Jose.\u0027Once they were in a room, one of the youngsters was allegedly sexually attacked by one of the players, while a second took hold of her and a third recorded her on a mobile phone.\u0027After the incident, the visibly affected victim and her friend left the hotel to go back to the woman\u0027s parents.\u0027The victim\u0027s parents quickly suspected something was wrong and after discovering what had happened, went to speak to the National Police.\u0027National Police officers went to the hotel where those allegedly responsible for the sex attack were staying, and subsequently arrested two men.\u0027The police investigations are ongoing and further arrests in the coming hours have not been ruled out.\u0027The spokesman confirmed the third arrest on Thursday morning, describing the detainee as a 26-year-old British national.A well-placed police source said at the time: \u0027The third man held is the suspected sex attacker.\u0027One of the two men held on Tuesday is suspected of holding the woman down during the alleged sex attack and the other of recording it.\u0027The judicial investigation - which is taking place behind closed doors - will now seek to determine the involvement of each of the three men in the incident and clarify if police have been given an accurate version of events by the alleged victim, her friend and the three men.The female holidaymaker was asked to ratify her original police statement to the courts. It is believed she has already done so.Local reports earlier this week said one of the men - thought to be Ahearne-Grant - told police and the judge he was in another room with the alleged victim\u0027s friend and got involved in an altercation with the other two men after hearing noise and going to investigate.Cala de Bou, which is in the municipality of San Jose, is a popular location for tourists looking to stay somewhere quieter than San Antonio but within easy reach of the brash party resort.It is just seven miles from the airport and home to a number of hotels and short-stay holiday apartments.Ahearne-Grant, born in Greenwich is a forward who signed with League One side Charlton as a 17-year-old in September 2014.He has made more than 60 appearances with the club in Championship and League One football and has played for England at U17, U18 and U19.Redbridge-born Hackett-Fairchild made his professional debut with Charlton in August last year, and hit the net twice in 12 appearances.He has previously spent time with Dagenham \u0026amp Redbridge and Dulwich Hamlet.A Charlton Athletic spokesman said: \u0027The club have been made aware and are looking into this matter.\u0027Due to the ongoing investigation we will not be commenting any further at this stage.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/16/10/4D4BC80800000578-0-image-a-21_1529140352007.jpg","title":"Turkish president Erdogan claims Uber finished Turkey","story":"    President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the ride hailing app Uber is \u0027finished\u0027 in Turkey, following intense pressure from Istanbul taxi drivers for the service to be banned\u0027This thing emerged called Uber or Muber or whatever,\u0027 said Erdogan. \u0027But this issue is now finished.

On this particular expedition, we shall travel to a vast, desolate, white expanse stretching onward to the horizon in all directions.”Burning Man, the weeklong counterculture festival and arts jamboree, has continued to take place each August, with some 70,000 people converging on the dry bed of an ancient lake in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert. The event is not what it was: the drive-by shooting range is gone, tickets cost hundreds of dollars, and there is a real danger of running into Elon Musk. But its founding principles are still upheld. These include “radical inclusion”, “radical self-reliance” and “radical self-expression”.Fifty years on from the first publication of Desert Solitaire, Edward Abbey’s classic account of his time as a ranger in Utah’s Arches national park, the desert still represents freedoms unavailable elsewhere. Abbey could evoke the raw, alarming beauty of arid landscapes as effectively as any writer, but he was also capable of startling cruelty and obtuseness, particularly towards immigrants. In a 1977 essay titled The Great American Desert he at once extols the desert’s appeal and discourages those who would follow him there. “Survival hint #1: Stay out of there. Don’t go. Stay home and read a good book, this one for example.” As well as the bloodsucking kissing bug and a half-dozen species of rattlesnake, there are black widows, Gila monsters, the deadly poisonous coral snakes and the giant, hairy desert scorpions. “Something about the desert,” he adds, “inclines all living things to harshness and acerbity.”Chief among Abbey’s literary forebears was art historian John C Van Dyke, who in The Desert (1901) wrote a treatise that transformed America’s vision of its arid south-west. It was an act of aesthetic rehabilitation of a realm that had been deemed not only valueless but inimical to the national spirit of Manifest Destiny. For the first time, the American desert was described in terms that not merely eulogised its beauties but proposed it as an image of transcendence. A longing for solitude extended to Van Dyke’s writing: “Heaven knows the literature of humanity is large enough without dragging it into such sublime isolations as the desert.” Accordingly we meet hardly a single living, breathing human in his book.If Abbey inherited one vice from Van Dyke it was that “harshness and acerbity” he observed of the land itself, a conviction that the desert – not to say the planet – would be perfect but for its one defining taint: humankind. TE Lawrence (“Lawrence of Arabia”), too, writing to Ernest Thurtle in 1929, insisted that “what is wanted is a new master species – birth control for us, to end the human race in 50 years – and then a clear field for some cleaner mammal”. Tongue-in-cheek, perhaps, but this was the Lawrence who, crossing the Sinai in 1917, saw himself mirrored in his Bedouin companions: “His sterile experience robbed him of compassion and perverted his human kindness to the image of the waste in which he hid … he found luxury in abnegation, renunciation, self-restraint.”Another British traveller in the Middle East, Wilfred Thesiger, recalling his marathon journeys in the Arabian peninsula’s Empty Quarter in the 1940s, wrote: “Sex has been of no great consequence to me, and the celibacy of desert life left me untroubled.” For Thesiger and Lawrence, as for the Desert Fathers who founded Christian monasticism in third-century Egypt, the desert promised sanctuary not just from society but from the importunate, unclean body.The confusion of flight with quest is a theme of many contemporary desert texts. Taking for granted canonical dryland novels such as Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian (1985) and Michael Ondaatje’s The English Patient (1992), a modern desert library might include Jim Crace’s hallucinogenic novel of Christ’s years in the wilderness, Quarantine (1997), French-Egyptian Jewish poet Edmond Jabès’s exquisite desert koans written during the 1980s from his exile in Paris and Sven Lindqvist’s anti-colonial Saharan odyssey, Desert Divers (2002). In Kim Mahood’s 2016 “memoir-map”, Position Doubtful, the artist, returning to the Australian interior of her childhood, describes a “sense of the desert as a presence in my body, as if in my trajectory across it I have absorbed it”.The modern literature of America’s south-west alerts us to the land’s contested nature. The desert in Charles Bowden’s astonishing apocalyptic non-fiction trilogy Inferno, ExodusÉxodo and Trinity (2006–9) is a boneyard scattered with the remains of slaughtered narcos and lost migrants, and trembling under the legacy of nuclear testing. Rebecca Solnit’s 1994 Savage Dreams reveals the “hidden wars of the American West”, including the 953 nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site that “turned the desert itself into a scapegoat for the political conflicts of a nation”. Published this year, former border patrol agent Francisco Cantú’s lacerating memoir The Line Becomes a River is an artful reminder that America’s border deserts continue to be weaponised against undocumented migrants attempting to enter the US from Mexico.The title of Hari Kunzru’s 2011 novel Gods Without Men references Balzac’s description of the desert as a place “where God is and man is not”. A hyperactive, polyphonic, time-twisting excursion into arid California, it opens with a modern fable. Sick of his life, the trickster Coyote god of Native American myth decides to “go out into the desert and cook”. What he cooks is the drug methamphetamine – crystal meth. In an RV converted into a mobile lab, assisted by “Cottontail Rabbit” and “Gila Monster”, Coyote eventually – after twice accidentally killing himself – synthesises “a hundred grams of pure crystal”.The story recalls a 2009 episode of the TV series Breaking Bad, “4 Days Out”, in which Walter White, chemistry teacher turned meth-cooker, believing he is dying from lung cancer, persuades his young associate, Jesse Pinkman, to help him prepare a consignment big enough to provide for his family after his death. With Blue Mink’s “Good Morning Freedom” blasting from the RV’s stereo, they drive out of Albuquerque until there is nothing but scorched grassland stretching to every horizon.This is the classic American desert, a frontier defined less by an absence of water than of oversight – what the great scrutineer of the west Mary Austin called a “country of lost borders”. (It is also a country of global nightmares: 120 miles south of Albuquerque is the Jornado del Muerto desert, site of the world’s first nuclear explosion, in 1945.) Inevitably, the RV’s battery dies and they run out of water. When Walter vanishes, Jesse finds him staring into the desert, a stigmata of lung-blood hawked into one palm.In ‘The Great American Desert’, Abbey asks: ‘Why the desert, given a world of such splendour and variety?’ Then he tells a story. Hiking in Arizona, he climbed the wall of a canyon and found laid out on the rim an “arrow sign, three feet long, formed of stones”. It pointed in the direction of “sand and desert rock under the same old wide and aching sky”. Abbey reckoned it had been there for at least a century. Searching for whatever the arrow was pointing to – “an ancient Indian ruin, a significant cairn, perhaps an abandoned mine” – he finally understood. The arrow pointed to “nothing at all. Nothing but the desert. Nothing but the silent world.”Anyone who has been lost in the desert might wonder if the arrow was not simply a way-marker, but the Desert Fathers (there were some Mothers, too) were familiar with Abbey’s ‘nothing at all’. For them it was paneremos, the ‘uttermost desert’, while French travellers in the Sahara in the eighteenth century knew it as le désert absolu. ‘The desert in its absence of the things of this world manifests the presence of the next,’ as Solnit puts it in Savage Dreams.The image of Walter and Jesse’s immobilised RV seething in the American nothing evokes not only the pair’s isolation, but the landscape’s crushing indifference. As Abbey knew, “the desert doesn’t give a shit”. The French cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard, travelling through the same landscape in the 1980s, observed that “the silence of the desert is a visual thing, too. A product of the gaze that stares out and finds nothing to reflect it.” In Breaking Bad, the stillness of the desert and its silence are heightened by the fitful buzzing of a fly or a raven’s caw, and by a soundtrack that resembles something being heated until it sings – aural mainstays of desert movies from Nicholas Ray’s Bitter Victory (1957) to Wim Wenders’s Paris, Texas (1984), Mahamat-Saleh Haroun’s Daratt (2006) and this year’s Lean on Pete. For Baudrillard, the American desert was inextricable from the cinematic desert. “It is useless,” he wrote in America (1988), “to seek to strip the desert of its cinematic aspects in order to restore its original essence those features are thoroughly superimposed upon it.” Wobbling like a mutating cell, the sun hanging above the dehydrated pair is an image straight out of David Lean’s 1962 biopic Lawrence of Arabia, and I wonder if it’s just coincidence that Walter wears his own pitiful version of Lawrence’s Bedouin headdress: a soiled towel wound with a bungee cord.Jesse might by now be regretting skipping a visit to the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, suggested by his girlfriend back in Albuquerque. O’Keeffe first visited Taos, New Mexico, in 1929, buying a house there in 1940 and finally leaving New York and moving to the state permanently in 1949. To walk in a desert – assuming you have water and are not lost – is to be a kind of beachcomber: the wonder of each object’s “thingness”, its particularity and significance, are amplified by the environment’s very sparsity. O’Keeffe’s paintings often focus on these singular findings: a crucifix, a tree, a flower. Her famous skulls, she insisted, were not memento mori: “The bones seem to cut sharply to the centre of something that is very keenly alive on the desert, even tho’ it is empty and untouchable.”This arid landscape, for O’Keeffe, knew “no kindness with all its beauty” but as a marginal realm the desert has always been confidant and consolation to those at society’s margins. Between 1992 and 2007, photographer Laura Aguilar, who died in April, took several series of nude self-portraits in the deserts of New Mexico, Texas and California. Aguilar – gay, Mexican-American and with long-term ill health – produced a body of work that, like O’Keeffe’s, asserts an unanswerable claim on cowboy territory. In her images she is folded and slumped over rocks, or crouched in what might be one of O’Keeffe’s dry washes, her face concealed, her monumental body at once echoing the desert’s geology and strikingly organic – like the land itself, seemingly dead and alive at the same time. Setting the hairless human form against the sparsely vegetated land, Aguilar’s work is not Lawrence’s quest for “abnegation, renunciation, self-restraint” but rather a celebration of the rapport that can exist between body and topography.If the desert can function as a symbol of transcendence, it is also a symbol of death: silent and apparently inert, topography picked away to its geological bones. As long ago as 1901, Van Dyke looked heavenwards and asked: “Have we not proof in our own moon that worlds die? Perhaps it died through thousands of years with the slow evaporation of moisture and the slow growth of the desert.”By 2020, 60 million people are expected to have migrated from sub-Saharan Africa alone due to the degradation of fertile land by overgrazing, cutting down trees, mining, unregulated irrigation and climate change. Desertification, as these processes are known collectively, is described by the UN as “among the greatest environmental challenges of our time”.If Van Dyke’s science was flawed (the moon, unlike Mars, has always been dry), his questions might unsettle even the most dreamy solipsist, gazing out at the desert in 2018. “Is then this great expanse of sand and rock the beginning of the end?” he asks. “Is that the way our globe shall perish?” •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a17f6f92a6602008b2ae099f0b68462efc8af41/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=764a14bc57f7c4b88bfc1bec744d1e46","title":"world cup expected to boost uk sales of big screen tvs","story":"John Lewis says sales jumped on day of opening ceremony and expects further increases before England’s first gameFootball fans are expected to go on a World Cup-fuelled TV buying binge this weekend before England’s first match of the 2018 tournament.Advances in technology has led to ever larger screens. The best selling sizes this year are 55in and 70in, according to John Lewis. In 2010 the best sellers were 36in when South Africa hosted the World Cup.“The World Cup definitely seems to be having a big effect on customers,” said Suddy Bhardwaj, TV buyer at the retailer. He said the increase in demand was not just about football but about a change in viewing habits, and that a fall in the price of big screen TVs was making them more affordable to families who increasingly wanted a “cinema experience” at home. While it has traditionally been men who drove demand for large televisions, Bhardwaj suggested that was now changing.“It feels like there’s a new market in the way people view TVs. Netflix and huge programmes like Game of Thrones coupled with services like Deliveroo and the ability to have restaurant-quality food at home means that people are bringing the cinema and dining experience home.”Argos said its sales were up by more than a third this week, compared with the same time last year. It said sales of TVs with screens of 65 inches or more had nearly doubled in the last 12 months.Market research firm GfK predicts that ultra-high definition and 4K technology TVs will massively outsell other sets in May and June.“This year’s World Cup sees the most 4K-quality broadcasts than ever before, which is really driving customers to invest in 4K TVs as well as large screens,” said Nick Hill, consumer electronics trading manager at Argos.The mini sales boom is a fillip for retailers who are struggling amid rising costs just as shoppers rein in spending on non-essentials partly because of inflation in food and fuel prices.But they will be praying that England, who kick off their World Cup campaign on Monday, go beyond the group stages as an early exit could mean sales of 66,000 less TVs than hoped for, according to GfK.In 2010, 9.6m TVs were sold in the UK, falling to just 5m last year, according to the firm. And even with the World Cup boost this year only 5.5m TVs are expected to be sold compared with the 6.5m in 2014, the last World Cup year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dec3987d28aa1c0674a1964e894ab064198c0d0b/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fad178dcd31dd2e92f80e40f6c5a6bc2","title":"temporal bandwith social media alan jacobs","story":"Our era of relentless social media and soundbites has caused us to lose sight of the past, and future It is hard to imagine a time more completely presentist than our own, more tethered to the immediate and is hard to imagine a person more exemplary of our presentism than the current president of the United States.Donald Trump is a creature of the instant, responsive only and wholly to immediate stimulus – which is why Twitter is his exclusive medium of written communication, and why when he speaks he cannot stick to a script. In this respect he differs little from anyone who spends a lot of time on social media the social media ecosystem is designed to generate constant, instantaneous responses to the provocations of Now.We cannot, from within that ecosystem, restore old behavioral norms or develop new and better ones. No, to find a healthier alternative, we must cultivate what the great American novelist Thomas Pynchon calls “temporal bandwidth” – an awareness of our experience as extending into the past and the future.In Pynchon’s 1973 novel Gravity’s Rainbow, an engineer named Kurt Mondaugen explains that temporal bandwidth is “the width of your present, your now … The more you dwell in the past and future, the thicker your bandwidth, the more solid your persona. But the narrower your sense of Now, the more tenuous you are.”If we want to extend our bandwidth, we begin with the past, because exploring the past requires only willingness. Recently, I was teaching the Epistles of the Roman poet Horace to a group of undergraduates. Though Horace comes from a world alien in so many ways to ours – and though he would surely fail any possible test of political correctness of the left or right – we found ourselves resonating powerfully with his quest for “a tranquil mind”. Indeed, Horace recommends just what I am arguing for now: “Interrogate the writings of the wise,” he counsels his friend Lollius Maximus:“Asking them to tell you how you canGet through your life in a peaceable tranquil way.Will it be greed, that always feels poverty-stricken,That harasses and torments you all your days?Will it be hope and fear about trivial things,In anxious alternation in your mind?Where is it virtue comes from, is it from books?Or is it a gift from Nature that can’t be learned?What is the way to become a friend to yourself?What brings tranquility? What makes you care less?”(This from David Ferry’s marvelous translation.) Horace doesn’t tell you that you need to delete your social media accounts or somehow stop worrying about economic precarity. He’s asking questions here – but they are the right questions, questions that re-orient us to other possibilities for living than the ones handed to us each morning when we pick up our smartphones. “The past is a foreign country they do things differently there,” in LP Hartley’s famous line, which of course doesn’t mean that what “they do” is always right – but awareness of it is always illuminating.To read old books is to get an education in possibility for next to nothing. Watching the latest social media war break out, I often recall Grace Kelly’s character in High Noon, a Quaker pacifist, saying: “I don’t care who’s right or who’s wrong. There’s got to be some better way for people to live.” (That by the end of the movie she abandons her pacifism only emphasizes, if ironically, the importance of her point.) The suspicion that there’s got to be some better way has the welcome effect of suppressing the thoughtless, kneejerk reflexion that is a byproduct of our age.To increase your temporal bandwidth in the direction of the past is to make yourself less vulnerable to the cruelties of, for example, descending in wrath on a young woman whose clothing you disapprove of, or firing an employee because of a tweet you didn’t take time to understand. You realize that you need not obey the impulses of this moment – which, it seems safe to say, tend not to produce a tranquil mind.Another benefit of reflecting on the past is awareness of the ways that actions in one moment reverberate into the future. You see that some decisions that seemed trivial when they were made proved immensely important, while others which seemed world-transforming quickly sank into insignificance. The “tenuous” self, sensitive only to the needs of This Instant, always believes – often incorrectly – that the present is infinitely consequential. That frame of mind is dangerously susceptible to alarmist notions, like the idea that “2016 is the Flight 93 election: charge the cockpit or you die” – a claim that many Trump supporters accepted as gospel, without even inquiring what “die” might mean in that context.Only a severe constriction of temporal bandwidth could make such a claim seem even possible. I did not vote for Hillary Clinton and cannot envision circumstances in which I would have done so, but the idea that her election would mean death (even metaphorical death) for conservatives and Christians is absurd. It would, rather, have meant the continuation of the centrist policies of her predecessor. The idea that the United States in 2016 was faced with a choice between Trump and Death, an idea driven by ignorance of even the recent past, also had the effect of disabling care for the future.What will Trump’s policies do to international trade? What will they do to immigrant families, including those in this country legally? What will they do to the increasingly toxic state of race relations? What will they do to the health of the planet? The Trump-or-Death binary dismissed all those questions as irrelevant, and we are living with the consequences.But these questions are essential, if we are to extend our temporal bandwidth into the future as well as the past. (And the refusal of them shows how indifference to the past makes it impossible to consider the future.) I am a Christian, and I have been dismayed at how easily many of my fellow Christians have cast aside their long-held convictions, merely to exchange their rich birthright for a cold serving of Trumpian triumphalism. As David French recently wrote in National Review, in an open letter to his fellow evangelicals: “Soon enough, the ‘need’ to defend Trump will pass. He’ll be gone from the American scene. Then, you’ll stand in the wreckage of your own reputation and ask yourself, ‘Was it worth it?’ The answer will be as clear then as it should be clear now. It’s not, and it never was.”The bitter irony here is that so many American Christians, who often claim to have “an eternal perspective”, turned out, in 2016, to have no perspective beyond that of the immediate moment. They have left their own future, and that of the country they claim to love, uncared for and unreflected on. Someday, along will come some politician they despise whose personal morality will be even more contemptible than Trump’s, and they will be reduced to silence – or, if they insist on speaking out anyway, will merely testify to their own rank hypocrisy. “Was it worth it?”Forty years ago, the German philosopher Hans Jonas, in a book that would prove a vital inspiration for the Green movement in his country, asked a potent question: “What force shall represent the future in the present?” In other words, what laws and norms will embody our care for those who come after us, including those already here and those yet to be born? But this is a question that we cannot ask if our thoughts are imprisoned by the stimulation of what rolls across our Twitter and Facebook feeds.Pynchon’s Mondaugen comments on the personal tenuousness of those who live only in the moment: “It may get to where you’re having trouble remembering what you were doing five minutes ago.” And of course, no person so afflicted can recall, much less be accountable for, what he said yesterday, which is why those who work for Donald Trump have had to learn that yesterday’s truth is today’s lie, and today’s lie will be tomorrow’s truth.But, again, Trump didn’t create this situation: he found in social media and soundbite TV news an environment ready-made for the instincts he already possessed, an environment in which tenuousness is less a condition to lament than the primary instrument of ultimate celebrity and ultimate power. Trump may be 71 years old, but he is the future of our collective temperament – unless we develop some temporal bandwidth. It’s best that we start now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f30c0855ac50610925335f99a4544c2c2b1deaa/37_4_4859_2916/master/4859.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e0e69966f5b1e6ad59405fff6ca0b28","title":"from scandi fika to jamaican jerk how to travel the world without leaving the uk","story":"From Cantonese cuisine in Manchester to Italian gardens in Wales, soak up the UK’s rich culture and you can feel like a globetrotter wherever you areAs an island nation, the UK has never been short of visiting adventurers and settlers seeking a different place to call home.

Stand beside the 17th-century houses in Pittenweem harbour and it will look like you’re in Belgium – the steeped gables and pantile roofs will give your photos a feel that is not typically Scottish. At the end of your architecture trawl, head to the village of Crail where boats will be bringing in their catch of crabs and lobster – at the Lobster Hut you can buy them cooked and dressed and eat alfresco on the harbour wall.

It is the best-preserved frontier of the Roman empire, which ruled much of England for almost 400 years. Along the wall you will find the Roman town of Corbridge, and Roman temples and forts – as well as some incredible homes to stay in.Search for homes on Airbnb in historic NorthumberlandFind Little JamaicaWant to get your jerk on?

Sofia Genders, co-founder of End of the Road Festival and Sheffield insider, has your ultimate 48-hour guide to the cityDay one – yoga, shopping and arty hangoutsExplore what Sheffield’s buzzing neighbourhoods have to offer. Spend the morning getting to know the hip, leafy suburb of Nether Edge – start with a yoga class at Hot Yoga Sheffield on Edgedale Road, then grab a healthy smoothie at the Wild Leaf cafe next door. Yoga was such a great stress-buster when I was running End of the Road festival, and it never fails to put me in a great frame of mind, whether I’m working or enjoying a day off.Next, take a stroll to nearby Abbeydale Road, also known as the antiques quarter. On the first Sunday of the month this vintage wonderland of a street also hosts a flea market at the Abbeydale Picture House – a gorgeous old venue that regularly screens black-and-white early cinema and hosts various cultural events. Spend some time wandering around the Vaults to find something special among the weird and wonderful retro items, or try the eclectic Rileys \u0026amp Co for vintage furniture, kitsch collectables and local crafts. I also love finding bargains in charity shops – there are quite a few along Abbeydale Road. Sticking with the retro theme, a visit to Jameson’s Cafe \u0026amp Tea Rooms is my all-time favourite afternoon tea spot, with great service and a live pianist. Two minutes walk down the road, there’s a great secondhand record store called Below. Also close by on Nether Edge Road, is the intimate and laid back Cafe #9 – perfect for a pick-me-up, plus they host live music now and again.As the afternoon rolls on, head to the villagey Sharrow Vale Road, where you can browse independent shops, delis and boutiques – such as the Front Parlour or Porter Book Shop – before grabbing an artisan doughnut and coffee from Eve Kitchen.If you need something more substantial, you could grab a late lunch from Porter Pizza on Sharrow Vale Road, probably the best pizza in town. It’s takeaway-only but the gorgeous Endcliffe Park is just around the corner, and is a top spot for a pizza picnic and a quick post-lunch stroll around the beautiful woodland.Alternatively, hop in a cab to Chesterfield Road in the up-and-coming Meersbrook area. Here, vegans are in luck: Make No Bones restaurant on Chesterfield Road is a true local’s favourite, or Just Falafs, on the same street, is a great fallback. That’s not to say that carnivores aren’t also well catered for in the area. I also really love the Tramshed Bar \u0026amp Kitchen – they’ve got a brilliant Asian menu, or you could just pop into the bar for a drink or two.Speaking of drinks, in the evening, Takk bar on Queens Road, Heeley, right on the edge of Sheffield city centre, is a great place for a dance and a cocktail in a fairy lit garden. You’ll find it in Hagglers Corner, a creative courtyard community of artists and independent makers, which doubles as an arts venue. If pubs are more your thing, the Brothers Arms and the Sheaf View are both nearby and have a reputation for top quality real ale.If you’re after a gig, try the Audacious Art Experiment, the eponymous venue of the local record label, on Harwood Street. Alternatively, head back to Abbeydale Road and check out Picture House Social, for an eclectic line-up of music events, with great cocktails, craft beer, Italian-inspired street food and a games room, too. I’m a big fan of small, independent venues with creative programming as they’re vital to a healthy music industry – both are destinations for the in-the-know crowd and have some great shows on.Day two – coffee, cake and creative curationThe second day is when you’ll find out what the city centre has to offer, plus a visit to Kelham Island, a riverside area that was once the central hub of Sheffield’s industry, and one of the oldest sites of its kind in the city.Start your day with a good coffee. There are so many great places to choose from, depending on where you are based. Tamper is a New Zealand coffee place with an industrial feel – its main outpost is housed in a 19th-century former silversmith workshop on Arundel Street. On the same street is the Holt, a true hidden gem of a coffee place, while tucked away on Aberdeen Court is Steam Yard, with a cosy feel and amazing cakes.Spend the rest of your morning checking out some of the best shops the city has to offer – in particular stroll along Division Street and the surrounding roads. Syd and Mallory sells the best handmade clothing and reworked fashion. La Biblioteka is a great little bookshop stocking a massive range of magazines and books from independent publishers, plus stationery. When I’m looking for good music, I often discover something new and fresh at Bear Tree Records – a lovely shop that sells both new and secondhand vinyl.While you wander, keep your eyes peeled. Sheffield is full of great street art, sculpture, graffiti and wall murals by local artists such as Jo Peel, Faunagraphic, Phlegm and more. Street Art Sheffield lists many of the sites if you’d like to plan ahead. One of my favourite sculptures is the Women of Steel by Martin Jennings outside City Hall. It commemorates the women who worked in the city’s steel industry during the first and second world wars.After a morning stroll, stop for lunch at Dina Diner, a vegetarian and vegan cafe attached to a music, comedy, poetry and theatre venue that is a social enterprise and platform for emerging artists. Dina is an example of what I like about most of Sheffield’s creative spaces: the really thoughtful curation. Similarly, Gloam Gallery is another great space dedicated to creativity. Gloam’s Instagram is exciting and exhibitions here are fresh and unusual. In September, the Site Gallery will also be re-opening – another great creative space to check out.For dinner head to Kelham Island and the cosy, neighbourhood restaurant Stew and Oyster. Later in the evening, check out the Delicious Clam – a record label and an unmissable DIY venue where you’re guaranteed to hear something interesting and underground. A lot of bands start out there and it’s worth catching a show if you can. Something entirely different is Public, a recently-opened cocktail bar in a converted old public toilet – it’s another small venue, and really worth it.Last but not least, be sure to check out what is one of the best railway station pubs in the country – the Sheffield Tap, a place where my husband and I love to sit and watch the world go by. Located within the old first-class waiting room, this pub is also a microbrewery and has a great selection of craft beers. Enjoy and don’t worry if you miss your train home as Sheffield has more than enough to offer for further adventures.

In fact, with its fixie bikes, cobbled streets, Noma-ish foraged cuisine and design-first ethos, it almost feels like a pocket of Copenhagen that just happens to be a 90-minute train ride from London. Throw in the refurbished 1920s theme park Dreamland and it all adds up to an irresistible artist’s enclave for a weekend city. Armed with effusive recommendations from my Airbnb host Clare – a trend-forecaster and trainee florist ­– I set about experiencing the best of the Kentish coast’s new capital of cool. Here’s my guide to getting the best out of a trip to this unique seaside town.Follow the foodie trailThe seafront chippies are still drawing crowds (and e-bombing seagulls) but in recent years, Margate’s culinary scene has evolved. Open since 2015, Hantverk \u0026amp Found is a seafood cafe and gallery that exemplifies that uptick in quality, whether you’re after a big last-night-of-the-trip dinner or a casual lunch slurping local rock oysters spiked with yuzu (a citrus fruit) in the suntrap garden. The food is unfussy and brightly flavoured – think clams in a spicy Korean broth and bream with a heady brown shrimp butter. The dinky emerald-tiled room adds a lively, squashed-in thrum to proceedings.For a legendary cheese toastie, and great rooftop views for sunset, head to Cheesy Tiger on the jutting Harbour Arm, my Airbnb host advises. There’s also friendly little Fez bar, a quirky, eclectic boozer close by. Or for an array of beachfront eating and drinking options, then the The Bus Cafe – with its crammed and zingy salad wraps – and the adjacent Sun Deck, are the places to head to. “There’s a really good juice bar, Po’ Boy that does great Creole-style food, and a cool tiki bar,” says Ed Warren, local and co-founder of Cliffs record shop and cafe.Sound out local musicThere aren’t many cafes where you can watch an experimental radio show broadcasting to the world and have a flat white made by a double Mercury Music prize-winning nominee. A labour of love for musician Obara Ejimiwe (aka Ghostpoet) and his creative director wife Kate, Radio Margate is a hybrid coffee shop, late-night venue and internet radio station launched in 2017 following their move from London. This sea-view space – all calming jazz and tasteful mid-century furniture – is, according to the Ejimiwes, a direct result of Margate’s contagious creative energy. “It’s totally infectious and there’s more room here to develop strong, independent ideas,” Obara says.Housed in a lovingly restored former 1920s tearoom in Cliftonville, Cliffs is a record shop that also encompasses a fitness studio, coffee roastery, hair salon, gig venue and an exceptional cafe (try the harissa oil and avocado toast). “I just wanted to sell Motown records but we got caught up in it all, like a lot of people here do,” says owner Ed Warren, explaining how he and his interior designer partner Kier Muddiman found themselves presiding over this artfully-distressed cultural fiefdom. “All these interesting little places in Margate are from the heart, basically.”Hit refreshWalpole Bay tidal pool is a must for lovers of outdoor swimming. It is the UK’s largest saltwater bathing pool, covering 4 acres (1.6 hectares), and was built in 1937. A group of locals swear by a regular swim in this beautiful coastal location, which fills up at high tide each day. “The first time I jumped in I squealed with excitement as the cold water engulfed me,” says Kathryn Ferguson, Margate resident and director of Taking the Waters, a short film about the pool. “But it felt exhilarating and from that moment I was totally hooked. A full moon swim is something I’d recommend everyone to try once.”Sticking with the theme of wellness, it’s worth stopping by natural fragrance and skincare company Haeckels to pick up a few restorative products to take home. One of the town’s most famous success stories, it was founded by Dom Bridges, a former film director who turned a hobby making soap from foraged Margate seaweed into a brand stocked in Harvey Nichols. Still, little can prepare you for the surprise of its flagship laboratory, shop and sea-based thalassotherapy spa, high up on a blustery Cliftonville parade. “It’s an example of the fact that each business has an amazing story of its own,” says Shelly Keeys, owner of shrewdly curated local fashion store Ruskin.Shop independent art and designThose that know their parlour palms from their succulents will feel at home in the jungle interior of Mar Mar, a cafe, gift shop and houseplant emporium on Northdown Road. Bolstering the town’s roster of design boutiques (homewares store Môr is worth a look too), it grew from Central St Martins graduate Boe Holder’s bold, Memphis Group-influenced creations. “She used to do pot painting and sell these great plant pots online,” says Margate-based photographer Harriet Bentley. “Now they’re selling plants, coffee, magazines and other great little things. It’s so cool.”Other interiors shops worth seeking out include: Clayspace Studios, a social enterprise and ceramics store Danish Collectables for curated Scandinavian vintage pieces Papillon Interiors for vibrant indoor and outdoor furniture and Imagineican Store, a tiny design and lifestyle studio. If you hire a bike during your trip, Westgate-on-sea is about a 15-minute cycle from Margate’s seafront, and is home to Eighty Two Westgate.Of course, one of the biggest draws in town for art is the Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and sowed the first seeds for the current regenerative flowering. Smaller venues, such as Pie Factory in the Old Town, also a studio complex and, yes, former pie shop, are increasingly offering a platform to Margate’s thriving ecosystem of emerging visual artists and Turner-exhibited stars of tomorrow. “There’s such a strong creative network here,” notes Dan Chilcott, co-founder of nearby Resort Studios, who put together a June show at the Pie Factory. “As an artist, it’s right where you want to be.”Jimi Famurewa is a London-based freelance writer and editor.

My legs are white, dry and not fastidiously shaved (unless I know they’re to appear before anyone but my family), so I seek products to give them an instant, relatively thoughtless makeover.The best I’ve found in 30 years is Vita Liberata Body Blur (£29.50, 100ml), a gift to anyone who’d like to add instant, realistic, streak-free colour while disguising moderate scars, veins and birthmarks. Its silicone base means it doesn’t rub off on clothing and sheets, or cause my legs to look like melted candles when heavy rain hits. The peerless texture means that one blob on a tanning mitt (buy cheap: they’re all the same) strokes effortlessly on to limbs in seconds. It helps if you’re not freshly basted in thick body cream, which I usually am, but I get around the problem by using Nivea In-Shower Lotion (£2.99, 250ml), which rinses off, leaving a light, fake-tan-friendly coating of moisturiser.If Body Blur is too rich for you (and I hear you, though would add that one tube should last the summer), try to score some scarcely stocked Garnier BB Body Wash-Off Bronzer (£7.99, 150ml), which works in the same way and almost as well (the colour and indelibility aren’t quite as good, but I’m pernickety). If wash‑offs don’t appeal, I enthusiastically recommend Self Tanning Drops (£19.95, 30ml) from celebrity tanner (yes, it’s a thing) Jules Von Hep’s excellent new vegan brand, Isle of Paradise. These eliminate everything women hate about self-tanning – the smell, the faff, the orange – by working with the skincare products you use every day. Just mix one to 12 drops into your favourite face or body cream and apply as usual before washing hands. The fewer drops you use, the lighter the tan, so start low and increase. Four drops were just right to tint my milky legs for a solid three days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f1959e5a16dc7150e80371ac0a6de7c3b38de5/0_688_3992_2395/master/3992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=777e432022a3c3bef5e4deeacd2ec79d","title":"mp clive lewis on his fathers style kids said where did you get farahs from","story":"As Father’s Day approaches, the Labour politician recalls what his dad, Tony, taught him about tweed jackets, jogging bottoms and fatherhoodI’m known for wearing tweed jackets, khaki pants and suede shoes. I’ve only worn a suit in parliament under duress, when I was on the front bench. I’ve dressed like this for a while, but only recently realised that it’s pretty much the same way my dad, Tony, dressed when I was growing up. In the early 80s, he went from being a factory worker to a trade union official, going overnight from being a shop steward to driving a car, having a briefcase and travelling around the country as a district officer, and he would wear tweedy type jackets, a shirt, a tie, trousers and comfortable shoes. Me dressing like him is nothing new, though – I was nicking my dad’s shoes and trousers as a teenager. I used to wear his Farah trousers to school, and I remember kids going: “Bloody hell, Lewis, where did you get Farahs from?’When I was growing up, my dad wore a lot of browns and greens – darker colours, autumnal colours. When I was on the BBC news trainee scheme, around the turn of the millennium, we had someone come in and talk to us about what you wear on television, and I was told that khakis, greens and browns went very well with my skin tone. It was something I liked, so I’ve often worn those colours, but maybe I was influenced by my dad as well.In his 40s, my dad refound his youth a bit, and started going to the West Indian club in Northampton, where I’m from, where the West Indian diaspora would go to socialise on a Friday night, and have a drink and a dance to soca and the like. Would I have said there was a West Indian flavour to what he wore, though? Not really. I’ve got uncles who wore garish stuff, you know, electric blue polyester suits, and they carried it off. But my dad never went down that path, he has never been into loud stuff. His style was fashionable, but never sharp. Having said that, when he was growing up in Grenada a bus driver did nickname him “iron shirt” because his clothes were so starched. I’ve seen pictures of him at Sunday school, too, with his siblings and cousins, with their knee socks, shiny shoes and crisp white shirts, partings in their hair. But his style was never overly preened or perfect. Even so, to this day, he still takes care of his appearance. He wears a lot of comfortwear now, but he likes good stuff, quality brands.I remember the first time I appeared on the BBC, on the regional news, I phoned him up and said: ‘What do you think?’ The first thing he said was: ‘Why didn’t you do your tie up properly?’ I just sat there going: ‘What the hell?’ My dad was more interested in how I looked he thought that was really important. And I was like, what about what I said? It was a very “West Indian parent” reaction. He has taught me about certain faux pas, too. I remember I was wearing jogging bottoms with what I thought were trainers, but my dad thought looked like shoes, and he laughed and said you can’t wear shoes with jogging bottoms. His rule was trainers with shorts and jogging bottoms, never shoes. Shoes only went with trousers and jeans. It might seem a bit obvious, but it does look really weird if you don’t follow it.With him being a single dad, we were very close. Our relationship was established at a critical age when I was a teenager, and there was a level of respect that was garnered over those years that at the time I probably didn’t appreciate. He had my best interests at heart – and taught me how to look good, too. As I approach my first Father’s Day with a child of my own, I can fully appreciate it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be7172debc614a736d753f9e64b3e5b1572680bd/0_97_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ee216551609091aa360843b28584736","title":"argentina iceland world cup match report","story":"With 64 minutes gone on a tight, bruising afternoon Argentina finally seemed to have found a break in a game in which their revered attack struggled to find its gears against an excellent Iceland team.The score was already 1-1, as it would finish. Iceland were holding steady. With a long pass from the left Sergio Agüero was suddenly in space in the area, and sent tumbling by a collision with Hördur Magnússon. The penalty was given. Half of the stadium leapt up, phones raised as Lionel Messi stepped up to take it, breath drawn ready to yowl and cheer as the ball hit the net.Or perhaps not. Messi’s kick was terrible, too close to Hannes Halldórsson, who saved well, guessing the right way and palming the ball far enough from goal. In the stands there was a gawping sense of shock, heads cradled, jaws dropped.What an astonishingly brilliant moment, though, for Halldórsson, who six years ago directed Iceland’s entry to the Eurovision song contest, but who has now saved a penalty from Messi in front of a few hundred million people, not to mention his future grand-kids, great grand-kids and anyone else who meets him for the next sixty years with an active YouTube feed.There was controversy a quarter of an hour later when Cristian Pavón went down in the penalty area. There seemed to be contact from Birkir Már Sævarsson but the referee was having none of it and did not refer it to VAR.And so Iceland held on in this Group D opener to take an entirely deserved point from their first ever World Cup game. This is a rise that has been pegged out in moments, from the defeats of Holland and England to the extended glory of qualification for Russia 2018. Here was another one, a new plateau for the smallest nation ever to get to the tournament – albeit against an Argentina team that pressed hard, had most of the possession, and might easily have won the game, but which also presented its own weaknesses to the world.For long periods the general preconceptions about these two teams seemed to be confirmed. Iceland were willing, deft on the ball and completely unafraid. In between its best moments in attack, Argentina came across like a team that had forgotten its trousers on the way out, dressed in full ceremonial regalia on top, but with its long-johns flapping at the back.This was Willy Caballero’s first competitive international at the age of 36. It might well be his last if Franco Armani has been looking smart in training. There was a fumble for Iceland’s goal, one horrible attempt at jazzed-up possession play from the back, and a first-half shot that was palmed away with all the agility of a dead tree falling over in a high wind.Before kick-off on a dazzlingly bright Moscow day the Spartak Arena was gripped with a wonderful rolling surge of noise. Argentina’s travelling fans are present in the usual city-scale numbers. Here they created the usual warm, celebratory noise, a mess of chants and cheers and soaring balladry that manages to be both ferociously inspiring and also somehow devoid of menace.Nobody quite knew how Argentina’s players would hit their stride here. Instead of playing friendlies Argentina have trained with unusual urgency, Jorge Sampaoli grooving his players like a club side. The issue with this team is simply the right jiggle of the switches, finding a way of channelling without clogs or snags the benefits of pure, unfettered Messi power.The sight of Messi’s huge, impassive ginger-bearded face on the big screen as the teams walked out drew the first ear-splitting whistle from the main Albiceleste end.Heimir Hallgrímsson, the Iceland manager, had been phlegmatic as ever on facing Argentina’s own universe-boss level playmaker. “I don’t have a magic formula,” Hallgrímsson shrugged on the eve of this game.In the event Iceland packed the midfield, with Gylfi Sigurdsson, just returned from injury, as a No 10 in possession, a No 8 without the ball. And throughout they played Messi supremely well.Early on Iceland were brusque and bruising. Messi was hauled over the first time he picked up the ball in a pocket of space. At the other end a huge punted long pass from back to front put Alfred Finnbogason for a shot over the bar and from the ensuing sweep-keeper horror show of a goal-kick Birkir Bjarnason scuffed past the post on the run when he looked certain to score.All the while Messi thrummed around in the low gears, with Aaron Gunnarsson always quick to intrude on his personal space. With 16 minutes gone there was a sudden Messi swerve to the left and a powerful shot that Hannes Halldorsson pumped away with both fists. And four minutes later came the reminder that Messi isn’t the only world class footballer in this team.Nobody works a pocket of space quite like Agüero, a player with legs so rubbery he can spring through 180 degree circle in the time it takes you to think about raising your left foot. Here he took the ball in the area and pirouetted away from Ragnar Sigurdsson. No back-lift was required. With swish of air the ball was in the top corner.Even before they levelled the scores Iceland had demonstrated their own cutting edge, and also the brittleness of this Argentina defence. Alfred Finnbogason’s equaliser was the product of excellent Icelandic pressing, drawing slackness down the right and that fumble from Caballero as the cross from Gylfi Sigurdsson came in. Iceland’s centre-forward moved quicker than the swamp-bound defenders around him to poke the ball home.Iceland sat back. Argentina pressed without any real sense of edge, finding little space. There was shout for a penalty as the ball bounced up from close range and hit the hand of the sliding Ragnar Sigurdsson. Sampaoli capered and fumed and waggled his arms on the touchline. But Sigurdsson was guilty of little more than possessing arms in the usual place arms tend to be.For long periods after the break Argentina were ponderous in central midfield against opponents who dropped deep. Up ahead Messi was pushed right to the fringes, handled with remarkable certainty and disincline by this Icelandic midfield and defence. Ángel Di María provided little effective width. On the right Eduardo Salvio made good ground at times. But there was a lack of snap, of easy rhythms in possession. Iceland were able simply to hold their ground.With 53 minutes gone Sampaoli shifted the weather in his team, bringing on the more dextrous Ever Banega for Lucas Biglia. Banega is a lovely midfielder. But Iceland gave him more of the same, crowding in well-drilled pairs, shutting off his angles. There were chances, shots that whistled just wide, and that missed Messi penalty. But Iceland were cool throughout, their point welcomed with a huge Nordic cheer.No doubt some will now draw an unavoidable and indeed deeply unflattering parallel with Cristiano Ronaldo’s wonderful hat-trick last night, an extreme contrast with Messi’s impotence here. That struggle for tournament fluency continues. But this afternoon belonged above all to the men from the volcanic rock in the middle of the Atlantic, whose extraordinary world tour isn’t showing any sign of losing its momentum just yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941801e622c5a0340a5b1a5719b552a60f430647/0_139_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c844f6eca58b57fff00a3a6407ebf3fd","title":"croatia luka modric great expectations","story":"• Pressure on a high-quality squad to get out of the group stage• ‘We won’t give up on attacking football,’ Zlatko Dalic saysCroatia enter the World Cup on Saturday, their Golden Generation beginning what is surely a last quest towards making an impact on the greatest stage. The core of the team, Real Madrid’s Luka Modric, Barcelona’s Ivan Rakitic and Juventus’s Mario Mandzukic are in their 30s and unlikely to feature in four years’ time.The quality of the squad means there is pressure to perform but Modric believes the expectation is justified. “I think we have a very good generation of players,” he said. “We have players at big clubs, they don’t just play there, they’re the driving forces of those clubs. It is only right there are great expectations.”He said the first target for Croatia, who face Nigeria, is to get out of a tricky group that contains Argentina and Iceland, and “after that, anything is possible”.Croatia’s preparations for the tournament have been overshadowed by a court case against Zdravko Mamic, one of the most influential figures in Croatian football, and involving Modric and the Liverpool centre-back Dejan Lovren. Last week Mamic, who denies all charges, was sentenced to six and a half years in jail after being found guilty on a set of charges that included making illegal personal profits on player transfers from Dinamo Zagreb.Modric has been charged with perjury in the Mamic case and Lovren is being investigated for giving a false testimony. The Real Madrid playmaker grew irritable when asked about the case on Friday. “Nothing smarter to ask? It’s a World Cup, it’s not about other things. How long did you prepare for asking this kind of question?” Modric said, before the moderator moved the discussion on to the next question. Lovren has previously refused to comment.Zlatko Dalic promised an uncompromising attacking start by Croatia. “We have our own style,” the manager said. “We are not going to give up on tactical, attacking football. We will adjust to the young team of Nigeria, particularly when they are on the attack, but I fully believe in my players and I’m not going to impede their guile, their creativity and their technique.”Nigeria have also had their share of problems at World Cups, including internal rifts and striking players but their captain, Mikel John Obi, said on Friday this squad are more united than ever before.“We don’t have any problems about money. Everything is sorted. There’s no issues at all in the camp. The camp is fine, the boys are happy, we’re ready to go,” he said.Nigeria are one of the youngest sides at the World Cup, and while Croatia go into the game as firm favourites, Nigeria could cause problems with their energy and enthusiasm.The match will take place at a new 35,000-seat stadium in Kaliningrad, an isolated Russian exclave bordering Poland and Lithuania and best known for hosting nuclear missiles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96a7fd70f1fd45ab89276077c9aee73b216d171/0_108_4489_2693/master/4489.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1607b73216ceacb899c9eee1df24404","title":"france australia world cup 2018 match report","story":"This was a game the like of which the World Cup has not quite seen ever before. A culture clash between the underwhelming French and the resilient Australians was an unyielding affair on the pitch – so much, so expected - but the most influential component, chip of the match if you will, was off-pitch technology. The goals in this narrow French win came courtesy of a VAR-assisted penalty and a GLT-awarded matchwinner.It was an eventful afternoon for the full-kit video referees, who assisted the Uruguayan official in the middle of it all, Andrés Cunha, in exemplary fashion. Critics of technology might have their reservations but in real time, in the Kazan Arena, the reactions were quick, decisive and correct. It all seemed a world away from Frank Lampard’s infamous over-the-line-yet-not given goal in South Africa 2010 as Paul Pogba was able to pause with his arms outstretched in vague uncertainty for just a few seconds before the signal came that he could celebrate his deflected shot bouncing down off the crossbar and over that white line.It proved a very welcome winner for France after a largely stodgy performance. Although this game presented itself as a challenge to Australia’s powers of containment, it soon turned into a test of character for Les Bleus. Didier Deschamps’ team is constructed around the vigour of youth, with seven of the starting XI playing in a World Cup finals for the first time, and Australia were in no mood to stand aside and allow too many dashing runs go unchecked. Bert van Marwijk had called for guts and got gallons of it.France’s bright start offered a flash of what Deschamps had in mind by teaming up Kylian Mbappé, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembélé up front. Mat Ryan had to deal with three shots on target in the opening five minutes. The best of them came as Mbappé seared in from the right and instinctively slammed in a fierce strike. The 19-year-old broke into a sweet smile as if to suggest this World Cup lark was just up his street.Olés from the banks of gold-shirted Aussies when there team managed to weave a handful of passes together suggested they were happy enough avoiding the perils of doing a Saudi Arabia. But it soon became apparent their team were both solidly structured and highly motivated enough to execute a plan that would cause significant problems for France. “Nobody expected we could play like this against France,” noted Van Marwijk. “In a lot of moments they didn’t know what to do any more.” Food for thought for France, whose front three struggled to click and whose midfield sat too deep to orchestrate the game.In the 17th minute Australia’s optimism levels soared as they forged a threatening opening. Set pieces were always going to be a significant part of the plan and the classy Aaron Mooy’s lofted free-kick unnerved France, Mathew Leckie glanced on and Corentin Tolisso stabbed out an unconvincing foot. The ball ricocheted, fizzing low towards the bottom corner. Hugo Lloris had to react sharply to palm the ball behind the near post.Australia were firm in the tackle, quick on the chase, organised, direct. Goalless at half-time, the Australians whooped. France looked hassled, a bit antsy, needing some inspiration. For all the excitement about their talent pool, they looked less than the sum of their parts.The game tilted with a sudden dramatic twist. France’s midfield pulled itself together to win the ball and release Griezmann on the run, for once finding the space for a forward sprint. Joshua Risdon ed in and tripped Griezmann. Referee Cunha, unmoved to begin with, got the nod to consult the pitchside replays and returned to the pitch with two gestures: first the television sign, then the penalty. Griezmann slotted the opening goal past Ryan although he was later substituted unhappily.Australia launched back and within four minutes had a penalty of their own. Bizarrely, Samuel Umtiti jumped at Mooy’s cross, arm raised, eyes closed, apparently not in the zone to deal with it at all. The ball grazed his fist. This time there was no need for VAR. Cunha saw it and gave it. No debate, no doubt. Mile Jedinak sent Lloris the wrong way.France retook the lead with another dash of theatrical flourish. The build up was born of beautifully deft, quick passing. Paul Pogba was at the heart of it, exchanging moves with Mbappé and Olivier Giroud before his shot nicked off Aziz Behich and looped over Ryan, against the crossbar, and in. Not in by much, mind, but enough for the Goal Line Technology buzzer to inform Cunha to award the goal.For France, it was enough, but they will be looking to up their game. Australia huddled in the centre circle at the end of it all. They had given their all but know they can take positives forward.“I am proud and disappointed,” said van Marwijk. “I had questions if I was afraid to lose 5-0, but everyone can see this is a different team. One of the most positive things is that we showed guts and that we could be ourselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c69bccb9d68f8f5fec013fa22ab1971b74b234aa/322_254_1499_899/master/1499.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee7dd44547b2e87aa2d20cc88193090b","title":"gareth southgate england world cup 2018","story":"Even while he was still playing Southgate sensed he would be more successful as a manager and, after an impressive England tenure so far, now comes the acid testGareth Southgate always felt he had something still to achieve. He sensed it long before his playing career had been curtailed, reconciling himself with the reality that a move to one of the Premier League’s elite clubs had gone, but never that his chance to scale the pinnacle of the sport would elude him. “Over the last few years I have felt too often that I may have to wait for a career in management to have a shot at fulfilment,” he had conceded. “A strange thought for a man still unsure about what he wants to do after his playing days are over.”The conclusion had been drawn towards the end of Woody and Nord, the book written with his close friend and former teammate in Crystal Palace’s youth team Andy Woodman in 2003, when he still had three years of a stint at Middlesbrough to run. It proved prophetic and, if the 47-year-old rather stumbled into his current role, there has been clarity to his approach to the job. In the Volgograd Arena on Monday, when Southgate’s England stare down Tunisia in their opening Group G fixture, that opportunity to realise a long-held aspiration will finally be his.This will be a very different test of Southgate’s credentials. Everything he has done over his England tenure has been impressive. Those who feared he was merely a yes man, the Football Association’s safest option given the post-Euro 2016 meltdown and Sam Allardyce’s stunted spell, have been reassured by the strength of so much of his decision-making.The omissions of Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere for Russia felt bold calls but were justifiable. There has been no repeat of Fabio Capello’s wild selection in 2010, and no attempt to find short-term fixes, with his focus geared towards progression. Another who missed out, Alfie Mawson, may have a role in the long term, so there was also a phone call to the Swansea City defender to explain this was a tournament too soon.Even the manner in which he dealt with Raheem Sterling’s tardy arrival at St George’s Park was impressive. There was a firm but calmly delivered reminder that such behaviour is unacceptable, a glimpse of his authoritative side. Once the forward was caught in a media storm over the tattoo of a rifle on his calf, Southgate recognised the need to be supportive. His initial intention to leave out Sterling against Nigeria was shelved. The player, potentially vulnerable, had suffered enough. This was a time to unite.The relaxed atmosphere in which the team have undergone preparations has helped disperse anxiety which might have gripped the third-youngest squad England have dispatched to the finals. Players have spoken consistently of his calmness. “His mindset rubs off on the group,” said Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who had played under Southgate for the under-21s. “He’s good at managing players off the pitch because he has been one of us, at club and England levels. He understands us.” But, if all that equates to winning the phoney war, the early indications are promising as to how he will attack what happens next.Southgate was capped 57 times over an international career that encompassed spells, sometimes very brief, under six managers, and has taken elements from each. Where he learned on the hoof having been thrust into the job at Boro – he considers the 12th- and 13th-place finishes in the top flight in his first two years as his “biggest achievement” – he has been more strategic with the national setup. Older and wiser, he had a plan.His team were pragmatic and efficient through qualification but, once passage to the finals had been secured, he was insistent, even with time and opportunities relatively limited, the approach needed to shift. “I feel we need to expand our game to succeed at the highest level,” he had offered in his book when surveying his England career under Sven-Göran Eriksson. Yet again, he has been true to that philosophy.The side he sends out in Volgograd will be attack-minded and bold, youthful and brimming with energy. Southgate preaches the possession-based football which, he believes, allows sides to flourish in tournaments particularly in oppressive heat. England are far from the finished article but should be better placed to cope. There will be no stifling of intent, no sudden cramping up with caution and no awkward shoehorning of players into his lineup. He has selected a squad comfortable with the style of play demanded, as Chris Smalling discovered to his cost.The choice of three at the back delivered a solid platform from which a team without a stellar playmaker can tap into the qualities they do possess. If there were concerns the manager’s forte might not be on the training pitch then he hired shrewdly in Steve Holland, his right-hand man with the under-21s, whose departure constituted a significant loss to Chelsea. Holland worked with Antonio Conte’s back three in their title-winning season. Southgate played it under Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle with England. They can switch from 3-5-2 to 3-4-3, with flexibility an asset.“The top managers Steve’s worked with – people like José Mourinho, Antonio Conte – he can take all that knowledge and bring it to us,” added Loftus-Cheek. “Steve does a lot more of the training, while Gareth tends to do more of the tactical stuff. They work so well together.”That ability to adapt in games will prove the acid test of Southgate’s leadership, particularly if England are struggling, but there is no reason to suppose Southgate will not rise to that task. He is strong-willed, with a clear vision of England’s future, a philosophy that struck a chord with the FA. He fought to make his playing career a success having been rejected by Southampton at 13 and almost released by Palace, before earning the respect of senior professionals in the “bear pit” that was the south London club’s Mitcham training ground. It yielded League Cups with Aston Villa and Boro, and a First Division title at Palace, but the possibility to achieve real fulfilment remains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec0279e77d1ae32883092894a0c96cdbff0dc934/0_54_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=430cd2946b86ccded3757cc159823b71","title":"nigeria bryan idowu interview racism russia world cup","story":"The Russian-born defender talks about being chased by skinheads while growing up in St Petersburg but says the country has changed and the majority will be ‘welcoming, positive and fun’The first time Bryan Idowu heard monkey chants aimed his way inside a Russian stadium, he faced the offenders head on and gestured for them to turn up the volume. “After that they stopped, because they knew,” he says. “For me it’s no problem, it’s just noise and doesn’t bother me. I’ve never taken it personally.”That was one of two such occurrences – a tiny fraction, he stresses, of the 120 or so league games he has played – in his career and if his stance seems surprisingly relaxed in this case it is, at least, worth listening to what the Amkar Perm defender has to say. Idowu will represent Nigeria at the World Cup but was born and raised in St Petersburg, spending all bar a few early years of his life in Russia. It gives him a perspective available to very few he has experienced some of the less pleasant aspects of life as a young black man in a society struggling to adapt to the post-Soviet space but knows the other side of things, too. He believes the country has changed significantly since the days in the early 2000s when his parents would warn him not to stray far beyond their neighbourhood, fearful of the skinheads notorious for carrying out racist attacks.“Then, at some point around 2004 or 2005, they were gone” – he clicks his fingers – “and I started walking around freely, became more involved with my teammates after practice, all that kind of stuff.”His experience suggests efforts to counteract ultranationalism in his home city – which, to give one example, manifested itself horrifically when an African student was stabbed to death in 2005 – bore some fruit. At that point Idowu was in his early teens, taking his nascent steps in Zenit St Petersburg’s Smena academy. It was, he emphasises repeatedly, a happy childhood despite the restrictions that for a time became ingrained.“I was surrounded by good, positive people all the time: a good group of guys at school, the neighbours who I played football with on the streets, great people. I just felt like I fitted in. Of course I was black and Russian, so sometimes I’d see people looking at me as I walked past because back then it was something different for them. But I have always felt at home in Russia everyone has been very welcoming to me.”The football pitch was an especially secure place for Idowu but so was school he was a straight-A student and remembers huffily muttering: “What the hell? I used to be the only one!” to himself when a similarly able boy joined his class. “We had a bit of a feud, I was competitive about it,” he continues. “I did all my assignments and was very good at reading … how do you call them in English? … stikhi.” The word he is looking for is “poems” and the stumble, in such a fluent speaker, comes out of the blue it is a reminder of the different cultures he sits astride and as a youngster the differences were even more pronounced. Idowu was born to a Nigerian father and half-Russian, half-Nigerian mother, who met at university in St Petersburg. They relocated to Owerri state, in Nigeria, when he was three and upon moving back to St Petersburg at the age of six it took time to acclimatise. He needed a translator in his school lessons at first, English and Ibo having filled his ears during that time away, but six months later he “knew Russian like I’d been speaking it all my life”.It was around then that he started training at Smena, working his way up as far as the Zenit Under-18s via stints as a ballboy for the Andrey Arshavin-inspired senior team that would win the 2008 Uefa Cup. Taking notes from those players was “a crazy experience” but Idowu was never given a chance to follow them. Here the race issue rears up again. “Originally people would say to me: ‘Oh, you’re going to be the first black guy to play for Zenit,’” he says. “But when I got to the age of about 15, some people started telling me it would be hard to get into the first team because of my race.”Idowu, who was 26 last month, emphasises that he will probably never know why, in his words, “I didn’t make it but didn’t get rejected either” at Zenit, seeing most of his friends progress from the youth setup to the second team while nobody in the coaching staff offered any explanation for his stasis. Perhaps he was simply not good enough at the time but he has fears it might have been difficult to pick him in defiance of the far-right views of Zenit ultras group Landscrona – who coined the phrase “There is no black in Zenit’s colours” and famously wrote a letter asking them not to sign black and gay players in December 2012, two years after Idowu had departed – and have been such a long-standing, unpleasant presence around the club.“I think that’s part of it for sure,” he says. “But the people who work there don’t say anything so we won’t know whether they listen to the fans or not. They shouldn’t pick black players just to show they aren’t racist or something, but they should select whoever will perform well for the team and help them win trophies. If it’s a black person then no problem.”Instead he moved to Perm, on the fringes of the Urals, joining a traditionally mid-ranking Amkar team in which he has become a fixture. This season he has shone in a relegation battle and the expectation is that, after the World Cup, he will move back up the ladder, especially as Amkar’s future is up in the air because of financial difficulties.A number of bigger clubs in Russia and Turkey have been watching closely and perhaps heads will be turned elsewhere if he starts at left-back for the Super Eagles this month. A call from Russia – and his old manager at Amkar, Stanislav Cherchesov – never came and he committed to Nigeria last year, having originally stalled after consultation with his club, who were reluctant to give up his domestic-player status.His Nigeria debut came against Argentina last November in the Russian city of Krasnodar. He scored nine minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute and describes the “whole rollercoaster of emotions” that consumed him, which gave way to genuine gratification afterwards when he discovered that the reaction in Russia to his achievement was overwhelmingly positive.Now he hopes for similarly affirmative vibes throughout a tournament whose buildup has not exactly been a byword for hope and inclusion. Russia’s rap sheet for racism and hooliganism has, for good reason, informed people’s perceptions but he believes the kind of idiotic behaviour he was twice subjected to from those terraces is far from the norm and generally a question of education.“Russia has some stupid people, that’s for sure,” he says. “But some of them don’t even define themselves as racist, and don’t think they can be because they were never part of things that happened in other countries’ cultural history, like the slavery of black people. So for them it’s different: they will say something as a joke and won’t understand it is racist. They won’t realise what they are doing at the time. You can find good and bad people everywhere: you can’t say from a few people’s actions that a whole country is racist. You’ll mainly find people who agree it is not right and are welcoming, positive and fun.“I think the World Cup will help the friendships between Russia and other countries. It will be an opportunity to be closer and come together. Not many Russians get to travel widely but many of them are very open-minded and love Europe. It’s going to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for them, a very positive thing to welcome all those nations, and I think the country will grow afterwards.”Idowu is not denying anyone else’s experience he is simply recounting his own. On 26 June Nigeria will face Argentina again, this time in the city of his birth and for higher stakes. It will be another emotive step in a career he had hardly envisaged turning out like this and perhaps, given the obstacles he has made light of, one tinged with a little vindication too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d49c783c3adf2b149d761ab4d687bdd8d70cd1f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d1229c1950bd97a8333199fcddceabb","title":"world cup needs iconography lionel messi lifting trophy","story":"The tournament used to make its own stars but is now overdue an outstanding, trophy-winning inidual performanceMoscow is a fascinating place to enter for the first time, its fringes marked by an endless scroll of huge stickle-brick buildings and gaudy roadside shopping complexes. Heading in from this angle, before the austere majesty of the city centre, it seems the chief beneficiary of Russia’s great opening out was that well-known US imperialist Colonel Sanders, who can be seen grinning down like Lenin’s crispy-fried southern gentleman cousin from his endless lighted placards, impassive, stoical and oddly comforting.But then, like many other nations, Russia does love an icon. Look around the early days of this World Cup and certain faces just keep looming up in wide-screen scale. Statues of the actual, non-chicken Lenin can be found at 82 Moscow locations, including the Luzhniki Stadium, where the Father of the Revolution towers above stalls for Qatar Air and Chinese yoghurt, eyes turned towards the skyline with a look of fearless destiny, mixed with a little mild exasperation.To the north of the city the entrance to the Spartak Stadium is guarded by a 25-metre effigy of Spartacus himself, sword drawn in defence of the pitch where Lionel Messi and Argentina will play Iceland on Saturday afternoon. Meanwhile, turn on your TV to catch the previews and the chances are the visage of that other great anti-hero José Mourinho will come leaping out of the screen in his role as pundit for Russia Today.Mourinho was a star of the opening‑day coverage, windswept on a balcony above Red Square, bathed in wondrous evening sunlight, looking like the man who sold the world. At one point there was an embarrassment of televisual riches as we cut from José straight to Mark Bosnich, dressed in an open collar shirt with hair swept back, resembling a glamorous society helicopter‑salesman who lost it all in a ponzi scheme and is now living in a Reno motel.Mourinho is billed as a “co-host” on RT. He will not like that. And to be fair it is hard to think of anyone less suited to a career as a TV presenter. But Mourinho’s lip-curling manner, his refusal to be impressed by anything at all, is quite refreshing, as is his total conviction that, whatever else might be going on, the real story here is called José Mourinho and is sneering pityingly at Peter Schmeichel on a Moscow rooftop.Except, of course, it is not. Messi may be about to turn 31, with 124 caps on the clock, but he remains the most significant presence at this World Cup, albeit not without a little nuance. At the pre-match press conference in Moscow there was the usual hushed tribute of his all-time qualities but there is something a bit different about Leo in Moscow.Travel to any football event over the last decade and Messi comes at you from every angle, decorating the street stalls, the hoardings and TV stings. So far in Russia the greatest player of the modern age has been present in dilute form. In part this is perhaps commercial. Messi sells his image to Pepsi and Mastercard. The World Cup is all Visa and Coke. Plus he is more or less unavailable these days, safe within his own sealed space, a star beyond the everyday.There is something more, though, something to do with stars and Messi’s own unspooling into the legacy years. The old talk about how he needs to win a World Cup to complete the game will be trotted out again. But this is one cliche that could do with a refit. In fact the opposite is true. It is instead the World Cup that needs Messi these days.It is tempting to rail against the lure of celebrity, to yearn for new faces and underdog triumphs. In its great years the World Cup simply made its own stars. But it has not had an outstanding trophy-winning inidual performance for some time. The last obvious poster boy was Ronaldo in 2002. Zinedine Zidane was brilliant for periods in 2006. Germany were an advert for a way of playing, an industrial-scale production project. But what about the madness, the iconography, that old, insatiable Maradona-scale will to power?This is how things are now. Club football is more than ever driven by a personality cult, captivated by the preening, oddly sensual obsession with star players. Even the angles and lines of the TV coverage promote this feeling of opposed personalities, the fast‑cut to some beaming, yowling star, HD-captured, wondrously groomed, decked in flattering muscle‑tight nylon.The Messi-Ronaldo industrial complex has fed on this, has thrown every unit of its brilliance into driving European club football on to its current state of supremacy. It has been thrilling to watch. But the World Cup needs a taste now, needs to align itself with those currents of power, a tournament that craves the defining image of Argentina’s No10 – or indeed Cristiano Ronaldo or Neymar – lifting the trophy.The question remains: has it missed the boat? Ronaldo is 33 now and Portugal are not Real Madrid. Neymar could yet apply the full range of his princely powers and use this tournament as a springboard for his own succession plans. But Messi would be the real catch.This grandfatherly old juggernaut would be defibrillated at a stroke by a touch of his genius, would feed off that image, Leo with the great, golden Blatter-head cradled aloft. Odd as it might sound, the question is whether he really needs it in return – or at least how much and how desperately."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c63c862d79487877a7e8582581cb847aef56e69c/0_18_3158_1894/master/3158.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a7ea80061678b98bca63ad0dc27a446","title":"argentina v iceland world cup 2018 live","story":"Lionel Messi had a penalty saved as the Iceland fairytale continued with a draw against Argentina on their World Cup debutThat’s it for today’s blog.

Bye!“Watched the game from Sweden,” says Alistair Scrutton. “My incredulous 8-year-old son Leo comments about Messi’s performance: ‘I’ve seen all these YouTube videos. Are they fake?’”Don’t you mean, ‘My incredulous 8-year-old son Cristiano’?The next match today is Peru v Denmark in Group C. It begins in 50 minutes, and Barry Glendenning has just assumed the position.“WELL DONE ICELAND!!!!” says Niall Mullen. “Now let’s never see each other again.”“Tomorrow is Iceland’s Independence Day,” says Kári Tulinius. “The night before is traditionally a party night. Reykjavík is going to be a giant outdoor party until the wee hours of Monday morning. The whole of Iceland will be.”Ach, sod impartiality: WELL DONE ALL OF YOU, ICELAND I LOVE YOU.Har, har VAR (part 3) On reflection, the penalty that was given was very dodgy – Meza dragged his foot against the defender to initiate contact, so that could well have been overturned. It should certainly have been reviewed by the referee.I’m struggling to understand how the decision to fast-track an inadequately trialled system into the rarefied atmosphere of the world’s biggest tournament could turn into a shambles so soon.Har, har VAR (part 2) After the earlier mistake in the FranceAustralia game, there was another hot mess in the 77th minute of this match when Cristian Pavon seemed to be fouled in the area. Whether the no-penalty decision should have been overturned is debatable, but it should certainly have been looked at.I’d love to stop and chat, but I’m off to get the next flight to Reykjavik. But seriously, what a night out that will be. Nobody will be toasted more than Alfred Finnbogason, who scored the equaliser, and Hannes Thór Halldrsson, who saved a penalty from Lionel Messi in the second half. As everyone knows, he’s a film director in his spare time. Turns out he’s a scriptwriter as well.Messi’s free-kick hits the wall, and that’s the last kick of the game! Iceland have drawn with Argentina in their first World Cup match!90+5 min Messi is fouled 30 yards from goal. This might be the last kick of the game. How’s that script looking?90+4 min Iceland are hanging on desperately now.90+3 min Messi teases the ball onto his right foot in the area, only to splatter a shot wide of the near post. That was another decent chance.91 min “The online debate on Messi vs Ronaldo,” says Matt Kershaw, “has become an absolute godsend to anyone wanting to explain the concept of confirmation bias.”Yeah but he is better isn’t he.90 min There will be five minutes of added fun. 89 min Finnbogason is replaced by Sigurdarson.88 min Mascherano’s long-range shot is comfortably held by Halldorsson, who throws the ball out of play so that’s Finnbogason can be treated for cramp. Argentina, a team with a proud history of sportsmanship, complain to the referee.87 min Halldorsson makes another fine save! Pavon’s inswinging cross from the left wing beat everyone at the near post and was bouncing towards the far corner when the unsighted Halldorsson flew to his left to push it away. That’s a brilliant stop.85 min Iceland have given up the pretence of attacking. All they want is a 1-1 draw, and quite right too. In the context of World Cup history it would be a staggering result.84 min Iceland don’t look particularly tired, despite the physical and mental demands of defending for such long periods. Argentina make their final change, with Gonzalo Higuain replacing the man whose performance put the ‘meh’ in ‘Meza’.83 min “Wow...Pavon took a e and Cristiano’s was a penalty?” sniffs Gokul Kannan. “Oh please. Ronaldo made the most of the contact and Pavon couldn’t sell it?? What is this now: salesman of the year?”Hahaha, that’s my favourite email of the World Cup so far. I agree, though, it’s weird they didn’t go to VAR. The whole thing is a premature mess. It’ll work eventually but it’s not ready yet.82 min Messi receives the ball on the edge of the D and shapes a beautiful, trademark curler just wide of the left post with Halldorsson beaten.80 min “In the airport on Madeira,” says Charles Antaki, “the Ronaldo bust has developed an extra inch of leer.”Is it now stroking its chin as well? 79 min A lofted pass into the box is brought down beautifully by the flying Messi, who is about to rattle a shot at goal from the left edge of the six-yard box when Saevarsson sneaks round to make a vital interception.77 min Pavon goes down in the area after a challenge from Saevarsson. The referee berates him for simulation but there was definitely contact. Whether the contact was sufficient for a penalty, I’m not sure, but it was surely enough to merit a VAR review. Instead, play carries on as normal.76 min Argentina make another change: the anonymous Angel Di Maria is replaced by Cristian Pavon. And Iceland bring on Ari Freyr Skulason for the weary Aron Gunnarsson.75 min Banega has made a difference since coming on, with much greater attacking intent and quality than Biglia. But Iceland are still defending exceedingly well.74 min  “That penalty,” says Maria Bruschi, “is proof positive that Messi can no longer be compared to CR7!!”Oh lord, please don’t start that again. I still haven’t got through all the abusive emails from last night.73 min Meza is fouled 28 yards from goal, to the right of centre. Messi curls it into the wall.72 min Banega’s wobbling long-range shot is comfortably held by Halldorsson. Argentina are pressing constantly but they will fear a late sting.70 min Iceland can’t get out. It’s all Argentina now – but they are still struggling to find an eye in the Icelandic needle. The two best chances have come from a mis-hit shot and a nothing cross.66 min Messi wafts a 30-yard free kick high over the bar.65 min Just before the penalty, Iceland brought on Gislason for the injured Johann Gudmundsson.64 min It was a poor penalty from Messi, placed at saveable height to his left, and Halldorsson flew across goal to palm it away! This Iceland team are ridiculous.63 min A cross is dumped into the box, where Meza goes down after a collision with Magnusson. I’m not absolutely sure it was a penalty but the referee had no doubts and it certainly wasn’t something that should have been overturned by VAR.62 min Iceland break dangerously, only for the usually precise Gylfi Sigurdsson to overhit a through ball to Finnbogason. With the correct weight he would have been clear on goal.59 min The contrast in styles between these two teams is fascinating. It makes chalk and cheese seem like siblings in comparison. Messi finds Banega, whose shot from the edge of the area is desperately blocked by the sliding Ragnar Sigurdsson. The human spirit is strong in these ones.58 min “Hi Rob,” says David Wall. “Niall Mullen is wrong, those were the tactics that Australia adopted earlier on (I don’t even remember their striker ever being mentioned in commentary). They made no effort at all to do anything other than stopping France doing anything constructive (and they did it very well). Iceland on the other hand are belting forward quickly and in numbers when they do win the ball. That’s a tactic to try to win a game against opponents who keep the ball better than you. Australia’s was a tactic to try not to lose. Both are perfectly respectable, but they are different.”There’s only one way to settle this. Gentlemen, prepare your chalkboards.55 min Messi is playing pretty deep at times, almost like an old-fashioned playmaker rather than a No10. He accepts the ball in that deep position, surges forward and beats three players in a space the size of a phonebox. Eventually somebody gets a foot in on the edge of the area and the ball deflects to Aguero, whose shot is blocked at the expense of corner. Moments later, a fierce shot from Aguero is again blocked.54 min Argentina make their first substitution, with the progressive Ever Banega replacing Lucas Biglia.53 min “You’re wrong about Caballero,” says Zafar Sobhan. “He did really well with both those saves, and was just unlucky with the first one.”52 min A good spell for Iceland. Gylfi Sigurdsson, on the left of the box, whacks a cross that hits Otamendi right in the personal space and goes behind for a corner.Sigurdsson’s corner is punched away by Caballero and tossed back into the box, where it seems to hit the hand of an Argentina defender. Ah, in fact, it was headed onto the hand of Salvio from close range, which is why a penalty wasn’t given.50 min Croatia meet Nigeria in the other Group D match tonight, and you can read all about it here.49 min Bjarnason’s dangerous cross drifts just over the head of Finnbogason on the six-yard line. I think he’d have been given offside had he touched it though.48 min The pattern of the second half is as expected, with loads of Argentinian possession. Henrik Larsson, a pundit on ITV, made a good point that Argentina’s build-up play has been far too slow. Every now and then Messi has put a rocket up their derriere but that’s about it. Meanwhile, Otamendi heads Di Maria’s outswinging corner over the bar from 12 yards. That was a decent if tough opportunity.47 min “I know this was yesterday,” begins Matt Emerson, “to continue the best games of the Group stages riff, how about Senegal 3-3 Uruguay in 2002? Senegal lead 3-0 with a clearly offside goal and a dodgy penalty. Uruguay get back to 3-3 with their own awful pen and need another goal to go through. Forlan missed a one-on-one at 3-2 and Morales heads wide in injury time. One of the best games I’ve ever seen and one I regularly bore people about...”Yes, great shout - that was a deranged classic. Morales’s miss was bizarre. I still think Argentina 2-1 France in 1978 is my favourite, because the stakes and quality were so high.46 min Peep peep! Argentina begin the second half.42 min Argentina appeal again for a penalty when Salvio’s low cross hits the hand of the falling Sigurdsson. He knew nothing about it, and VAR supports the original decision. Glenn Hoddle makes the excellent point that VAR is having an impact on the concentration levels of players."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cb837d643c65f99a7ca4ce091134066fe58601c/0_184_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b278fdb8ddad6ba7e952c01630224505","title":"france v australia world cup 2018 live","story":"Up next for Australia is an encounter with Denmark they cannot afford to lose.

Perhaps if he’d done it as a rap?” That would have been outstanding.Steve Waterhouse, not so much. “France have brilliant players but, as per two years ago, are tactically inept... which must lie with Deschamps.” I’m sure there’ll be plenty of  column inches on that subject in the coming days.Finally! I found a happy camper, Dave Tole. “This is the way it should be, France start slow, creep through then improve and win the tournament and I clean up in the work sweep. What team ever started like a house on fire and carried that through to the final?”Apologies for any correspondence I’ve missed. There was definitely some about Mark Lawrenson I couldn’t comment on because I’m not watching the BBC feed. Which sounds like it might be a blessing in disguise. On a different note: “My wife,” that’s Scott Bassett’s wife, “does not give a flying eff about this whole mess, immediately began singing this for the Australia goal. Go on, sing along. you know you want to.... and plenty of you are suggesting it might not have been a pen. Matthew Nelson: “A) He incontrovertibly gets the slightest touch on the ball and B) He doesn’t clearly touch Griezmann.” Replays clearly show B is wrong, as for A, I can’t tell either way, certainly not enough to declare it incontrovertible. “Going to be loads of penalties if the defender can’t get the ball then the man (even though the touch here was slight) on follow through,” writes David Seare. Which is one of the issues with VAR - should the on-field referee be overruled when there remains debate over the challenge?Building on that, Hugh Molloy writes: “I’m pro VAR but that’s a shocker. Ref watches several hard to tell replays on a sun blasted monitor that suggests a penalty, gives it, then the crowd sees the money shot slow mo replay that shows a (slight but significant) touch therefore meaning not a certain penalty.”Plenty of correspondence coming in from disgruntled viewers upset at the behaviour of Lucas Hernandez. Here’s a couple of choice cuts to give you a flavour.“The dramatics really took away from what was otherwise an exciting match,” emails Clare Lawrence. While Burt Bosma writes: “If I read correctly, the referees can now review incidents at half time and after the game. If that’s true, Hernandez should at the least be yellow carded for his constant simulation, ing on the ground and claiming he has been struck in the head when the replays show he has merely had normal body on body contact. If nothing happens, the new rule is pointless.”Australian skipper Mile Jedinak: “We knew we had to be right at it from the start, maintain that discipline and focus. We got ourselves back in the game, felt ok, but they got that goal... We’re disappointed. We just didn’t have that luck. That’s football, we have to take the positives out of today and move on... If we maintain that form and discipline, structure, concentration throughout, let’s see where it gets us. I can’t fault the boys tonight.”“The French have been slightly underwhelming but Australia seem to be a lot more organised than I was expecting,” emails Phil Withall. “They seem to have adopted an attitude of ‘I know who you are but I know who I am’ and I’m liking it very much.” They have transitioned from a Postecoglou side to a Van Marwijk side very quickly.Australian coach Bert van Marwijk: “I’m disappointed because I think we deserved a point. We can be proud of the way we played against one of the best teams in the world. Just before the 2-1 Juric could make the situation and there’s a tackle on him where they get a yellow card and the chance is gone.”What did we learn?All the pre-tournament fears about France were laid bare. Masses of quality but little cohesion and plenty of work for Deschamps to figure out the right formula for tougher tasks. The use of Griezmann in particular must be of concern. Arguably France’s best player was peripheral before he was substituted.Australia proved they are not the pushovers some expected. They offered little in attack but they ran their socks off for 90 minutes and defended with conviction. Sainsbury and Ryan were outstanding at the back while Mooy and Jedinak put in heroic shifts in midfield. Grounds for optimism against Denmark and Peru.That is it. Far from vintage from France but they leave Kazan with three valuable points. Australia battled resolutely throughout but depart empty-handed.90+5 min: Needless foul on Pogba on halfway. That could be it for Australia.90+4 min: The more the game has stretched the more it has played into Kante’s hands. He’s been superb second half. He can’t interrupt Risdon’s excellent dash down the right though but the fullback’s cross is weak and cleared. Mooy picks up the scraps, feeds the ball out to the left but the eventual cross doesn’t find a gold shirt until it falls to Arzani outside the box but his shot is blocked. 90+3 min: Fekir has done well since he came on, offering France more in front of Australia’s defence than Dembele did trying to get in behind. He’s been a nuisance down the right hand side.90+1 min: It will be longer than five minutes because Hernandez is milking an ‘injury’, not for the first time today. 90 min: France should have sealed the result. Kante does superbly to break up play and then set Mbappe away down the left, he does well to outpace Ryan and recycle possession but Fekir and Pogba make a mess of what could have been a near open goal.Five minutes of stoppage time to be played. 88 min: Australia are expending so much energy defending they have nothing in attack when they clear. France looking in control, finally, after a difficult day.86 min: Since that second France goal Australia have been unable to wrestle any momentum in their favour. It’s not been helped by some cheap turnovers coming out of defence. The latest, by Behich, results in the fullback receiving a yellow card for his failed recovery efforts.84 min: Final substitution for Australia and it’s the wunderkind Arzani, making his competitive debut in place of Kruse.Out of nothing Pogba does it for France! Finally some interplay in midfield creates an opportunity with the Manchester United man striding into the box and lifting an improvised toe-poke volley above Ryan and in off the crossbar. The ball only just crossed the line but it was swiftly confirmed by technology. Heartbreak for Australia, relief for the big guns.80 min: Australia struggling to get numbers forward in attack when they clear their lines now. This could turn into ten minutes of attack versus defence.77 min: Dear me, this is descending into an ugly old shambles. Neither side can string more than a couple of passes together. Still, Australia’s commitment cannot be questioned, especially in midfield where Mooy and Jedinak - now joined by Irvine - are snapping into Pogba and Kante at every opportunity. Final change for France as Matuidi comes on for Tolisso.75 min: Tiredness starting to creep in now with spaces opening in midfield where previously there was congestion. This is where France would look to Pogba to stamp his authority on proceedings. He’ll have to wait for a while though while Tolisso receives a yellow card for cynically hauling down Juric who was breaking dangerously from midfield.74 min: It’s been a compelling contest but awfully scrappy, full of misplaced passes and rushed possession. The few moments of time on the ball France have enjoyed have displayed a lack of understanding amongst teammates, the latest example being Fekir failing to recognise Giroud’s movement.72 min: France earn a corner that ends with Pavard blasting extravagantly high from outside the box. Australia clear their lines and slow the game down high up the field on their left.71 min: More substitution interruption. This time it’s Irvine for Rogic for Australia. That will bolster Van Marwijk’s midfield while his side dig in for the draw.69 min: Here come the subs. Giroud and Fekir for Griezmann and Dembele. 68 min: Giroud and Fekir look to be being readied by Deschamps. Meanwhile France work the ball into Australian territory down the left, switch to the right for the cross but it’s repelled easily by the massed ranks of gold shirts.67 min: Ryan does well to rescue his defence from a sloppy backpass but he’s sharply off his line to deny Mbappe. 66 min: What have France got in this last half hour or so? Apart from the burst around their goal they’ve lacked fluency this second half. Deschamps yet to make any changes.63 min: First substitution of the night is an Australian one. Andrew Nabbout worked hard for little reward, and he’s replaced by the Socceroos’ regular number 9 Tomi Juric.62 min: Anyone remember Glenn Hysen conceding a penalty for Liverpool at Old Trafford back in the day? Umtiti’s indiscretion was like that. Well, well, well. Jedinak, Australia’s penalty-taking specialist rolls the ball calmly to Lloris’ left and the underdogs are level. Blimey! Australia go down the other end, win a free-kick that Mooy swings into the box and Umtiti inexplicably swings an arm at the ball while he fails to connect with a header.60 min: France have the bit between their teeth now and immediately break Australia’s defensive line again. Dembele doesn’t pull the trigger from a tight angle though and Australia smuggle the ball clear.59 min: For advocates of VAR that was a great illustration of how it can be used effectively. The referee missed the decision in real time and it was overturned with the minimum of fuss. Uphill task now for Australia though.Griezmann blasts the ball to the stationary Ryan’s left. France have laboured but they have a precious lead.VAR has intervened in a World Cup for the first time and it does so to prove Risdon got nothing on his challenge on Griezmann. The referee makes the charades hand gesture for TV, and then points to the spot. Risdon gets a booking too for his troubles.55 min: Massive moment! France win the turnover and attack through the middle, Pogba sends a lovely weighted pass into Griezmann, he’s through on goal but Risdon nicks it away from his toes as he’s in on Ryan. The referee waves play-on, but he’s been invited to consult VAR...53 min: Decent from Australia, down the right this time, with Risdon getting ahead of Leckie and whipping a cross in. Nabbout makes his presence felt but he can’t fashion a shooting opportunity. Good signs for Australia though that their counterattacking may pay idends as the game stretches.51 min: Almost an opening for France who shift the ball nicely from back to front but the key pass to the overlapping Hernandez is overhit by Demebele. Let-off for Australia with Risdon caught out of position.48 min: Stoppage in play while Hernandez receives treatment. The France left-back has spent his fair share of this game on the deck with replays not favouring his resilience.47 min: Nervy start to the half by Australia, the goalkeeper and both fullbacks making a bit of a horlicks of playing out from the back. France capitalise and begin probing around the box but a smart Milligan header releases the pressure.Cut to close up of Giroud lacing up his boots on the bench. Can’t imagine he’ll be sat down for long. 46 min: Second half underway. No changes by either side just yet.Ante Milicic, Australia’s assistant coach, has just been on the telly. He said words like discipline, block, energy, concentration - you get the drift. Ladies and gentleman, please return to your seats, the second half will commence shortly. The things I’d be doing if I was awake at 4am in Costa Rica...While you’re still on your half time cuppa, nip over and select your favourite all-time Australian XI. Alan Davidson did, and it rattled a few cages.“Care to take a crack at explaining why Deschamps seems to have no tactical plan for this team?” asks Adam Kline-Schoder. “Looks to me as though there is no link between the midfield and attack (maybe starting with two defensive midfielders wasn’t such a great idea?) Dembélé, Griezmann, and Mbappé can’t be bothered to do any defensive work and the passing is SO poor, Pogba’s pass that you highlighted being a prime example. I don’t consider myself a fan of Les Bleus, but I find the current level of ineptitude incredibly frustrating given the amount of talent in that squad. They should be unstoppable, really.Big shoutout to Australia, though. A very organised and hard-working defensive performance so far, with Sainsbury’s positioning, Ryan’s calmness, and Mooy’s willingness to get stuck in (in a way that I feel like I don’t usually see him do for Huddersfield) particularly impressive. Of slight concern is that they look rather toothless in attack, but that’s not a particular problem at the moment...”I think you just did my job pretty well Adam. Thanks!“France look like they just don’t enjoy playing football! No smile or willingness to show what they can do,” writes Neil Parmar. That has been the concern in the build-up to Russia for the French, does Deschamps have what it takes to extract the best from such a talented group of players? 45-minutes in and the jury is out.

Peru manager Ricardo Gareca declared Guerrero to be “very, very fit” and “really ready to play”, but has opted to leave him on the bench here.Bakary Papa Gassama is the man in the middle today. The 39-year-old Gambian has been Fifa-listed since 2007 and is a veteran of three African Cup of Nations, including the 2015 final won by Ivory Coast. Having reffed at last year’s Confederations Cup, Gassama has prior experience of using VAR and admits that, while helpful it has plenty of room for improvement. “VAR is very advantageous, because it is good for football now,” he told the BBC in an interview. “Now, we are in learning process - people have to understood that. It is just like a new job: before you understand it, it will take some time. As time goes on, with this new technology, many referees and many VARs will understand better.”Following France’s unconvincing 2-1 win over Australia, Peru take on Denmark in the second of today’s Group C matches. Despite only being in Russia after scraping past a vastly superior Republic of Ireland team in a play-off, Denmark are favourites to beat a Peru side contesting their first World Cup finals since 1982. They may have their work cut out to beat a South American side that have lost just two of their past 28 matches and brought upwards of 50,000 fans on the 4,000+ mile trip to Russia for their first World Cup adventure in 36 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90f0875a07758b1c3d6a2be2e3b233f772703c65/0_317_2979_1787/master/2979.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37bd609081b036eac0de848311558296","title":"george clinton if people dont like funk its the wrong time for them","story":"The musician, 76, on life on mars, marijuana pens and looking good in a capeMy mother gave me the discipline to follow my dreams.

They bought a campervan, a job lot of flares and enough Tupperware to last a lifetime. Mostly we’d eat spiced vegetables in some form, herbed rice and salad, with chutneys to accompany. Here, 46 years later, I’ve combined all of those elements for, in my eyes, the perfect picnic meal.For the rice 1 red onion, peeled ½ large cauliflower (about 600g)350g baby aubergines (ie, about 4 slim ones) 300g vine tomatoes, halved Rapeseed oil 1 tsp salt3 garlic cloves, unpeeled 250g basmati and wild rice (I like Tilda)400g tin chickpeas 15g fresh coriander leaves, finely choppedFor the tamarind dressing 1 tbsp tamarind paste1 ½ tbsp date syrup 1 tbsp rapeseed oil ¼ tsp ground red chilli ½ tsp ground cuminSaltFor the ‘yoghurt’ dressing100ml non-dairy yoghurtSaltHeat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4 and line two large oven trays with foil. Chop the onion from above into wedges, separate into “petals”, then arrange on one half of one tray. Break down the cauliflower into bite-sized pieces and put these on the other half of the tray.Cut the aubergines lengthways into quarters, and put them on one half of the second tray lay the tomatoes on the other half.Whisk four tablespoons of oil with a teaspoon of salt, pour this over all the vegetables, then toss with your hands to coat all the surfaces and get into the nooks and crannies. Bash the garlic cloves with the back of a knife and put on the aubergine tray, then roast the onion and cauliflower for 20-25 minutes and the aubergine, tomatoes and garlic for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, wash the rice in a sieve under the cold tap until the water runs clear, then tip into a large saucepan. Drain the chickpeas, add to the rice, then cover with plenty of cold water and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and leave to simmer for 18 minutes, or until tender. Drain into a sieve, then cover with a clean tea towel and leave for 10 minutes.Now make the dressings. In a small bowl, mix the tamarind paste, date syrup and oil with a tablespoon of water. Add the chilli, cumin and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and mix again.Put the yoghurt in a second small bowl.

My father and his mistress in front, my mother and I in the back. We were there to pick up or drop something off. My father turned to me, aged seven, and said forcefully, “If your nan or grandpa ask, Alison is your teacher and she is staying with us while she finds somewhere to live.” He’d told me, when she had come to live with us earlier in the year, that she was the housekeeper. She was 19 – 13 years younger than my father – and I’d never seen her do any housework. And I knew she wasn’t my teacher.I looked to my mother for explanation but she was turned away from me, gazing out of the window as if this were all perfectly normal, ignoring what was going on around her.My parents had not been happy for as long as I could remember. I was an only child, born in south London in 1961. By the mid-60s, we lived in Croydon and my father was a bank clerk, ambitious to escape his working-class roots. My mother worked part-time in a local factory, my grandparents helping out with me as and when needed.It was not a peaceful home. My father was quick to raise his voice if he came in from work and his tea was late or everything wasn’t just so. There was always tension in the air, with both my mother and I tiptoeing around him. He never struck me, and possibly not my mother, but he was always full of suppressed anger, with the sense that he could blow at any moment.Alison appeared, staying weekends at first, from some time in 1967. They’d met at work. I didn’t realise what was happening, the only difference for me being that I had to move out of my bedroom so she could sleep there. I lay wedged between my mother and father in their double bed on Friday and Saturday nights. My parents sleeping in the same bed at this time must have been for appearances’ sake. I vividly remember my mother going to kiss my father goodbye on the cheek one morning as she left for work. He pulled away so violently that I thought he was going to hit her.He was big on appearances, my father. He was always smart, with slicked hair and a collar and tie. He expected us to be perfect, polite and respectful to him, and well turned out so we didn’t let him down. He worked for the Midland Bank and was going to be a manager some time soon – an important role in the community in those days.By late 1968, we had moved across Surrey from Croydon to leafy Woodham – my father, Alison, my mother and I – as if we were one big happy family. He became an assistant bank manager in nearby Weybridge. My mother and Alison both had jobs and I spent my time after school and during holidays with a local family, paid to look after me.The year that followed was disturbing. My mother slept in a double bed in one bedroom. My father and I had twin beds in another. Alison was in the third bedroom. Appearances’ sake again – I never recall my father coming to bed or being there when I woke. Our family, such as it was, had never known love, words of affection or hugs, and it became a horror show as the months went by.My father and Alison were on one side, my mother and I on the other. No one seemed to speak, other than my father shouting at my mother over something or nothing, whenever she irritated or annoyed him, which was most of the time. I recall my mother and I playing a board game on the floor in the hall, the living room door shut so we could not “make a mess” in there. My mother and Alison never spoke – messages about washing and other humdrum matters were passed through me on little slips of paper.Starved of affection, I developed a mix of tics and facial grimaces and a need to be loved by someone, anyone. At school, there were two dinner ladies who watched over the children in the playground at break times. One would allow smaller children to walk either side of her underneath her large cloak. I was so desperate to do that, to have her arm around me, to be inside that cloak. One day, I plucked up the courage to ask if I could join in. “No, you’re too big.”Towards the end of 1969, my mother left. At eight years old, I did not understand how she could, but she was bullied into submission by my father. The only visible emotion I saw was when she came back to visit me. This was before a court ruled I was to spend weekdays with my father and weekends with my mother. I do not recall what happened during the visit, but I do remember walking with her afterwards to see her off on the bus at the top of the road. We waited silently, next to two chatty girls who were there to meet someone. As the bus came into sight, my mother started crying, saying to the girls that I was not old enough to cross back over the road on my own. They saw my tearful mother on to the bus – she barely turned and looked at me – before taking me across the road. At the time, I was indignant: “I can cross the road on my own!” Now I see more meaning in those tears as my mother watched me walk to my father’s and Alison’s house.As we moved into the 1970s, with my parents now orced, I spent weekdays with my father and Alison in their big detached house in Woodham and weekends with my mother in her rundown flat, eight miles away. In those days, orce laws favoured men and my mother left the marriage with little more than the clothes she was wearing.My father’s home was a cold place. I was expected to be quiet and polite to Alison. I had to kiss her goodnight, but only on her hand, which she held out imperiously night after night. They never had children and I was clearly not wanted there. They had married by this time, too – though I was not invited to the wedding or told about it. I only found out years later when I saw Alison’s cheque book with the name “Maitland” in it.I much preferred being with my mother, never knowing until much later how she went without food and heating in the week to look after me at the weekend. These were happier times and we would go the park, walk along the river and sometimes stay at my grandparents’. She would buy cream soda and sweets, and we sat eating and drinking and watching Doctor Who.My mother met Alf at work and they moved in together, a relationship that seemed to enrage my father. One night, coming back with my mother and Alf, I found all my belongings in black bin bags on the doorstep, dumped by my father, who wanted me out. But Alf didn’t want me, either, and sent me back.Years later, Alf died of cancer, and I moved in with my mother I never saw my father or Alison again. I’m told my father died of pancreatic cancer, a legacy of smoking 40 cigarettes a day, aged 64 in 2000. I don’t know if he had a happy life I suspect not. If I’m honest, I hope he didn’t. He made ours a misery for many years. I have no idea what happened to Alison.My mother found happiness, marrying Alf’s best friend Tony and helping him raise two sons before they retired to the Sussex coast. She saw me find love, too, before she died. I have been married for 36 years, and have three children – the happy family life that my mother and I never had all those years ago.Commenting on this piece?

They made you muddy, but they also – in the hardcore 10km or 10-mile versions – gave you electric shocks. You did them with team-mates, and everyone helped each other, and it was very bonding. It is more within my capabilities, but more alien to my outlook than the triathlon or the marathon – a kind of Sports Relief or Red Nose Day for grownups excessive physical exertion combined with enforced camaraderie.I went to Bristol, partly for a change of scene, partly because it was a 5km and therefore, technically, a mini-Tough Mudder. You can join in without a team, but this would involve helping strangers, which I’m fine with, but also asking strangers for help, which is about as close to my emotional boundaries as I can imagine – worse than an electric shock.The Downs were beautiful, but the infrastructure overwhelming: fizzy drinks reps and comperes shouting comical motivational slogans at the start line. There are obstacles that you couldn’t even contemplate without a partner, so I made friends with Dougie. He was a minister at a United Reform church, and his mates from Christian Aid hadn’t turned up. We set off.I was thrilled, even though I knew I’d cut a corner, and there’s a lesson in there somewhere about the mechanics of self-delusion. The hanging hoops were way too hard Everest was a rubber wall that you run up which we both managed but the pyramid was just stupid for a team of two: a sheer frictionless wall that, in principle, you would climb on your partner’s shoulders, and he would scale up and climb on yours. I can see it working if there were 15 of you, and the ones at the bottom were prepared to suffer the indignity of never making it.The obstacles are all very army-like, and Help for Heroes insignia flies high. I have nothing against the army I do have some residual suspicion of people who like to pretend they’re in the army. “This seems to be mostly about drinking,” Dougie said, referring to the free cider that awaited everyone at the end.We were both way out of our comfort zone.

However, the official files were not made public as part of the Heywood review and there have since been legal attempts to force their disclosure.Bhai Amrik Singh, the chair of the Sikh Federation in the UK, said the judgment “confirms the Heywood review was limited and will add to the evidence we have already presented to prove it was a whitewash”. Singh called on Theresa May to consider holding a public inquiry. He said the prime minister “should not listen to those paranoid about our relations with India”.The Downing Street files that the government has been ordered to declassify include one that covers UK-Indian relations between March 1984 and May 1985, and another that relates to the assassination of Indira Gandhi in October 1984 by some of her Sikh bodyguards, and Thatcher’s visit to India to attend her funeral.Labour is supporting the legal challenge and called on the government to release the files promptly. The Cabinet Office has a month to decide whether it will appeal against the ruling, and said that it was currently considering its position.Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said: “It has been a source of deep hurt to the British Sikh community for the past four years that Britain could have played a role in the terrible massacre of 1984. If the government appeals against this decision it will be a cowardly attempt to hide the truth.”The unanimous judgment by the tribunal led by Judge Shanks records that two Foreign Office officials gave evidence in the hearing, often in secret session. Owen Jenkins, a former director of the FCO’s south Asia and Afghanistan desk, unsuccessfully warned that “the release of some of the withheld documents would have damaged relations with India by showing that the UK government did not regard the activities of the Sikh extremists with sufficient concern and was ‘soft’ on them”.But in the judgment, the tribunal disagreed and the documents “tend to show how seriously the issues were take at senior levels in the UK government”.The tribunal also ruled that one other set of files, relating to intelligence assessments prepared for the joint intelligence committee had to remain secret because they were covered by the blanket freedom of information exemptions that apply to the UK’s spy agencies.

The move is another sign of young people increasingly mobilising against the UK’s scheduled departure from the EU in March next year.The NCAFC coordinated action and street protests by thousands of students against university fees in 2010 and 2011, and later actions during the Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition government against its wider higher education policies. Christie Neary, a member of the NCAFC national committee, said it was time Corbyn joined the battle to stop Brexit.“The only Brexit is a Tory Brexit – a racist attack on migrants and workers’ rights. Jeremy Corbyn knows that bankrupt hospitals, low pay and failing schools are the fault of bosses and relentless austerity, not migrants. Labour can’t afford to give any more ground to the right. It’s time Corbyn committed to the defence of free movement and workers, and that means leading the campaign to stop Brexit altogether,” Neary said.As the party stages its “Jezfest” music festival in north London on Saturday, pressure from pro-EU Labour supporters for the party to take a clearer anti-Brexit line is growing.MPs and remain activists want the party to abandon its policy of “constructive ambiguity” after Corbyn faced his biggest Commons rebellion by backbenchers last week on a motion about staying in the European Economic Area (EEA).Student organisations representing almost a million young people studying at UK universities and colleges joined forces last month to demand a “people’s vote” on any final Brexit deal as fears grow that leaving the EU will have a disastrous effect on their future prospects.The NCAFC is not formally linked to Labour, but many of its supporters are Corbyn supporters. The rebellion by Labour MPs happened after party whips ordered them to abstain over a motion that backed staying in the EEA. The Labour leadership objected partly because of concerns that membership would mean obeying free movement rules after Brexit, and also because it might make it difficult for the UK to join a customs union and therefore find a solution to the Northern Ireland border issue.Concerns that the party’s stance on Brexit is hitting its support grew on Thursday when Labour’s Janet Daby won the the Lewisham East by-election but with a severely reduced majority.

The Scot does not expect it to be easy.They will almost certainly play on Tuesday, in Murray’s first competitive match since Sam Querrey defeated him in five sets in the Wimbledon quarter-finals on 12\u0026nbspJuly last year.At the west London venue on Saturday the former world No\u0026nbsp1 and five-times Queen’s Club champion broke a long media silence to reflect on his time away and what might lie ahead. He sounded upbeat, but understandably cautious, before a final workout on an outside court.“I’m looking forward to it,” Murray said. “There are a lot of doubts, though, as well when you’ve not played for a long time. Coming back from injury you’re always second‑guessing yourself. You never know exactly when you’re going to be ready.“I got tested by my physios this morning to make sure I hadn’t stiffened up and lost any range of motion in my hip, which can happen when you’re tired and the hip’s a bit angry. That wasn’t the case.“That was all positive. I pulled up pretty well from that, so then I decided to go for it.”As for his match against Kyrgios, Murray said: “He plays extremely well on the grass. He’s got a brilliant serve and is very talented. He’s unpredictable as well. The positive is that there probably won’t be loads of long points. Points can be quite sharp with him, which is good, but it’s a very tricky match. Having missed 11 months, I’m expecting to be very nervous when I go back out there.”Murray went away from the All England Club last summer nursing a long-term injury to his left hip that forced him to withdraw from the 2017 US Open and the Brisbane Open over the new year, before having hip surgery in Melbourne on 8\u0026nbspJanuary, which forced his withdrawal from the Australian Open.He has worked hard since then to repair the physical damage and his dormant game, even getting ahead of his own timetable before encountering a setback in April.He put his name down for a hardcourt tournament in Washington in August – which he might yet play – then made a tentative commitment to appear in a grasscourt ATP250 event in Rosmalen this week, before again pulling out at the last minute. He has also signed up for another hardcourt appearance in China in September, at Shenzhen.But those dates are a long way off. Murray has much to prove to himself and an army of experts, commentators and fans before then.Against Norrie, Murray looked content but distant, ignoring the small clutch of tennis writers who were allowed to gather on the edge of an outside court to watch them hit for the first half-hour.Norrie won the first set 6-3, Murray the second 7-5 – which was enough to convince him he could at least be competitive in a best-of-three match at these Fever-Tree Championships.He now has the chance to stress-test himself in competition to be sure he can survive the rigours of best‑of‑five matches at Wimbledon, which starts on 2\u0026nbspJuly – especially as he will be unseeded and could draw one of the favourites in the first\u0026nbspround.Queen’s Club will not be easy for Murray. Last week Kyrgios defeated the French Open surprise contender Maximilian Marterer in three sets and the 2017 Queen’s Club champion Feliciano López, in the quarter-finals, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, to reach the Stuttgart semi-finals against Roger Federer.Murray has beaten the Australian in their five matches to date, most recently in the fourth round of Wimbledon on his way to winning the title for a second time in 2016. If they play here on Tuesday it will be 342 days after Murray’s last competitive match.Fourteen of the world’s top\u0026nbsp30, including the British No\u0026nbsp1, Kyle Edmund, are playing at Queen’s Club – with Kyrgios, Novak Djokovic and Murray unseeded. Djokovic plays a qualifier. Edmund drew the American Ryan Harrison, who won their only match in three tight sets of the semi‑finals in Atlanta last year.The British wildcard Dan Evans plays the French world No\u0026nbsp25, Adrian Mannarino, while Jay Clarke, who also received a wildcard, plays Querrey. The No\u0026nbsp1 seed, Marin Cilic, has a tough first opponent in Fernando Verdasco while, at the bottom of the draw, Grigor Dimitrov has drawn Damir Dzumhur, who took the world No\u0026nbsp3 Alexander Zverev to five sets in the third round of the French Open.Murray’s last-minute decision to play meant the Frenchman Julien Benneteau had to go through with his qualifying match against the Italian Simone Bolelli on Saturday morning, winning 7-6, 4-6, 7-5 had the Scot pulled out, Benneteau would have been added to the main draw."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/878ced579d6043f33fcb24149ccd707acbe9ab3c/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fd0aab16f8206f7e2056626b19d9deb","title":"england v australia second odi cricket live","story":"6th over: Australia 31-1 (Short 5, Marsh 5) Target 343 Marsh grabs one fine and Short a couple down in that direction to finish. Between times, Wood has the junior of the two men defending. It won’t be long until he tries to pop someone on the moon.5th over: Australia 28-1 (Short 3, Marsh 4) Target 343 Marsh very happy to defend Willey here until the chance arrives to drive, which is does expertly through cover for three. Short has a go! Swingmiss. This is what he does. Wait till he gets going, it’s brilliant. Can’t get off strike for the remainder of this set, mind. TMS tells me that they are going to go back onto the field and play not at St Lucia after the two-hour delay. Hmmm. 4th over: Australia 25-1 (Short 3, Marsh 1) Target 343 Shaun Marsh has walked out at number three as he did in the series opener. He’s forced by Wood to play throughout the rest of the successul over, using a bit of width from the final delivery to get off the mark behind point. Truth told, the major focus of the press box right now is what is happening in St Lucia. As I understand it: Sri Lanka walked out to play, were advised that they were going to be docked five points and walked off again. Blimey. Watch this space. Scrap that, Head is gone! Gives a a catch to midwicket. Nothing shot, taken low by Hales to his right. It is referred upstairs to mak sure it carried and it did. Wood into the book. 3rd over: Australia 20-0 (Head 15, Short 3) Target 343 Short misses a ball on his hip from Wood but gets him a leg bye. Better to Head than he was in his previous set but the left-hander is confident on the front foot. Tucks a single fine to keep the strike.2nd over: Australia 18-0 (Head 14, Short 3) Target 343 Earlier in the over it was Wood to Short, facing his first ball in ODI cricket. He sent down a wide down the legside to begin then a couple off the hip. He’s away. “What exciting times,” says Adam Gilchrist on TMS about the cap presentation before play. “He was quiet at the best of times but particularly nervous this morning.” Takes another single down that way too. So, Australia into double figures all in that general direction. Head changes that up lifting over the cordon for four more! Clever cricket, I always like an uppercut. As you already know by now, England wasted their review from the last ball. NOT OUT! Great decision from Alex Wharf the man on debut. Pitching outside leg. HAS MARK WOOD TRAPPED HEAD? Turned down but they are going upstairs. 1st over: Australia 8-0 (Head 8, Short 0) Target 343 Easy work for Head, clipping off his thigh for four first ball. With fine leg up, he can’t bowl there. That’s better, beats him next ball with a beaut of an outswinger. The left-armer found the South Australian’s edge early on at The Oval so he should be confident early on here. Urgh, he gives Head a second easy boundary from a misdirected delivery down the legside that he’s able to get a little tickle on. Good batting. Willey, not so much. Stats, stats, stats. From a very handy briefing via the very clever people at CricViz that has just dropped into my inbox. Righto. The players are back on field Travis Head is alongside D’Arcy Short, the man on debut. David Willey has the ball in his hand. PLAY! Thanks, Tim. Mighty effort from you with the much longer session than expected due to the rain. Isn’t Jos good at cricket? Plenty of oooohing and aaaahing in the press box as he did his thing. To adding a couple of extra stats to what Tim has noted below, that was the best ever ODI score at this ground, and if Australia win from here it’ll be their highest successful chase. The re-start is about ten minutes away so I’m going to grab a cup of tea. I suggest you do the same before dropping me a line (or a tweet). 50th over: England 342-8 (Buttler 91, Rashid 0) Tye bowls a near-wide, which is also short, and Buttler does phenomenally well to toe-end a cut for four. Last ball, he shovel-hooks for four more into the gap at long leg. Shame there wasn’t time for a hundred, but that is a sparkling captain’s innings. And it’s also England’s highest-ever one-day score against Australia. England are firm favourites, but there are plenty of runs in this pitch and the weather is unlikely to get in Australia’s way. Thanks for your company and correspondence, combination sports and all, and it’ll be Adam Collins to see you through.Plunkett sacrifices himself to get Buttler back on strike. That’s what old pros are for. Three balls to go.49th over: England 329-7 (Buttler 80, Plunkett 0) Willey finds his range with a tennis shot past long-off, then gets lucky with a top edge over Paine’s head. And then he perishes. But that gives the strike to Buttler, who cashes in with a cracking four through midwicket.A slower ball does for Willey, just as he was getting going. He skies it and Kane Richardson takes a good catch off his own bowling.48th over: England 316-6 (Buttler 75, Willey 3) Buttler’s average with the scoop shot (or ramp) is 105, and his strike rate 223. He tries it again, the ball follows him, so he adjusts and dabs to backward point. There’s only a single in it, but that’s a stroke of genius. Australia are winning the final overs, though.47th over: England 310-6 (Buttler 71, Willey 3) Richardson K rejoins Richardson J in the attack and keeps it tightish, though he gets away with a near-beamer which Willey does well to squirt down to third man.An email lands from Geoff, who has just the one name, like Stormzy. “If John Starbuck is correct in his suggestion that donning combinations would improve almost any sport,” he wonders, “why has it done so little for baseball?”46th over: England 304-6 (Buttler 68, Willey 1) Richardson snaffles Moeen and almost gets Buttler too, as Tye just fails to e forward at fine leg and swallow a top-edged swish. After that fabulous little flurry, Buttler has gone back to scoring at only a run a ball.Moeen swings it languidly to deep square, where Agar claims a sharp low catch. Well, Moeen said he wasn’t going to change his ways, and he hasn’t.45th over: England 300-5 (Buttler 66, Ali 8) Tye keeps England just about in check.And John Starbuck picks up on Andrew Benton’s musings (42nd over). “Combination sports are best when the contrast is largest, as in very fastvery slow, so ice-hockey + crown green bowls, or table-tenniscroquet. Or you could improve almost any sport by insisting the players wear combinations.”44th over: England 295-5 (Buttler 64, Ali 5) Jhye Richardson gets three balls past Buttler’s bat, which is quite an achievement. And we even have some blue sky to encourage the Aussies.“Footage of the last two overs should be shown to teach young batters how to move through the gears,” says Nigel Phillips, quoting me just now. “Cricket should be shown on free-to-view TV to show young people what it is.” Amen to that. 43rd over: England 293-5 (Buttler 63, Ali 4) Moeen for Billings is actually an improvement at this stage, as Moeen shows by swatting his first ball over midwicket for four. Nonchalant.Billings drags one on, allowing Bumble to say “It’s a Welsh drag-on.” Billings remains out of form and out of luck, but he played his part – the 50 partnership had just come up, making this the first time in ODI history that the first five wickets have all yielded 50.42nd over: England 281-4 (Buttler 57, Billings 10) Short continues, in a further sign of Tim Paine’s guts. Buttler plays an off drive that is more of a hockey shot, lovely fast hands. He has made 24 off his last eight balls. As Ed Smith said, he has unique abilities.A thought from Andrew Benton. “What with all these international sports going on at the mo – football, cricket, rugby, golf, Wimbledon soon – in their own exclusive little sporty bubbles, I yearn for some crossover to break up the monotony, chess-boxing style. How about cricket-darts?” 41st over: England 273-4 (Buttler 52, Billings 7) Yes! Buttler goes crazy, but craftily. Jhye Richardson returns, bearing pace, which helps. First ball: a cracker past cover for four. Second: the finest ramp you’ve ever seen, for six over long stop (dropped by the man in the black hoodie). Third: another, slightly coarser ramp for six more. Fourth: a king cut for two. That’s fifty for Buttler, off 38 balls. Footage of the last two overs should be shown to teach young batters how to move through the gears.40th over: England 253-4 (Buttler 33, Billings 6) Another over for Short, another four runs. With ten overs to go, England are surely about to go for it. 39th over: England 249-4 (Buttler 32, Billings 5) Another decent over from Agar. Buttler needs some fireworks, and he will probably have to light them himself.In other news, the mighty Iceland are being held to a draw by the plucky Argentines.38th over: England 245-4 (Buttler 29, Billings 4) Emboldened by his own brilliance, Paine decides to risk another over from D’Arcy Short. He concedes only four, so the risk pays off. Sam Billings, given another chance by Eoin Morgan’s back spasm, needs to make use of it: there’s time for a quick 40.37th over: England 241-4 (Buttler 28, Billings 1) A tidy over from Agar, who has been a bit better than figures of 8-0-48-0 might suggest.36th over: England 239-4 (Buttler 27, Billings 0) Roy plays the first ball after the break for two behind point, and the next for four through wide mid-off. Among other strengths, he has been quite unperturbed by all these interruptions – but then Tye deceives him with an off-cutter. Good comeback from Tye to end an outstanding innings from Roy. He started off playing second fiddle, then stormed the podium. Well that’s come out of nowhere. Tye finds Roy’s inside edge, and the lip-swollen Paine takes a superb catch, somewhere to the left of his left ankle. He’s got some character, this guy. The end of a very fine innings.Paine’s lip looks bad, but he’s battling on. Goodness knows who the vice-captain would be. At least the rain has abated.Mid-36th over: England 233-3 (Roy 114, Buttler 27) Roy thumps a straight drive for four off the returning Tye. Poor old Paine cops one in the face, and then the drizzle returns. The pain, for Paine, comes mainly in the rain.Tim Paine, trying to stop a slower ball from Tye down the leg side, is hit in the face as the ball suddenly pops up at him. He seems to have a nasty cut. 35th over: England 228-3 (Roy 109, Buttler 27) Seeing two men at backward point, Roy decides it would be fun to bisect them with a reverse sweep.34th over: England 219-3 (Roy 102, Buttler 26) Stoinis’s last over, and England help themselves from the buffet, with a couple of twos and a drop-kick for four by Buttler off the last ball. The Aussies have been able to take one wicket but never two in quick succession, and every England batsman has reached 20. 33rd over: England 209-3 (Roy 101, Buttler 17) That little experiment was Short-lived. Agar returns, bowling a full length, almost yorkers, so Roy props forward, to pick up a hard-run two and a well-deserved hundred. He’s been so measured.32nd over: England 203-3 (Roy 97, Buttler 15) Stoinis continues, tries a bouncer, and watches it disappear over midwicket as Roy plays that imperious pull of his. A force for two by Buttler brings up the 200 off 190 balls. After flirting with the Aussies, the barometer has decided to stay with England for now.31st over: England 194-3 (Roy 92, Buttler 11) Short is worth a shot, if only because these two batsmen have apparently never faced a left-arm wristie in 50-over cricket. Buttler’s not bothered, though: he die some milking and then strokes a glorious off drive for four. Ten off the over.And D’Arcy Short, who should be still glowing from that catch, is coming on to bowl. He’s a left-arm wrist-spinner. A resumption is expected around 2.15pm, or 20 minutes’ time. One of the oddities of this England side is that they’ve dispensed with all the senior citizens from the Test team – Cook, Broad and Anderson – while getting many a wicket out of the oldest flinger in town, Liam Plunkett. He was talking to the press yesterday, prompting Vic Marks to draw parallels with the Rolling Stones. if you’d rather hear about Argentina v Iceland, go here for Rob Smyth’s MBM. I confess to video envy seeing that little clip of the Iceland fans practising the synchronised thunderclap. It knocks the Mexican wave into a cocked sombrero.The break is expected to be brief, again. In the meantime, do sign up for The Spin, one of the oldest and best cricket newsletters. It has a rotating cast, much like the spin in the England Test team, but usually more penetrating. 30th over: England 184-3 (Roy 91, Buttler 2) Buttler, missing a pull, takes one from Stoinis on the right thigh, then plays a lovely easy swat for a single. And they’re off again, with the barometer just swinging towards Australia: only 24-1 off the last five overs.29th over: England 182-3 (Roy 90, Buttler 1) Buttler, so good in the Test series against Pakistan, gets off the mark with a comfy tuck to square leg, and Tye finally keeps it tight. The Aussies have just crept back into this, but the rain should help England, by ruling out reverse swing. 28th over: England 179-3 (Roy 88, Buttler 0) So Root, like Bairstow, offered only a cameo. And here’s Jos Buttler, taking Eoin Morgan’s place at No 5 as well as captain, which gives him time to do some damage, weather permitting - the mizzle has returned.Root, in silky touch, suddenly pops a pull to deep square, where D’Arcy Short takes a lovely low catch. Caught Short indeed.27th over: England 177-2 (Roy 87, Root 21) You don’t see many threes at Sophia Gardens, but Root gets one with an elegant push past extra cover. This partnership is already 64, off 52 balls: the stage is set for something spectacular.Here’s Brian Withington again. “Sadly I don’t know the answer to David Tripp’s 14th over question about the potential uniqueness of concurrent Australian rugby, cricket and football internationals.” Ah. “However, if the cricket team (or Cardiff weather) can’t come to the rescue then I will stick my neck out and suggest it may well be the first time a nation has played and lost all three.”26th over: England 170-2 (Roy 84, Root 17) Tye tries one of his surely-not-that-many variations, the bouncer, and Roy smacks him for six to the long square boundary. In view of the rain, lunch is going to be reduced to 35 minutes. That should give everyone time to get half-way up the queue for the bar. 25th over: England 158-2 (Roy 75, Root 16) Roy gets a bouncer from Kane Richardson and plays a tennis smash, with fast hands, which deserves more than a single. The unrelated Richardsons have done pretty well (2 for 65 off 11 overs). The rest have 0 for 93 off 14.24th over: England 154-2 (Roy 71, Root 15) Roy just carries on where he left off, punching Tye past mid-off for four. Play will resume at five past. The poor old Aussies just had time to see their footballers and rugby players lose, so a nation’s honour is in their hands.Brian Withington takes advantage of the rain to run with a ball from the 20th over. “If Bairstow is lead guitar to Jason Roy’s rhythm, who plays drums and bass in this England beat combo? Reminds me of the old (Dave Allen?) joke about the drummer whose rhythm was so good that the Pope made him an honorary Catholic.” This is like an exam in which I’ve finally spotted a question I can answer. Bass: Hales – not the most demanding role. Drums: Buttler – holds it all together, gets the girl.It has become quite hard to see, so Marais Erasmus finally accepts that it’s time to wave the players off. A chance for the Aussies to watch their football brethren try and hold out for a point against the mighty France, but before they can change the channel, Paul Pogba scores.23rd over: England 147-2 (Roy 65, Root 14) Roy gets away with a snick off Jhye Richardson which would have been a dolly to first slip, had there been one. Australia are not going to win this by being defensive. Yet another question, this time from Mahendra. “Watching cricket \u0026amp football simultaneously, why is it that we don’t see Waughs, Clarkes, Taylors, Smiths in football and vice versa.

It’s all a bit tasty and it takes a while to quell. Lots for the referee to soak up there. Kolisi and Farrell are warned that any more scuffles will result in yellow cards being dished out. And now a-ha belts out over the public address system. Lovely.18 min: A flurry of South Africa lineouts as the heavy-breathing hosts look to reapply the pressure. Despite their best efforts, they’ve made a pretty dismal start. 16 min: Rassie Erasmus looks a little startled – again, as he was at Ellis Park last week. 14 min: It’s not to be 14 points in 14 minutes, with Farrell’s right boot lacking the gumption to make it between the posts. Nevertheless, a great start for Eddie Jones’s England in Bloemfontein. Jonny May thumps his chest, and it’s deja vu as, after great work by Mike Brown, the provider a moment ago sprints down the wing, beyond Siya Kolisi, the captain, and over the line. Here comes Owen Farrell to convert ...England create the space, and take full advantage through Mike Brown. It starts with great work from Billy Vunipola before Jonny May takes over the baton, cutting in from the wing to deadly effect before Brown runs over. Lovely stuff, with Farrell converting. 8 min: Farrell kicks into the safety of touch. And they look to build from the lineout, via Brown chasing a high kick before South Africa turnover. 7 min: England win a penalty in the scrum, cue a couple of fist pumps from Joe Launchbury and the Vunipolas.6 min: And now Farrell’s pass out to Daly is forward, very sloppy. South Africa are a few feet from the try-line, in a very promising central position. Here comes the scrum, de Klerk with the put in ...4 min: Owen Farrell scythes down De Allende, after the South Africa speedster picks off Ben Youngs’ sloppy pass. Farrell, the England captain, duly es in to rescue his team, and prevents the inevitable. 3 min: Ford’s canny crossfield kick picks out a marauding Jonny May another offside call soon puts pay to that. 2 min: Pollard thumps the ball into touch and England earn a lineout just outside the South Africa 22. 1 min: The first decision by the French referee is to penalise Faf de Klerk for moving offside. A simple start, with de Klerk a bit keen and surrendering a penalty. That dovetails nicely with England’s plans for a fast start.And we’re under way in Bloemfontein.The teams flood on to the pitch and, after a moment’s silence for the former Springbok Syd Nomis who passed away earlier on Saturday at the age of 76, we’re almost there ...There are some big boys in that South Africa lineup, none more so than the prop Frans Malherbe, who weighs in at 19st5lbs. In terms of England, a reminder that Danny Cipriani, for the first time since 2015, is back in the fold and among the replacements. Warm-ups are done and dusted in a slightly chilly Bloemfontein, the capital of Free State and a city 1400 metres above sea-level. We will be getting down to business shortly, after a few pre-match formalities anthems etc. My grandparents were very English and there was a lot of English heritage in the way we were brought up – all the teaspoons on the wall, chip butties on Sunday afternoon. Before we get started in South Africa, plenty to digest elsewhere, namely Ireland’s win over Australia – their first down under since 1979 to level the series – as well as France’s defeat to the All Blacks. Ireland’s captain, Peter O’Mahony, whose performance was lauded by head coach Joe Schmidt, saluted his team-mates: Last week they taught us a good few lessons, it has taken one of our best performances of the year to beat them. They are incredibly proud playing here at home. It was appropriate we put in one of our best performances of the year.It would have been disappointing for next week to be a dead rubber. We are looking forward to assessing the game and looking at what we did well and what we can improve for next week.”Even though he says otherwise, Eddie Jones is presumably nursing a headache, with four straight Test defeats tough to take:Believe in Bloemfontein has been the message from the England skipper Owen Farrell after four straight Test defeats (v South Africa, Ireland, France and Scotland). Heads have been put together, a few fingers pointed and a few harsh words been said. “A lot of honest conversations have gone on in a really productive way,” Farrell says. “We had a good chat about the discipline side of things. I just think we got stuck in a bit of a rut.”Eddie Jones, who remains relaxed about the importance of a result in this second Test, has not been afraid to ring changes from that first-Test defeat in Johannesburg, with the New Zealand-born flanker Brad Shields – fast-tracked into the England setup – promoted to the starting lineup after a cameo last time out, with former captain Chris Robshaw dropped. Supposedly Robshaw was one of the first to shake Shields’ hand upon the news. “I have loan of that jersey for the weekend and they are pretty big shoes to fill,” Shields says. “I won’t let that jersey down.” Meanwhile, Joe Launchbury slides back into the starting XV, replacing Nick Isiekwe in the forward pack after a calf injury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8591ed515b3fe5d30678aaad6fffda415b7ac62d/0_379_3949_2369/master/3949.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6003ba40e4bbeea230275320033e81fd","title":"us open 2018 third round live","story":"Shinnecock Hills is a wonderfully tough, old-school US Open test.

I was fat and borderline repulsive, but these traits had forced me to try and become funny. (I wasn’t witty or talented I was merely willing to abandon all dignity in order to gain approval.)After one break time, during which I felt I had been on top comedic form, I plucked up the courage to approach Sarah and ask her if she’d want to hang out. She laughed and said, “Very funny, Rom.” Our relative aesthetics meant that the very idea she might want to go out with me had to be a punchline.My only solace was to hope that Sarah’s life might progress as a series of awful failures, escalating to the point where she ended up destitute in the gutter, crying and wondering where it had all gone wrong, before wiping the tears from her eyes, looking to the sky and thinking, “I wish I had gone out with that fat Asian kid at school.”My school days have been very much back at the forefront of my mind while watching Love Island, the hit TV show full of Sarah Campbells. The extreme popularity of this programme is being hailed by many as the greatest ongoing threat to modern civilisation, as if we weren’t simultaneously dealing with the very real possibility of nuclear war. I haven’t seen too much of it, but what I have gathered is this: some incredibly attractive people are dropped off on an island and then have to pair up, drink lukewarm prosecco and have sex until, one by one, they are asked to leave. Essentially, this show is what happens when a TV producer is off their tits on a night out in Faliraki and suddenly thinks, “I reckon this might be a TV format.” It is a voyeur’s dream.But social commentators have become very upset, claiming that Love Island heralds a dumbing down of society, and that the record viewing figures suggest the imminent arrival of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. People have fixated on the fact that, last year, more people applied to Love Island than to Oxford and Cambridge, completely ignoring the fact that Love Island has much lower grade requirements and all you have to say in your personal statement is, “I very much enjoy the sex.”It is always interesting to see what the cultural elite deem appropriate for consumption by the masses, while simultaneously dismissing the masses as savages. Why do they find Love Island, in particular, so offensive? There are many shows that partner people up (First Dates, Love In The Countryside) and are not labelled the end of humanity. Even shows such as Big Brother, while isive, don’t tend to make it on to Question Time, where the panel last week debated whether the Oxbridge stat was “a fair reflection on our society”.The answer seems fairly obvious to me: we don’t want Love Island to be popular because all the contestants are hot. They have gorgeous, sculpted bodies with single-digit body fat percentages and hair that moves only in strict adherence to a preordained choreography. They look like every person who ignored you at school – the kind of people you see at the beach and then feel forced to keep your T-shirt on when you go into the sea. The beautiful people.The problem is that nobody ever admits this. Instead, they dress up their resentment as an anxiety about the demise of British culture and the state of the country’s youth. This is a lie: it is intellectual elitism. What I want to see is a think piece on Love Island in which the columnist simply admits, “I hate Love Island because it reminds me I have a dad bod.”Also, why is Oxbridge heralded as the yardstick by which young people should be measured? In order to get into those universities, you take your gifts and you work incredibly hard to maximise the potential of those gifts, until you achieve the hard-earned results that are not accessible to everybody. And that sounds a lot like the process required to attain a set of visible abs. We all seem blind to the fact that the type of people who get into Oxbridge benefit from fantastic genes every bit as much as somebody whose face demonstrates perfect mathematical symmetry. (This is all, of course, before we even get into discussing the inequities of the Oxbridge application system.)Love Island is not for me, nor would I ever want to be at a swimming pool near any of the contestants without having on three layers of clothing. But it’s a great thing that the show exists, and that people enjoy it: they should not be judged for doing so. Gogglebox, however, is still absolute crap.*Name left unchanged so that people can know she rejected me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcec03c05d9c2f380ec4af988d623fb79ad77148/0_3_3833_2299/master/3833.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e653d3263b38a7850e13a9e5c615c134","title":"oprah winfrey apple in 1bn programming push","story":"Tech giant’s partnership with Oprah looks to challenge rivals Netflix and Amazon in internet-based video Apple has announced a multiyear deal with Oprah Winfrey to create original programming, a coup in the battle for A-list talent and projects in the booming digital entertainment market.“Together, Winfrey and Apple will create original programs that embrace her incomparable ability to connect with audiences around the world,” Apple said in a statement.Apple gave no details of the type of programming that Winfrey would create, the value of the deal, or when it might be released. Winfrey had no immediate comment. Winfrey, 64, an influential movie and TV producer who also publishes a magazine, is expected to appear on screen, a source familiar with the deal said. Apple has not said how it plans to distribute its programming, to which it has committed an initial $1bn. The partnership is the biggest original content deal struck by Apple so far as it aims to compete with Netflix Inc, Amazon Inc and Time Warner Inc’s HBO. Netflix, which has said it will spend up to $8bn on programming this year, in May struck a multiyear deal with Barack and Michelle Obama to produce films, documentaries and other content. Netflix, the world’s leading streaming entertainment provider, has also lured prolific television producers Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes away from broadcast television. Amazon said in November it had bought the global television rights to The Lord of the Rings and would produce a multi-season series that explores new storylines preceding author JRR Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring. This week, Amazon also announced a development deal with Oscar-winning actor Nicole Kidman’s production company for movies and television. For its part, Apple in November ordered two seasons of a dramatic series with Hollywood stars Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, looking at the lives of people working on a morning television show. Other projects Apple has announced include a remake of Steven Spielberg’s 1980s science fiction anthology series Amazing Stories, based on Isaac Asimov’s influential Foundation science fiction novels, and a drama from La La Land movie director Damian Chazelle. Under the deal with Winfrey, she will remain chief executive of cable channel OWN, which she launched in 2011 in partnership with Discovery Inc. Winfrey in December extended her contract with OWN through 2025, OWN and Apple said. Under her contract with OWN, Winfrey can appear on camera on other platforms on a limited basis. Winfrey rose to fame as the host of her own television talk show, using it to build a media empire that s magazine publishing, movie and television production, cable TV and satellite radio. Born into poverty, she is one of the world’s wealthiest women and has been nominated for two Academy Awards. A rousing speech by Winfrey at the Golden Globes awards ceremony in January triggered an online campaign to persuade her to run for US president in 2020. She dismissed the notion, telling InStyle magazine in an interview, “It’s not something that interests me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0f1114a2f4551c5248eb96e4fd7d85c371974c1/901_108_4118_2471/master/4118.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6c730263a9733c9876a1670eb587ddce 1240w","title":"best us commencement speeches","story":"Mindy Kaling, Oprah Winfrey and other luminaries urge graduates to stand up for themselves and othersThe best college commencement speeches delivered to students graduating this summer featured the broad themes of empowerment, community service and empathy.

But we are also witnessing a sense of devotion to our democracy … we’re standing up to policies that hurt people … You will make mistakes in life, you will even fail … Take it from me … you need to be ready to lose some fights. What matters is whether you get up and keep going.Anita Hill, lawyer and academic, at Rutgers University, New JerseyPromise me, whether in times of certainty and clarity or in times of chaos, that you will be the bravest self you can be, to confront the challenges of the world. When uncertain times call, promise me that you will embrace community and not ision. And promise me, finally, that you will live with a commitment to equal justice under the law, today and throughout your entire lives.Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, at Duke University, North Carolina Fearlessness means taking the first step even if you don’t know where it will take you. It means being driven by a higher purpose rather than by applause. It means knowing that you reveal your character when you stand apart more than when you stand with a crowd. Be fearless. Be the last people to accept things as they are and the first people to stand up and change them for the better. Jimmy Carter, former president, at Liberty University, VirginiaEveryone decides: “This is the kind of person I choose to be.” We decide whether we tell the truth or benefit from telling lies. We’re the ones that decide: “Do I hate?

As chaos continues at the Mexican border over Trump’s policy of “zero tolerance” against anyone entering the US unlawfully, Session has underlined his power over a quasi-judicial immigration system that affects millions. The attorney general has the power to hire and fire immigration judges and make unilateral rulings such as the one he announced last Monday, which holds that those who cross the border illegally seeking sanctuary as victims of “private criminal activity”, as opposed to state-sanctioned persecution, will not generally qualify for asylum. The Trump administration has made increasing the number of immigration judges a priority in order to deal with a huge pile-up of cases. Currently about 350 judges in 60 US courts are tasked with handling a record backlog of more than 714,000 cases, according to Syracuse University’s Trac database. That is an increase of more than 171,000 cases since Donald Trump took office in January 2017. The problem is so acute that Sessions introduced an annual quota of at least 700 completed cases per judge in order for their performance to be graded “satisfactory” – which will put pressure on them to rush through complex cases, as asylum claims often are.Nevertheless, the Democratic lawmakers found evidence of unusual delays in the hiring process, and cited allegations that candidates were being rejected “based on their perceived political or ideological views”, which they interpreted as implying they were not conservative enough. The claims evoke a scandal from 2008, when a government report found evidence of political hiring in the Department of Justice during the George W Bush presidency, with aides appointing immigration judges and prosecutors with conservative views on topics such as abortion and same-sex marriage.Fox News last week obtained a response on the issue from the Department of Justice which said that 14 applicants since December 2016 were no longer under consideration for reasons such as voluntary withdrawal and concerns about personal conduct raised by background checks. Assistant attorney general Stephen Boyd said, according to Fox: “The Department of Justice does not discriminate on the basis of political affiliation.”In response, two congressmen , Lloyd Doggett and Elijah Cummings, issued a joint statement which said that the response did not fully address their concerns, and called for an independent investigation by the office of the inspector general.  spoke to one rejected judicial candidate, who requested anonymity. He was made a provisional offer during the Obama presidency but said his application was then subject to inexplicable delays last year. He said he was ultimately turned down with scant explanation and not given an opportunity to respond to any potential concerns about his background.“I was never asked to explain any problems and was given to understand there was no problem with my file … The court system is run by the DoJ but it’s not supposed to be an enforcement agency, it’s supposed to be a court,” he said.Sessions has sought to streamline the hiring process but has introduced a requirement that immigration judges have litigation experience. Biographies of new judges published by his department show many formerly worked as government prosecutors, frequently for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) – the federal agency that carries out detentions and deportations.The president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, Ashley Tabaddor, said her group supports independence from the justice department. “What we point to is that a traditional American judicial model recognizes that for the model to have true integrity and respect the judges have to be independent,” she told the .Sessions’s ruling has the potential to affect tens of thousands of pending cases. “I do anticipate it to have a direct impact because in a large percentage of the iniduals from Central America who are filing for asylum, their fear of return tends to be based on the fear of gang violence or domestic violence,” Tabaddor said.Sessions argues that reform is necessary to stop what he views as a gaming of the system by migrants dubiously claiming a “credible fear” of persecution if they return to their home countries. However, 16 retired immigration judges and former members of the Board of Immigration Appeals signed a statement calling his asylum ruling “an affront to the rule of law”.The number of applicants without legal representation is also increasing. In another key difference between immigration courts and criminal courts, the government need not provide public defenders for people without an attorney.“The decision underscores the importance of representation by competent attorneys now more than ever,” said Geoffrey Hoffman, immigration clinic director at the University of Houston Law Center."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92fa4b2ea7192ed9feec59824938ca65a014d0c8/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58f1b0d61088b7820b891cb5fc67d731","title":"delhi blanketed by smog so toxic it cant be measured","story":"Dust storms come months before the start of city’s traditional ‘pollution season’Smog more toxic than can be measured by monitoring devices has blanketed the Indian capital this week, months before the start of Delhi’s traditional “pollution season”.A thick haze was visible across the city from Tuesday and some government pollution monitors have recorded concentrations of 999 – the highest they can measure – as dust storms kicked up in nearby Rajasthan state blanketed the region.Though the billowing clouds of dust and sand were blamed for the immediate spike in pollution levels, the sight of dense smog engulfing Delhi months before winter has underscored a growing awareness that harmful air is a year-round problem for the city.Air quality in Delhi usually begins to plummet in October when slower winds and cooler temperatures trap pollutants closer to the ground.But data published by the government’s Central Pollution Control Board shows that air quality has been classed “very unhealthy” – with index scores as high as 270 – every April and May for the past three years, or since authorities began collecting and publishing the statistics.Just a single day in April or May of the past three years had air classified as “good” – 12 April this year, when levels fell to 99. “It clearly shows that this is also a summertime problem,” said Aishwarya Sudhir, an independent researcher who studies air quality in India.Authorities have ordered a halt to all construction in the capital and its satellite cities until the weekend to reduce pollution levels, and doctors have advised people to stay indoors as much as possible. Meteorologists said the presence of a layer of dust across the city is also trapping heat, sending temperatures soaring in excess of 40C.Concern about north India’s air quality crisis is usually most acute after the Hindu festival of Diwali in autumn, when hundreds of thousands of Indians release firecrackers that combine with existing pollutants to form a poisonous haze over the region that persists for months until temperatures cool. Public health experts said pollution levels on some days in November last year were the equivalent of smoking 50 cigarettes per day.India, home to 14 of the world’s top 20 most polluted cities, has the highest rate of respiratory diseases of any country. A leading lung specialist, Arvind Kumar, says the cancer patients he sees Delhi are younger, more often female and more likely to be non smokers than those outside the city.Children are the most vulnerable: a 2015 study concluded about half Delhi’s 4.4m schoolchildren had stunted lung development and would never completely recover.But pressure on local and central governments to act usually clears along with the air in February when warmer temperatures help to thin the smog.Sudhir said this week’s spike in pollution was a wake-up call that Delhi’s air is rarely safe. “Polluting activities keep going on in the city during summer, including construction, allowing road dust to linger, the operation of coal-fired power plants and other things,” she said.Under an action plan in place since January 2017, pollution levels of the kind recorded this week should have resulted in trucks being denied entry into the city, the closure of brick kilns and other polluting industries, and a ban on using diesel generators.Yet the government seems only to implement some of these measures, and only in response to public outcry, she said.“We tend to act only when it’s an emergency,” she said. “There were forecasts that dust storms would sweep the entire region. They should have acted on these weeks ago, not when it became this severe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4516c7a4927f643fc26d9c775026ade0241651f0/0_63_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d3b9f07fce2c0a415bb3e292241b49f","title":"colombias election peace ivan duque gustavo petro","story":"The shadow of ex-president Álvaro Uribe, a strong critic of the Farc peace deal, hangs over Sunday’s runoff vote between his protege Iván Duque and the leftwinger Gustavo PetroOn a leafy street outside a private university in Medellín, Colombia’s second city, José Botero is plastering cars with bumper stickers. “Vote for Duque,” he shouts to the approval of passing drivers, who honk their horns. “He’s Colombia’s only choice!”Botero is campaigning for Iván Duque, the frontrunner in a bitter presidential race that will conclude on Sunday in a runoff between two candidates from the extremes of the political spectrum. Duque, a conservative from the Democratic Centre party, and Gustavo Petro, a former mayor of Bogotá – and onetime urban guerrilla – are both campaigning on anti-establishment platforms and picked up enough of the vote in last month’s first round to eliminate a handful of moderate candidates. Hanging in the balance in Sunday’s vote is a fragile peace with the former rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) – a deal which Duque opposes and Petro supports.Botero’s mother was still pregnant with him when his father was kidnapped and murdered by the Farc – and like many Colombians, he was disgusted by the peace agreement. The deal, which won the outgoing president Juan Manuel Santos a Nobel peace prize, formally ended a war that left 220,000 dead and 7 million displaced. But its terms – including guaranteed seats in congress for Farc leaders and promises of softer sentencing – proved too much for voters who narrowly rejected the agreement in a referendum in late 2016.The deal was amended and later ratified in congress, but many still want it revised. Duque – who has promised to amend key parts of the deal – promises them that opportunity.“No one is against peace,” said Botero, echoing one of Duque’s talking points. “But we won’t see it with the deal that Santos signed.”Pedro Piedrahita Bustamante, a political science professor at the University of Medellín, said Duque’s camp has exploited isions opened by the peace process. “Colombians are culturally accustomed to war,” he said. “Justice is seen as an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”Duque, a fresh-faced but prematurely grey 41-year-old, spent much of his adult life in Washington DC working at the Inter-American Development Bank, before he was hand-picked for a senate seat in 2014 by former president Álvaro Uribe. Like his mentor, he is a social conservative: tough on drugs and crime and opposed to gay marriage.Much of Duque’s voter base was gifted to him by Uribe, who left office in 2010, but remains a major player in Colombian politics.Uribe’s tenure was dogged by scandal. A state intelligence agency was shut down after he used it to spy on the opposition, journalists and members of the supreme court. His military campaign against the rebels was marked by grave human rights abuses: thousands of civilians were murdered in order to falsely inflate combat statistics.But he commands huge support in his hometown Medellín and the surrounding Antioquia province, which voted overwhelmingly against the peace deal.Colombia has experienced one of the longest internal conflicts in history. It started in the 1960s following a turbulent period known as \u0027la violencia\u0027.\u0026nbspOn the one hand, the Colombian government fought to maintain order and stability, seeking to protect the interests of its citizens and the legitimacy of the state.\u0026nbspOn the other, there were guerilla groups – like Farc and ELN – who said they were fighting for the poor and social justice.And then paramilitary groups emerged, claiming they were reacting to the threats from the guerillas while taking justice into their own hands.More than seven million people were uprooted from their homes and driven to cities fearing for their lives.\u0026nbspAt least two hundred thousand people lost their lives.Numerous human rights violations were committed. Hundreds of people were forcibly recruited and taken far into the Colombian jungle to fight. More than 8,000 cases of child recruitment were recorded.Overall, there have been more than eight million victims, due to the conflict. One out of every five Colombians has been directly affected.After talks lasting more than four years, a peace treaty was signed with Farc in November 2016 effectively bringing the conflict to an end. Key to the agreement are deals on rural development, political participation, illicit drugs and reparations for victims.Farc has given up all of their weapons (verified by the UN) and transitioned into a political party with a voice in the political process.With less money tied up in defence, the country\u0027s spending priorities should now be switching to education, health, infrastructure, the economy and the environment.\u0026nbspBut some are yet to experience \u0027peace\u0027. Scars are deep. Reconciliation, reintegration and access to opportunities take time. President Juan Manuel Santos is due to stand down in 2018 and some election campaigning has stoked concerns over the peace deal.“Like him or hate him, Uribe has been a force in every major election since 2002 when he first came to power,” Piedrahita said. “And here in Antioquia he is the king.”Uribe is constitutionally barred from re-election, and although both men have vehemently denied that the former president would have any say in government if his protege is elected, many see Duque as his puppet.Before Duque announced his candidacy, many Uribe supporters had already pledged their vote to the former president’s cause. Billboards appeared on rural highways, emblazoned with the words “whoever Uribe says”.“Uribe is the best president Colombia has ever had,” said Johnny Andrés Copete, a civil servant who moonlights as a community organiser for Democratic Centre. “But Duque is the future now – there’s no ision here.”In Medellín, support for Duque is practically universal. Cars are plastered with his campaign’s bumper stickers billboards loom over the city showing him with his arms out, as though inviting a hug.José Rodríguez, one of the city’s countless taxi drivers, admitted he had never heard of Duque until a year ago. “But we trust Uribe here – if he could ever run again, I’d vote for him.”Nowadays, the hot-tempered former president presents an image of an affable, grandfatherly figure – but that view is far from universal. Luz Marina Galeano remembers Uribe’s tenure well. She leads a group of women who lost loved ones in one of Medellín’s poorest slums when Uribe ordered a military crackdown on Farc’s urban militias.As army Black Hawk helicopters whirled overhead, more than 1,000 soldiers flooded the streets of the Comuna 13 district, rooting out suspected rebels and their supporters. When the troops withdraw, paramilitaries filled the vacuum, continuing a terror campaign against civilians.“We victims remember the war because we lived it,” said Galeano. Galeano’s husband was accused by paramilitaries of working with the guerrillas, and was last seen being dragged from a bus in 2008. His remains are thought to lie with hundreds of others in a landfill site overlooking the city. “A vote for Duque is the same as voting for Uribe – and it means more war,” she said.Uribe has attempted to undermine several investigations into his involvement in paramilitary massacres, and with Duque at the helm opponents worry the former president could avoid any legal reckoning. A key witness in one investigation recently turned up dead.Steven Levitsky, professor of government at Harvard University and co-author of How Democracies Die, worries that should Duque win, Colombia risks backsliding towards authoritarianism.“There’s certainly cause for concern,” he said. “If you look back at the Uribe presidency, the human rights record was terrible. You saw various attempts to concentrate power and various efforts – some successful – to violate civil liberties.”The question many are asking is whether Duque – who in his rhetoric is more moderate than Uribe – will be able to distance himself from his mentor. “The more distance that appears between the two, the safer Colombian democracy is,” said Levitsky, adding that the leader in modern history to have successfully ruled via a puppet leader is Vladimir Putin. “It may seem that Duque is a political nobody without much political experience or talent, so it looks from the vantage point of today that Uribe should have a pretty easy time of controlling him.”But for Duque’s supporters, he remains the only option regardless of what academics say. His market-friendly approach differs from Petro, who rails against multinational corporations.Petro’s hesitancy in distancing himself from neighbouring Venezuela’s late president Hugo Chávez also opened him up to criticism. More than a million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia to escape their country’s political and economic crisis. Some voters, stoked by bellicose rhetoric, worry that Petro could lead Colombia into similar chaos.“I’m voting for Duque for the salvation of my country,” said Camila Rodríguez, a student in Medellín voting for the first time in her life. “If Petro wins, the Farc won’t answer for their crimes and we risk becoming like Venezuela.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ded2b28d7911a34abff7765aa076aa4472b843/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38451a10e79ede5cb832a681472b4f84","title":"italy bars two more refugee ships from ports","story":"Matteo Salvini says Lifeline and Seefuchs ships will have to land migrants elsewhereItaly’s interior minister has sparked a new migration crisis in the Mediterranean by barring two rescue boats from bringing refugees to shore, a week after the Aquarius was prevented from docking.Italy’s closure of its ports to the migrant rescue ship Aquarius, which was carrying 620 people, triggered warnings from aid agencies of a deadly summer at sea for people trying to cross the Mediterranean.Axel Steier, the co-founder of Mission Lifeline which operates the Lifeline ship, said his crew had rescued more than 100 migrants off Libya on Friday in an operation with a US warship, and transferred them to a Turkish merchant vessel.He said his ship was too small to make the journey from Libya to Italian ports and that he always transferred migrants to other ships, but insisted those craft should have the right to land in Italy.“I am sure there is an obligation for Italy to take them because its closest safe harbour is Lampedusa. We hand over migrants to Europe because of the Geneva convention,” he said.Vessels chartered by an assortment of European NGOs have plied the waters off Libya for three years, rescuing migrants from leaking boats and transporting them to Sicily.Following Salvini’s decision to prevent the Aquarius from docking, however, Malta quickly followed suit, leaving the vessel stranded at sea until Spain offered to take the ship. It is due to arrive in Valencia on Sunday.Crews of the NGO boats say Salvini’s port closures leaves them without anywhere close by to take the people they rescue, and that the move will prove counterproductive.“It will not stop people coming,” said Ruben Neugebauer, of the German charity ship Sea Watch. “They will come anyway, but more of them will die.”Sea Watch refused last week to take 40 migrants rescued by the US navy ship Trenton off Libya, fearing a fate similar to that of the Aquarius. Trenton waited four days before being allowed to dock in Sicily.Charities say the NGO boats are a vital lifeline, rescuing more than 88,000 people in the past two years, but critics say they are a pull factor, encouraging people to make the dangerous sea journey. More than 600,000 migrants have made the crossing from Libya to Italy in the past four years, and Salvini’s stance reflects frustration that the rest of Europe refuses to take its share of arrivals. At least 13,000 people have drowned trying to reach European shores. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, accused Salvini last week of cynicism and irresponsibility, but at the same time refused to allow the Aquarius to dock at French ports. “Malta and Italy didn’t open their ports, but then most other European governments didn’t help either,” said Izza Leghtas, a senior advocate at Europe for Refugees International. “They are all passing the ball among themselves.“If the NGO boats are unable to land the people they rescue and cease to operate, Operation Sophia, an EU anti-smuggler mission patrolling the Mediterranean, may take up some of the slack. NGOs, however, say its warships operate too far out to sea, given that people traffickers favour towing rubber boats full of migrants to the edge of Libya’s 12-mile territorial waters before setting them adrift."},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

Saudi Arabia has provided air support, with targeting guidance and refueling coming from the U.S.International aid groups and the UN cautioned the Saudi-led coalition from launching the assault. Their fear is that a protracted fight could force a shutdown of Hodeida\u0027s port at a time when a halt in aid risks tipping millions into starvation.Some 70 percent of Yemen\u0027s food enters via the port, as well as the bulk of humanitarian aid and fuel supplies. Around two-thirds of the country\u0027s population of 27 million relies on aid and 8.4 million are already at risk of starving.For its part, the Saudi-led coalition says it had no choice but to launch the assault as the port provided millions of dollars for the Houthis through customs controls.Please review our commenting policyGlasgow School of Art fire: Devastating blaze guts historic Mackintosh BuildingTory MP, 33, eloquently sums up Brexit argument in 440-word Commons speechWartime sweethearts reunited after grandmother sees Spitfire mechanic on TV decades after they said goodbyeEid truce between Afghan army and Taliban marred by deadly blastNotes from the Field, Royal Court, review: giving America\u0026#39s trauma an urgent voiceComment: Businesses still haven\u0026#39t woken up to the calamity of Theresa May\u0026#39s decision to leave the single marketThe mother of Billy Caldwell says she is \u0026#34over the moon\u0026#34 as Home Office releases medicinal cannabis oilJapanese men no longer calling all the shots at homeDisillusioned Farc victims turn back on Colombia peace deal as they vote for hardline presidentWorld Cup fever stokes bitter rivalries in Bangladesh, despite the fact it doesn\u0026#39t have a team\u0026#39Smart drugs\u0026#39 epidemic as one in 12 adults admit taking them - with most trying them at workComment: 21-hour Ryanair delay left pregnant woman in hospital – and it won\u0026#39t pay compensationLove Island, week 2 recap: a masterclass in what a handsome face can do to the human spirit Dementia checks from 40 to be carried out by GPs under plan to tackle diseaseMedical cannabis in UK: Billy Caldwell case renews debate over \u0026#39inhumane\u0026#39 lawsBehind the Shutter: John Moore on chronicling the militarisation of the US-Mexico borderComment: Roll up, roll up!

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelClick to followThe Independent OnlineSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autismStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”Nutritionist reveals truth about health benefits of soya foodsWhen kids run for 15 minutes in school every day, here’s what happens How the military is helping tackle mental health problems Graphic cigarette-style health warnings also effective on sugary drinkPeople without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

But now here she is, a teenager, and we are watching Love Island together.I am a Love Island virgin, which are three words you won’t hear together very much over the next eight weeks. I have never seen it before, and am only vaguely aware of it. That isn’t to say I’m some television snob I’ve watched copious amounts of Big Brother. I do like I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. I have caught myself laughing at Mrs Brown’s Boys. I even saw The Chase once.But somehow, Love Island has been slightly beyond the periphery of my experience. I mean, I’ve never seen The Only Way is Essex, but I feel like I have. Love Island, though… my reality TV filter must be clogged, and the past three\u0026nbspseries of it have been caught up in the webbing, never really permeating even my subconscious mind.I have a vague idea that Love Island is some combination of castaways having to undergo Bear Grylls-style survivalist trials crossed with the sort of orgy the Marquis de Sade might have dreamed about after eating a particularly pungent cheese too close to bedtime.So, here we are, settling in front of ITV2, my teenage daughter and I. My wife questions the wisdom of Alice encouraging me to watch a programme which, she informs me, will feature a parade of nubile young women in bikinis, as though I am a pensioner in a comedy sketch who might have a heart attack. But I am insistent Alice and her friends have been frantically Snapchatting all evening in excitement at the prospect of series four of Love Island. This will help me get down with the kids, I am sure of it.I ask Alice for a brief précis of what it’s all about as the titles start. She tells me that there will be more boys than girls and everyone has to couple up but the spare boy then has to steal a girl from\u0026nbspone of the others and at the end of the first round the boy without a girl is unceremoniously dumped from the show.How utterly awful, I think. And is there a point to it all? Apparently, yes £50,000 for the last couple standing. And, apparently, “Instagram promotions”, whatever that might entail. But wait monogamy is not the name of the game. Every so often there has to be a process of “recoupling”, says Alice, which sounds to me like something unpleasant from an episode of 1970s sci-fi series Logan’s Run.This, I ponder, is going to be an interminable couple of months. Surely they must do something other than pant over each other? Yes, Alice says. There are tasks and challenges. What, like they have to catch fish and find coconuts and stuff?A glamour model from Essex  who says: I’m definitely more about personality.Londoner Josh, coming to the Island with A-lister stories such as: Anthony Joshua once put me in a headlock for having a terrible haircutBlue-eyed model from Plymouth swapping the catwalk for Love Island.Coming from South Wales, Rosie\u0027s a solicitor: I’m like Legally Blonde… Only Legally Brunette”Student from York: I’m a party animal and I think you really get to know somebody when you go clubbing with them.Recognise the name? Yes, she\u0027s the daughter of Eastenders actor Danny Dyer. From East London, the barmaid says: I am a girly girl. Having a friendship with a girl in the villa is just as important as finding romance.Coming from Newcastle, the personal trainer and gym director says: “I would say I’m a ten out of ten. Maybe a nine out of ten... I’m not good at washing the dishes.”A West End performer from London, Samira says: I’m looking for an experience that I’ve never had before, loads of fun, the opportunity to meet a really nice guy, or even a best friend, and the chance to find myself.A model from Liverpool, Harley says: “My nickname from my friends is a, maybe because I always go after what I want and I always get it.From Staffordshire, the Nuclear Systems Design Engineer says: “I’m looking for a partner, I’m looking for someone I can settle down with and tame my wild lifestyle.”The retail manager and part-time model from Blackpool says: “I don’t do my nails, or have hair or lash extensions. Everything on me is real I am who I am.”An A\u0026ampE Doctor who has already angered the Daily Mail by taking time off his job to appear on the ITV show, Alex comes from Carmarthen, West Wales. He says: I don’t like high maintenance girls. I think it’s brilliant to look good but spending three hours to get ready to go and walk on the beach is too much for me.Another model, this one from London. I have a fun energy and I am a spiritual person, he says. I’d like to think I have a depth to me so I guess that stands out and I look at things quite deeply.The oldest person to join this year\u0027s competition, Laura is a air hostess from Stirling, Scotland. “The emoji that best describes me is probably the blonde girl, she says, because I’m just a weirdo cause I’m always just like, \u0027Hey, soz about me.\u0027A student and construction worker who has a Hermione Granger\u0027s wand tattoo on his arm. Niall says: “My ex would probably say that I’m immature and a bit of an attention seeker - and she wouldn’t be wrong.”Last but not least, we have a Stationary Sales Manager from Kent. “I consider myself really good looking and so far in my life I’ve had no complaints, he says. I get lots of compliments.”She laughs. No, not like that at all. And as the first of the female contestants begins to arrive, I start to understand. This is not so much Bear Grylls as Bare Arse. The girls are deposited at a posh hotel inidually, via Jeep, dressed in the teeniest, tiniest of bikinis. There is Samira, who is a dancer, Hayley, who is a model, Kendall, who manages a shoe shop. They are wearing a handkerchief’s worth of fabric between them. By the time Danny Dyer’s daughter rocks up, I am secretly wishing someone would put some clothes on. I must be getting old.I lose track of who is who because I’ve had a sudden moment of dissonance. The voiceover guy has a Scottish accent that sounds awfully familiar. It is Iain Stirling, Alice informs me. “Don’t you remember? He used to be on CBBC.”Oh my God. He’s the fresh-faced young chap who used to come on with Hacker T Dog. I always had a fondness for Hacker because he was from Wigan, like me. And now his mate Iain is narrating this cesspit. I look at my daughter, and remember those years of Tracy Beaker and Dora the Explorer. Truly, the days of innocence are over.I ask Alice, cautiously, nervously, if she looks up to these girls, whose makeup has more mass than their clothing and who are talking about willies. She rolls her eyes. “It’s just entertainment, Dad.” I think there are five practically naked girls cavorting on screen now, but to be quite honest I’m eyeing up the fire pit on the sun terrace. Is it gas powered? Where does the canister go?But here comes Caroline Flack, presiding over things like some brothel keeper in a Wild West frontier town. Because that’s exactly what it feels like when the boys turn up, one by one, like cattlemen who have been on the trail too long, excitedly wringing their stetsons and being invited by Flack to inspect the lineup of girl flesh on offer and take their pick.Oh, the girls do have a tiny bit of agency they are allowed to take a step forward if the boy in front of them takes their fancy. But ultimately, the guy gets to choose, though I am told these roles reverse in the coming days.The boys are all rippling six packs and tattoos. There’s one called Niall, who seems sweetly funny, and a guy called Wes, who claims to be some kind of engineer in the nuclear industry, except he’s having trouble saying the word “nuclear”. He gives up and falls back on some double entendre, which I’m 100 per cent sure some researcher has not written for him, promising with a leery wink to “engineer the ride of someone’s life” and then, if that was a bit too subtle, says something about having a big gear stick.My wife, no doubt thinking ahead to getting up at 6.30am today, wonders just how these people get eight weeks off work to do this. And that’s never more pressing a question than when Alex turns up. He’s an A\u0026ampE doctor. How can they spare him? He’s presumably done six years of medical school so he can try to crack off with a girl on a televised Club 18-30 holiday. Doesn’t he know how hard-pressed the NHS is? Hasn’t he seen 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE?Half an hour in and I try to get into the spirit of things by betting my daughter a fiver (I know, I know, the sheer crimes of moral turpitude we have descended to) that a boy whose name sounds like\u0026nbspEeyore, but is Eyal, will pick Samira, the dancer, who seems quite switched on compared to the others. I lose the wager. I’m disappointed in Eyal. I thought he had more about him.We meet Jack, who has the most astonishingly white teeth I have ever seen in my life. Apparently he went all the way to Turkey to get them done. You could see the glow of his teeth from the International Space Station.\u0026nbspI have drifted off when someone says, in what context I know not, that it’s “too soon to spoon!” Is it too soon to switch over and watch Lucy Worsley cosplaying a suffragette, I wonder?By this point I am finding it all quite dreadful, and not because I’m old. It’s because it reminds me of what it was like to be young. If you were ever left standing tearfully at the end of musical chairs, if you ever were picked last for games, if you ever walked home alone from a disco and listened to “How Soon Is Now?” by The Smiths on repeat while staring mournfully at your Betty Blue poster, if despite your best efforts you could only ever cultivate the physique of Little Plum from The Beano, then Love Island is a hateful parade of everything you wanted to be but weren’t.I look at Alice. God, I think, please don’t ever be so shallow as these people. But she’s on Snapchat with her friends. One of them likes Jack, he of the luminous gnashers. Alice pulls a face. Who do you like best, I ask? Eyal.Back on screen, Eyal is indeed coming across as, relatively, deep. He is trying to explain to Hayley, the model, what the word “superficial” means. There’s a new guy arrived, called Adam, whose job is to break up one of the couples and get his chosen girl to be with him. It’s becoming like a standard night out, except there are no fights. Apparently giving someone who tries to steal your girl a good shoeing is verboten and gets you kicked out.A little too late, perhaps, I start to wonder if this is really appropriate for Alice. But she has already seen the latest season of 13 Reasons Why, and also informs us that she has watched a movie called Ibiza that is trailed in the ad break which seems to be very heavy on jokes revolving around male ejaculation. Where did those Dora the Explorer days go? When Adam is going round trying to steal girls I want to shout at the screen, “Swiper no swiping!” But it would just make me sad.Everyone goes to sleep, the “couples” sharing beds. They are young and full of self-esteem, and no one is in their forties\u0026nbspand worried about snoring or accidental nocturnal flatulence. As far as I can tell, nobody has sex, which is a relief. It’s probably the best night’s kip Alex the A\u0026ampE doctor has had for years.The full line up for Love Island 2018 has been announcedWhy we need to stop being snobby about Love IslandLove Island bosses used Tinder to find contestants for the new seriesLove Island bosses are thinking of making an LGBTQ versionAre you embarrassed watching this with me, I ask.\u0026nbspAlice shrugs. “Not on the first episode,” she says. “I probably would be, later on.” It will, I am told, get heavy later on. I am slightly aghast. People will actually have sex? On the telly?There was one couple that didn’t last year, says Alice. One couple that didn’t do it? Only one? I’m not sure whether to feel proud of them or sorry for them.It feels like this is going to be a very long eight weeks, daily doses of people pretty much doing the same thing over and over again. A bit like Dora the Explorer. And even with the salacious promise of off-screen sex among these beautiful, vacuous people, I imagine it’s going to be less the Marquis de Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom than 56 Days of Sod All.It’s too much time to devote to these people, and I’m afraid Alice might be on her own – with her pals on Snapchat of course – for the rest of Love Island. I gave it a go and it at best bored me, at worst made me feel vaguely angry and depressed.Though I might tune in tonight, just to see who gets kicked out after last night’s cliffhanger…Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is textbook-changing stuff.”The photosynthesis recognisable to many from current textbooks involves\u0026nbspthe green pigment chlorophyll-a, which gives plants their distinctive hue.This pigment absorbs red light while reflecting away greens, blues and purples.Science news in pictures123 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 223 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 323 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.423 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1723 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1823 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2023 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2223 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2323 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Chlorophyll-a is present in all plants, as well as algae and photosynthetic bacteria, and scientists long assumed that there was a “red limit” on photosynthesis.Astrobiologists have used this supposed limit to gauge whether complex life could be evolving on distant planets in other solar systems.However, some photosynthetic bacteria known as cyanobacteria have another trick up their microscopic sleeves.\u0026nbspResearchers found another form of chlorophyll working in communities of these creatures growing in shaded conditions in “bacterial mats” in Yellowstone National Park and inside rocks found on Australian beaches.In near-infrared light, the chlorophyll-a systems of these bacteria shut down and a different variety – chlorophyll-f – begins operating in lower energy conditions “beyond the red limit”.Junk food-loving bacteria, not extra weight, cause arthritisProfessor Rutherford and his team tested these abilities by placing cyanobacteria communities into cupboards fitted with infrared LEDs.“Finding a type of photosynthesis that works beyond the red limit changes our understanding of the energy requirements of photosynthesis,” said Dr Andrea Fantuzzi, co-author of the study that was published in the journal Science.“This provides insights into light energy use and into mechanisms that protect the systems against damage by light.”Besides broadening the search for aliens, the discovery could help scientists genetically engineer crops that can survive in a wider range of light conditions.Dr Dennis Nurnberg, the first author of the study, said: “I did not expect that my interest in cyanobacteria and their erse lifestyles would snowball into a major change in how we understand photosynthesis.\u0026nbsp“It is amazing what is still out there in nature waiting to be discovered.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He fled his country after receiving death threats from the Taliban and arrived in the UK in 2014.Afghan interpreters who worked for British Army \u0027dismally failed\u0027Afghan interpreters still denied right to remain despite Tory pledgeAfghan interpreters told they \u0027can stay in UK for free\u0027 Yet Mr Husseinkhel was threatened with deportation and forced to spend a total of 48 days in immigration detention after the Home Office rejected his asylum claim on multiple occasions.A plan to remove him from the country in December was halted after his plight was revealed by The Independent, prompting an outcry from former military colleagues, who\u0026nbspcampaigned to let him remain in the UK.Former British Army troops and squadron leaders who worked with Mr Husseinkhel during the Afghan conflict said he “risked his life” on the front line in and around Helmand Province.Speaking in London after receiving the letter granting him leave to remain, the 27-year-old said he was pleased to finally have UK status, but felt he had been “punished” by the Home Office.“It’s been two and a half years of mental torture. I’ve tried so hard to get through to someone at the Home Office, but I got nothing,” he said.“When I got to the UK, I explained to the government why I was here. They know everything about what I’ve done for this country – how I put my life at risk. But they ignored everything. It felt like I was being punished.”Mr Husseinkhel urged that policy should change to help other interpreters who are still “in limbo”. He said: “I have lots other Afghan interpreters who have put their lives on the line but are still waiting. The Home Office has let down interpreters. They put us in a really horrible situation.“I didn’t leave Afghanistan because I wanted to. I was in danger and was putting my family in danger there. The Ministry of Defence should call on the Home Office to protect interpreters. We’ve done a good job. But the Home Office has let us down.”It comes after a damning report by MPs found that Afghan interpreters who served for the British Army have been “dismally failed” by the UK government, with a scheme designed to offer them protection failing to bring a single one to safety in Britain.Home secretary Sajid Javid\u0026nbspannounced earlier this month\u0026nbspthat Afghan interpreters who worked with British troops fighting the Taliban would be allowed to stay in the UK for free, but it emerged shortly after\u0026nbspthat the policy only applied\u0026nbspto those who arrived in the UK on a specific five-year visa scheme in 2012.Simon Diggins, a retired colonel\u0026nbspwho worked in Afghanistan between 2008 and 2010, said there were around 2,000 interpreters who worked for the Army and had been granted no protection. He\u0026nbspcalled for wider changes over\u0026nbspthe protection offered to interpreters.\u0026nbsp“They were vital. It wasn’t just about providing translation services. What they gave us was insights into the culture, the background. They could really help us to understand what was going on,” he told The Independent.“We need a change in policy. There’s a better way of doing this. These interpreters shouldn’t have to apply for asylum. We should be looking after people who we relied on. I’ve not met a single member of the armed forces who isn’t passionate about this.”UK news in picturesFire fighters attend the scene of a second fire at Glasgow\u0027s School of Art four years after part of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh designed building was destroyed by fire.

And MP Bob Blackman was accused of endorsing Islamophobia after posting an anti-Islam article on Facebook.Former Tory chairman Baroness Warsi backed the inquiry call, as she called on her party to “stop denying that it exists”.The first female Muslim cabinet minister said it was one of the reasons the Tories had lost votes, as their Muslim supporters went elsewhere.She added: Its burying its head in the sand and now unfortunately its playing out in a very embarrassing way, in a very public way.The Muslim Council of Britains Secretary General Harun Khan said in a letter to Tory Chairman Brandon Lewis: Our democracy should not be overshadowed by a divisive culture within political parties that scapegoats minorities and alienates some who share similar political positions.Instead, fellow Britons should feel enthused to vote for and indeed aspire for office in whichever party that they feel makes the best political argument.He called for the party to release a full list of Islamophobia incidents in the party, and adopt a programme of education and training.But Tory chiefs turned down a party-wide probe into the issue.A Conservative Party spokesman said: “We take all such incidents seriously, which is why we have suspended all those who have behaved inappropriately and launched immediate investigations”.But Labour MP Wes Streeting demanded the Tories look at themselves seriously, like Labour should do with anti-Semitism.He said: “It’s easy to criticise other parties but much harder to hold a mirror up to one’s own.“Time for Conservative MPs to speak up about this, just as many of us have done about antisemitism in Labour.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Without that ultimate weapon we are certain to get a poor deal.The Prime Minister cannot accept what a small handful of Remainers determined to stop Brexit are demanding.As she has rightly said, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.The people said leave, not leave when the EU gives us permission.The EU Withdrawal Bill, which MPs voted on this week, is about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure.Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Government on this key bill, cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends.If Conservatives do not demonstrate discipline in support of Theresa May on this, then we risk letting him into power.The Government has already said the EU Withdrawal Bill can be framed so as to give Parliament a vote on the final outcome, but without blocking the UK’s departure even without a deal.The Bill will go back to the House of Lords on Monday, and is likely then to return to the House of Commons.We need to get this out of the way, because it is 14 months on from triggering Article 50 and we still have not discussed the vital trade relationship between the UK and the EU.This is because the EU Commission deliberately set out to ensnare the UK in a tortuous bureaucratic process designed to leave us in the weakest position, bound to the EU as some sort of vassal state — as a rule-taker.In this, the EU has been emboldened by the appalling behaviour of the unelected House of Lords, which made it clear they want to reverse the result of the referendum. One peer even spoke arrogantly of now bringing the British people to heel.You only need to have watched as the EU’s negotiators have gratuitously and remorselessly set out not just to be difficult but, it has become clear, to humiliate us.For example, their refusal to agree to our continuing involvement in the Galileo satellite project, despite the fact that we have invested heavily in it, demonstrates how their behaviour has been calculated to offend.Even the UK’s offer of defence intelligence co-operation, which the EU needs, was brushed aside.That the EU is now strutting like the school bully should not surprise us, because of its ideological commitment to the European project at all costs.Yet, for all their bluster, this masks a weakness.The EU is deeply worried the UK will leave the EU and become a serious trade competitor, thus not only damaging the EU’s trading position but encouraging those in the EU who oppose this centralised, protectionist behemoth.We have reached a critical moment in the Brexit process. Because of the EU’s inflexibility, the Government has been forced to make concessions in the hope of discussing that all-important trade relationship.This has left many of us concerned that the process has been too one-sided.The UK has been behaving as a friend who wants an amicable divorce, while the EU has behaved like an opponent who wishes to impose their will and force the UK to repent what they believe is the folly of Brexit.That is why the UK needs now to change its negotiating stance, once the Brexit bill is passed.Too often it seems as though it is the UK which negotiates as a supplicant — despite the reality that, as the EU’s largest trade partner and the fifth largest economy in the world, with the world’s fourth most potent defence forces, the UK is deserving of much more respect from the EU.After all, there is a great deal at stake for the EU if these negotiations go wrong.There are many among the EU 27 who, like us, are growing weary of the EU’s arrogance. After all, it is many of them who stand to lose jobs if we fail to reach a trade arrangement.The EU Council meeting later this month has now become critical. It is there we should say that, notwithstanding any ongoing issues concerning the Irish border, our requirement is we move now to negotiate our post-Brexit trade relationship.If they refuse, and want instead to continue their border demands, then we must have the resolve to leave the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has a bell in his left foot. Theresa May seems to have a brain in her left foot. Given the choice, maybe I’d take the kid with the bell.We are in chaos. Not because we voted for Brexit, far from it. The economy is doing well. The sky has not fallen in. Investment up, employment hitting record levels, inflation down.No, the problem is solely a consequence of our Government. Right now we don’t know exactly what deals have been done with the rump of Remainers within the Conservative Party.One moment we’re told the Prime Minister has caved in to their demands. Next minute she hasn’t. Nobody knows quite what to believe.She is tip-toeing between the two sides solely to stay in power. And she has to be told: It isn’t working. It sends out a message to the people we are negotiating with that we haven’t a clue what’s going on.That policy is formulated on the hoof. In fact, it’s not policy at all, just inept fire-fighting. Inept because the flames are spreading — and as a result, our negotiating position becomes weaker by the hour.Some will argue May can only play the cards she has been dealt. That she has a minority Government and a split in her own party.Well, sure. But then, to a considerable degree, she dealt the cards herself. She called an election a year ago expecting to get a huge majority.I could have told her she would lose, if she’d asked. But she didn’t ask me, she asked some other numbnuts instead. This holy mess is of her making.Britain voted to leave the EU. Not to stay in bits of it. Not to remain constrained by the EU’s regulations. The Remainers don’t like that?Don’t care. You lost the argument — so shut up for a while. Or work to get us the best deal we can, outside the customs union.We need to be clear to the EU negotiators that we will happily take a no deal Brexit. They don’t want that — and a tough line will make them respond. If it doesn’t — fine, no deal is still much better than a bad deal.The EU is falling apart, largely for the reasons that convinced us to leave. Bullying, dictatorial, corrupt, undemocratic.We need a leader who can exploit their manifest weaknesses. A lot — perhaps a majority — of European people are on our side.That leader isn’t Theresa May. It needs to be someone within the Tories who is A. a Leave voter and B. has a bit of charisma and nous.I don’t really care who, right now, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Michael Gove.

What do Terry and Andraya possess that may have helped them come first and second?Jet-powered roller skates? Performance- enhancing drugs? Nope.They were both born with male bodies. And they both competed as boys until very recently.But according to the growing trend, they are now able to identify as girls without question. And so are allowed to compete against girls.And that’s what happens. They win because of biology.SHOULD the Royal Family be allowed to get their baps out? An important constitutional point.Meghan turned up for a royal engagement with her shoulders uncovered. And many people thought this was “inappropriate”. Only a matter of time before the female royals start trying to outdo each other.Kate in a glittery boob tube and Princess Anne in a leather basque with split-crotch undies.Bring it on.THE brilliant writer Lionel Shriver has been sacked as judge of a short story competition.This is because she objected to publishers having quotas that are supposed to “reflect diversity”.She said: “If an agent submits a manuscript written by a gay, ­trans- gender Caribbean who dropped out of school at seven and powers around town on a mobility scooter, it will be published.Whether or not . . . it is an incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed- paper recycling.”The magazine that runs the competition sacked her for this.It said her comments were “not consistent” with its ethos.What it means is it disagrees with her.Freedom of speech, huh. Well done, Shriver.IN Cretins Corner this week are the libtards criticising President Trump for his attempts to make peace with North Korea.Six months ago these same people were screaming that Trump was leading us all to death and destruction by threatening Kim Jong-un.Now he’s accused of cosying up to a horrible dictator.Truth is, he’s played it brilliantly. Acting tough brought the porky dog-muncher to the negotiating table.And now we have at least a chance of peace in the world’s second most dangerous area (after the Middle East, natch).Barack Obama was bunged a Nobel Peace Prize for, essentially, doing nothing, by the liberals who run the awards.How about one for The Donald for actually achieving something?IS Sadiq Khan going mad?The Mayor of London has demanded that Wikipedia must “close the gender gap” on its entries. Just 17 per cent of biographies on Wiki are about women, apparently.What’s it got to do with you, you bumptious midget?As someone cleverly tweeted, just zero per cent of Imams at Britain’s mosques are female – perhaps they should close the gender gap a little too.Listen Sadiq, just build a few more homes in the capital and stop young ethnic minority people macheteing or machine gunning each other to death.When you’ve sorted that out, mate, then maybe you can start worrying about American online publications.Listen, mate.

That’s a fundamental rule whether you’re buying a car or exiting a 45-year-old trading arrangement.Grieve and Soubry know that full well. They are lawyers. Their attempt to make it impossible is a ploy to keep us in a customs union, tied to the Single Market, and negate or block Brexit.Now they must decide whether doing Brussels’ dirty work, as they plainly are, trumps the survival of their own party. This current shambles, this paralysis, cannot go on. Britain is sick of it.Our PM, rightly attempting to fulfil the democratic mandate of the 17.4million majority (namely a Brexit that actually involves leaving), is being held to ransom.She has faced the Remainers down. Next week they have a massive decision. To let Mrs May do her duty...Or potentially destroy her, along with her Government and  their own jobs, while giving Corbyn’s crazies a chance to seize power.BRITAIN needs a sensible policy of controlled immigration, not some blinkered drive to hit an arbitrary limit at all costs.So we welcome Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s new approach.He intends to let in thousands more skilled medics to fill NHS rota gaps — and relax rules to let businesses take in more engineers and IT experts.And foreign, non-graduate entrepreneurs with a promising start-up idea will get a visa to launch it here.That is exactly what taking back  control of our borders should look like post-Brexit: welcoming in the brightest, while stemming the flow of the less skilled. That will benefit our economy and allow our communities to cope.It is far from the “racism” Leavers are accused of. It is simply common sense.ROBOTS, they say, will take all our jobs. But grey, unthinking automatons already run the Royal Mail.Refusing to print Brexit stamps was bad enough.

He said ‘well I’m one of them,’ and I asked him if he meant he was trans and he said he was.Although the transition at home was made easy for Gabriel, he still found going to school as a boy difficult.Melanie said he lacked the confidence to fully embrace his true self and would spend half his time as a boy, and the other at school as a girl.Eventually he became so anxious about going to school he locked himself in the bathroom - which forced Melanie to make a tough decision.She told Gabriel he could be home schooled, so he could be a boy all the time.The mum-of-six said her fifth youngest is now much happier and has a big group of friends who accepted the change no questions.Now, the family are waiting to get on the list for hormone blocking procedures, to stop puberty and allow Gabriel to fully become a boy."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004137382711.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"nick freeman upskirting law twitter gina martin","story":"Nick Freeman - dubbed Mr Loophole - made the comments after a bill to criminalise upskirting was blocked in parliament yesterday after being opposed by Tory MP Sir Christopher Chope.The Voyeurism (Offences) Bill would have made it illegal to take a picture under someones clothing without their consent.But Mr Freeman sparked outrage after claiming the new law would have drained police resources when women could be taking more responsibility for their attire.He said: Whilst this is totally unacceptable conduct, if women assumed some responsibility for their attire, they would not be in jeopardy.Prosecutions will only utilise valuable police and CPS resources that should be prioritised elsewhere.But his comments sparked a backlash on social media as the lawyer was accused of victim-blaming.Sam Elliott said: Wait, what?!

These things matter when you are 92.You have your favourite chair, tea cup and biscuits, and routine is important.Both of these women will have bonded during the overnight journey in the royal train to carry out engagements in ­Cheshire, with the Queen dispensing the solid, common sense advice she has learned the hard way after 66 years on the throne.They might be from ­completely different backgrounds and ­cultures but the Queen and Meghan do have a ­surprising amount in common.Obviously first and foremost they both share a deep love for Prince Harry, but they also have a real sense of duty and a desire to serve.Meghan has a lot more substance than the majority of self-centred young American actresses and, from an early age she has wanted to change the world for the better.This week she became an official partner in The Royal Foundation, joining William and Kate and husband Harry — all dubbed the “Fab Four” ­— to help charities close to their hearts.Meghan wants to make a difference. She doesn’t want to be just a clothes horse or to merely cut ribbons and unveil plaques, and I don’t believe she’d be ­content with just being a mum and virtual stay-at-home housewife like most upper-class wives. She wants to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in.Those who snarkily accuse her of self-promotion are missing the point.Meghan is canny enough to realise her new position in life means she will ­constantly be photographed and written and talked about.She knows that a new hairstyle or frock will steal the headlines but will hope people will also listen to what she has to say on poverty in Africa, equal rights for women and saving elephants.Meanwhile, her old life could be luring Meghan back to La La Land with news that her performance in Suits has been submitted for an Emmy award.A submission is a long way from a nomination, but it will be interesting to see if those in charge fast-track her into the awards category for best actress. ­Personally, I don’t think it will happen.Even Meghan would admit she wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best actor in Suits.If Meghan was nominated and ended up winning, it would be nothing more than a stunt to get some sort of seal of royal approval.Surely even the US entertainment industry wouldn’t be that cynical.Since Meghan met Harry, she has been compared to Grace Kelly, the Hollywood star who gave up her career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco.Unlike Grace Kelly, who wanted to go back into movies, I don’t see Meghan being in any way tempted back to her old life after landing the best role of all.That’s not a criticism because I admire her work ethic and single-mindedness — and I think her desire to be a force for good is genuine.The Queen is nobody’s fool and if she thinks Meghan is worth cultivating and training, the new ­American Duchess should have our approval, too.THE two new judges being wooed to join The X Factor could very well save this show’s rather tired-looking format.Robbie Williams is an inspired choice, bringing his own brand of cheeky humour but also a real empathy for all those seeking fame and fortune.I reckon, however, his wife Ayda could prove to be the real star.She’s funny, feisty and has proved to be a TV favourite during her appearances on Loose Women.Ayda won’t take any nonsense from the formidable Simon Cowell and, much as she loves Robbie, you can expect some straight-talking spats between them.Of course there are those who will say she’s only getting a seat on the judges’ panel because of her husband’s fame, but I reckon Ayda , left with Robbie, is more than up to the job and will be a much needed breath of fresh air on a panel that was looking increasingly bored and out of touch.ON World Blood Donor Day this week I repaid my debt to the NHS when my fantastic TV show team donated their very own blood (having already given their sweat and tears on a daily basis).I had to have a life-saving three pints of blood after a serious accident and, like every other patient who is given a transfusion, I am no longer allowed to donate my own.Where can I give blood? Here’s how to find a donation centre and how often you’re able to donateIt’s something that has made me feel very guilty, so I cannot thank my team enough – although there would have been even more of the precious life-saving blood if some of the boys who work with me and happen to be gay had not been banned from donating.Gay men who have had recent sex are not allowed to be donors, which surely is an edict that needs to be changed.There has to be a way to ensure safety without making gay men feel like pariahs.IN Hollywood, money talks and the box office dictates trends.So It’s good news that the all-female Ocean’s 8 has trounced the other male-dominated movies in the franchise, because it clearly shows moviegoers WILL happily pay to see films starring women in leading roles.Ocean’s 8 is a rather silly but hugely enjoyable spin on the heist movie with a satisfying end twist and decent parts for women – who are all too often usually “the wife” or “the best friend”.It shows that the appallingly bad all-girl version of Ghostbusters, a real stinker that bombed horribly, was just a blip.Hopefully, this will be the start of more big- budget films with kick-ass roles for women that aren’t twee or patronising.ALL my fellow Holby City fans know that surgeon Jac Naylor would make a polar bear shiver if she gave it one of her “looks”.She’s the ultimate ice maiden, although we have seen a little bit of a thaw in recent weeks on her return to our screens.In fact, Jac showed her human side when the character had a breakdown on screen, something that Rosie Marcel, who has played the character for 13 years, knows all about.Rosie told me that she suffered her own mental health problems after having a real-life breakdown on set.She suffered from depression and had to seek medical help.Rosie walked out of her house in her pyjamas and bare feet and even had the dark thought that her family would be better off without her.Luckily, she was given treatment and was able to get back to work, but it was a frightening time and demonstrates once again that mental health problems can hit anyone.I salute Rosie for being so open and brave about her struggle.FASTEN your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Poldark when the admirable Rebecca Front sails into Truro harbour like a magnificent galleon as the formidable Lady Whitworth.This ghastly harridan is the mother of the monstrous Ossie Whitworth, who has made his reluctant wife Morwenna suffer the torments of hell and even had his wicked way with her sister.If you wondered how Ossie could be so self-centred, heartless and cruel, then all will be explained when his mother heaves into view.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Six had been arrested a couple of months before, accused of belonging to a left-wing terror cell called \"Network\" which the FSB claims had branches in Penza, St Petersburg, Moscow and Belarus.The FSB say \"Network\" was planning to stage terror attacks during the presidential election and World Cup, in an attempt to overthrow the government.Some of those six say they were tortured, beaten and electrocuted by agents of the FSB.They claim they were forced into making confessions and that weapons and explosives were placed in their cars. Like Mr Filinkov, they deny any charge of preparing acts of terror.Mr Filinkov met his wife Aleksandra through anti-fascist circles. He was at Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg en route to visit her in Kiev, Ukraine when he was detained.She has now fled to Finland where she is seeking political asylum.:: British LGBT campaigner Peter Tatchell detained by Russian police \"This is what they threatened Viktor with\", she told Sky News in a park in Helsinki.\"They told me they would get me even in Kiev.\"Aleksandra is convinced that Mr Filinkov and the others made for easy targets.\"It is a usual thing that there are mass political cleansings of opposition activists before large events\", she says.\"This time the anti-fascists and anarchists got caught in the crossfire.\"Human rights campaigners agree.Aleksandra Krylenkova, from the civil rights group Memorial, said: \"The FSB need to show their effectiveness and how good they are at preventing terrorist acts.\"In order to do that they need people who first of all won\u0027t be protected by anyone, whose innocence will be doubted, and who have previously been on police or FSB lists.\" Ilya Kapustin was the one who got away.He too is a self-described anti-fascist, though like Aleksandra he is not altogether clear on what that means for him.Both are adamant it does not mean violence. He\u0027s also seeking asylum in Helsinki.\"Some of the questions were asked again and again, five or 10 times.\"I felt every bit of my body had severe convulsions. It all lasted for approximately three hours until finally they threatened to break my legs and to throw me out of the minibus into the woods to freeze to death.\"Russia\u0027s investigative committee which is supposed to be concerned with such matters has dismissed his case.They say they can\u0027t be sure the marks he\u0027d photographed from immediately after the alleged torture aren\u0027t insect bites and have refused to open a criminal inquiry.The FSB, Russia\u0027s investigative committee and the prosecutor\u0027s office have all deferred any kind of response to our requests for comment.It is not a point blank refusal. It is more \"we must consult another department\" or \"within a month\".You can be sure that won\u0027t be until after the World Cup ends. Russia\u0027s moment in the sun must not be sullied by the likes of this. Mr Filinkov\u0027s lawyer has an air of resignation when he talks about the case.\"If you look back for any information about an FSB officer who was arraigned on criminal charge for tortures or abuses over the last 20 years, you won\u0027t find a single one,\" Mr Cherkasov says.He had hoped during the Dmitry Medvedev presidency, which ushered in increased scrutiny and prosecutions of cases of police torture, that things would improve.\"But then Putin came back to power,\" he says.\"There was a reshuffle and things got worse. We can see it has become extremely hard to initiate a criminal case against a police officer and impossible to do so against an FSB officer - they are seemingly untouchable.\"Mr Cherkasov says he will try and take Mr Filinkov\u0027s case to the European Court of Human Rights if his conviction of plotting to launch terrorist acts is upheld.I ask Memorial\u0027s Aleksandra Krylenkova whether as a human rights campaigner in Russia she feels she is fighting a losing battle.\"When we come home in the evening we are not sure if we are being watched or going to be detained,\" she says.\"But the more danger there is, the more active people become. They are ready to protect their rights and I can see a positive change in that.\"We are set for a month of unbridled fun.

Many offer playgrounds or activities like climbing and zipwires. And lots have cycle-friendly paths for off-road bike trips.

In his early years Gabriel Buttress, who was born as Charlotte, loved parading around in dresses. However he soon realised he was supposed to live life as the opposite sex, Hull Live reports. Gabriel is now waiting to undergo a hormone blocking procedure, which is hoped to stop puberty to allow him to transition into a boy. His mum, Melanie Palmer-Scaum, said: When he was younger he used to ask for party dresses at Christmas and he would twirl around in them.  “But about two years ago we were in this shop looking for girls’ clothes and he said ‘I don’t want to shop here mum.’ “He has four brothers so I thought it might be to do with that but then he said he wanted his hair cut short.  He was never brave enough to but then a year later he got it cut all around the sides and short on top. “As soon as the clipper touched his head he had the biggest grin on his face and that was when I had a little bit of an inkling.”  According to the mum-of-six, Gabriel had always been a bit of a tomboy. He had long hair which he would never let his mum do anything with and he would never let her put make-up on his face. However, the 35-year-old did not put that down to him being trapped in the wrong body and she was left surprised when she received a text from him in February which revealed his true thoughts and feelings. “Gabriel texted me from his dad’s house. He said ‘do you know what LGBT is?’ And I didn’t know what it was. He said ‘well I’m one of them,’ and I asked him if he meant he was trans and he said he was. “Even though I had an inkling I was still a little shocked and it took me a couple of days to get my head around it. It was a shock and it took time for it to sink in and for me to get used to calling Gabriel a him.”  Very quickly, Mrs Palmer-Scaum realised her daughter wanting to identify as male was not a big deal. He lived happily as Gabriel at home but going to secondary school proved to be problematic. “He didn’t have the confidence to be Gabriel at school. At home he was a full-time boy but at school he was having to put knickers on. He was having to go to school and pretend to be a girl. “He had a few people ask him ‘are you a boy or a girl?’ but he just didn’t have the confidence to come out at school and his anxiety got really bad. “He was crying before he went and when he got there he was ringing me in tears feeling panicky and anxious.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brian reade brex pistols tour","story":"NewsopinionBrian Reade: Brex Pistols on tour show the contempt they have for BritainNigel Lawson has applied for a French residency card so his idyllic life in his Gascony villa remains unaffected while Jacob Rees-Mogg has moved part of his investment firm Somerset Capital Management to Ireland to escape the inevitable ­financial cost of Brexit\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBrian Reade19:18, 15 JUN 2018NewsopinionArron Banks flounced out of his grilling by MPs (Image: AFP)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI don\u0027t know about you but I’m still chortling at the wacky antics of those self-styled Bad Boys Of Brexit in the Commons this week.

Banks is the ex-public schoolboy-turned-multi-millionaire insurance salesman and diamond mine owner, who siphoned profits to offshore tax havens, yet funded Vote Leave as he’s a patriot who hates the rich global elites. Go figure. And now the reality of the shambles he did so much to create becomes clear he says he might walk away because “the referendum stuff is slowly grinding towards a conclusion in the most painful, horrible way”.

Sir Christopher Chope yesterday triggered uproar after blocking the progress of a bill that would have made taking \u0027upskirt\u0027 photos a specific criminal offence by talking for four hours. He was aided by Shipley MP Philip Davies as a raft of other legislation was also blocked. The pair are said to dislike backbench bids to reform the law and challenge them because they see it as their moral crusade. According to Sky News , the pair, on the libertarian Right of the Conservative Party, regard many private members\u0027 bills as politically correct, nanny state nonsense seeking to meddle in people\u0027s lives and curb their personal freedom. The pair have frequently taken advantage of an archaic quirk of Commons rules in which MPs are prevented from voting on a bill on a Friday if the debate goes on past 2.30pm. There is no time limit on members\u0027 speeches on a Friday, effectively allowing them to talk for as long as they want.  Their marathon speeches were during the first debate of the day, on a bill to tighten regulation on the use of force in Mental Health Units. Tory grandee Chope, 71, the MP for Christchurch in Dorset, shouted down the Voyeurism (Offences) Bill at the second reading stage in the Commons on Friday, prompting derision from his Conservative colleagues and campaigners alike. MPs cried shame as progress of the bill, which has cross-party support and is backed by the Government, was delayed until at July. Other bills that were blocked included a bill to ban buses and coaches from using tyres more than 10 years old a bill to extend Freedom of Information laws to contractors working on public projects and housing associations a bill to abolish hospital car parking charges a bill to ban unpaid workplace trial periods and a bill to tighten regulation on the use of force in Mental Care Units. Sir Christopher failed to respond to repeated attempts by the Press Association to comment. Theresa May has now moved to soothe anger at the actions of one of her party\u0027s longest-serving MPs.  The Prime Minister, who last month signalled her support for the campaign to ban people from taking pictures up someone\u0027s clothing without their consent, pledged the Government would back moves to get the anti-upskirting legislation through Parliament. The PM expressed her disappointment that the private member\u0027s Bill, which would have made upskirting a criminal offence in its own right, was delayed in the Commons. Mrs May said: Upskirting is an invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed. I am disappointed the Bill didn\u0027t make progress in the Commons today, and I want to see these measures pass through Parliament - with Government support - soon. The Government earlier said it had every expectation upskirting will become illegal, despite Sir Christopher\u0027s actions in opposing a law that would prohibit the craze. Former minister Sir Christopher was heckled with cries of shame! as he deployed his oft-used tactic of opposing backbench private members\u0027 bills by simply shouting an objection moments after the Bill was called.  But Justice Minister, Lucy Frazer said she was confident Sir Christopher\u0027s actions would not scupper the Bill in the long term, although the Ministry of Justice stopped short of setting a time frame on when it would become law. She said: We are committed to making sure upskirting becomes a criminal offence and have every expectation that this will happen. The Voyeurism (Offences) Bill had its second reading on Friday, which, after the Government announced its support following months of legal wrangling with campaigners, would have seen the worst offenders jailed for two years for taking an image under someone\u0027s clothing. Victims said a specific law prohibiting the craze was necessary as current legislation was often insufficient to prosecute an offender. Gina Martin, an upskirting victim whose petition to criminalise the act won her a legion of celebrity supporters and political backing, said the decision left her extremely upset but that she remained positive. David Gauke, the Justice Secretary who collaborated with Ms Martin over her campaign, echoed the dismay within the Conservatives. He said: The Government supported today\u0027s Bill on \u0027up-skirting\u0027. Disappointed that no progress today - the law needs to be reformed. But it will be. Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem MP who introduced the Bill after lobbying Sir Christopher on the back benches in the moments before he delivered the crushing blow, said she was angry, frustrated and disappointed. London mayor Sadiq Khan said he was dismayed and appalled at the action, while Tory MP Bob Neill said he has written to the Prime Minister asking that government time be made available to the allow the Voyeurism (Offences) Bill to have its second reading. Moments after blocking the upskirting Bill, Sir Christopher also opposed Finn\u0027s Law, Government-backed plans to give police dogs and horses extra legal protections from attack, and also talked out attempts to reform mental health units. The session caused such outrage it was trending on Twitter in the UK.

The government won\u0027t allow Mohammed Cham into the country after his application for a temporary visa was denied.  The eight-year-old was due to fly from his native Gambia to Scotland next week to have an implant inserted into his ear during surgery.  The charity Project Gambia People Feeding People had arranged the trip and is now urging the government to reconsider its decision, the Daily Record reports.   Mohammed, also known as Alieu, was left in tears after being told the British Embassy in Gambia had blocked his visa application. The charity, which provides meals and hearing aids at St John’s School for the Deaf in the Gambian village Serekunda, spent 16 months planning the trip. They had arranged for NHS Lanarkshire ENT specialist surgeon Arunachalam Iyer to carry out the surgery at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie. Project chairman Frank Devine said: “We’re desperate to help this poor wee soul but we’re being stopped by people playing God.  “It’s an absolute disgrace that we are letting down a child who just wants the chance to be able to hear like everyone else. “When he was told he wasn’t allowed to come to Scotland, he burst into tears. He’s broken-hearted and doesn’t understand why we can’t help him anymore. “It’s cruel and cold. People making these decisions sometimes need to look at the person and what being allowed to come here will mean to them. “Life should not be governed by a rulebook. He’s been so excited about coming over and now, through no fault of his own, it’s not happening. “Dr Iyer is one of our biggest supporters and has already supplied deaf children across West Africa with 15,000 hearing aids. He kindly agreed to see wee Alieu and was planning to operate on him.”  Frank insists the charity followed every procedure on the visa application and were stunned to discover it had been knocked back. Mohammed, who was born deaf, was due to travel to Scotland with his deputy head teacher Mary Ann Allen and Project Gambia volunteer Alasan Canara, with all three set to be surprise guests of honour at the charity’s summer ball. They were due to stay with Frank’s project partner, Paul Lafferty, at his home in Bellshill during their visit. Frank, 57, from Mossend, said: “Everything was in place and we never thought there would be any issues with visas. “We followed every procedure to the letter and spent a month in Gambia working on the application. “They knocked us back because we never told them the name of the surgeon and because we didn’t mention the hospital that the operation was to be performed in – but we were never asked to provide that information.  “Why refuse visa applications with stipulations we as a charity were never asked to adhere to? We answered every question asked of us. “These questions were never posed and if they were, we would have answered them. To refuse the visa application on those grounds is a joke. “We just wanted to help give a child the chance to hear again but it’s being made so difficult. “We promised wee Alieu we would get him sorted and we keep our promises – always.” Dr Iyer was due to operate on the youngster in the coming weeks and planned to insert an implant which would restore his hearing. He said: “We have put a lot of effort into confirming his suitability for a hearing aid as he has no ear canal. “The next step would be a bone anchored hearing aid and that’s what I was planning to do when he arrived in Scotland.

Caffe Nero staff allegedly denied the request of blind man Olliver Gibbons, 40. He has claimed he told them his Golden Labrador Sydney had been guiding him around the seaside town.  The coffee chain says it is now investigating the incident at its Exmouth branch, Devon Live reports.   The chain said it was not company policy to refuse guide dogs water.   Olliver\u0027s friend Helen Fox, who helps him live independently, told the Exmouth Journal : I said, ‘he’s a guide dog’, but they just said ‘no’ and walked off.  “It was really hot, he had been working and we had just taken him off the harness for a free run.  “I was taken aback – any dog should be allowed a drink, but he is also a working dog. “Ollie doesn’t want to go back again. It made him quite sad, really. He was asking why they were being like that.” Sydney eventually got a drink at Tempus the Jeweller in Albion Street. Guide Dogs South West spokesman Clive Wood said: “It’s very disappointing that the staff in this Caffe Nero made a decision to deny providing water to this gentleman’s guide dog on such a warm day. It’s disappointing that the level of customer service fell lower than expected from a national chain.” An RSPCA spokesperson said: “It’s extremely concerning to hear that a coffee shop refused to provide drinking water for a service dog whose handler was a customer. We would expect all businesses to show kindness and compassion towards all animals, but particularly to service dogs.

However the Cheshire-based lawyer, dubbed \u0027Mr Loophole\u0027 for his record in helping famous clients such as Chris Tarrant and Paddy McGuinness dodge motoring offences, his comments were not sexist.  It comes after Tory MPs Philip Davies and Sir Christopher Chope intentionally blocked progress on establishing an upskirting ban by talking for four hours.  In so doing, the pair took advantage of an archaic quirk of Commons rules in which MPs are prevented from voting on a bill on a Friday if the debate goes on past 2.30pm.  Mr Freeman tweeted a link to a  article reporting how upskirting was to become a criminal offence punishable by up to two years in prison, the Manchester Evening News reported.  He suggested convicting such offenders would be a waste of police time and CPS resources. He wrote: Whilst this is totally unacceptable conduct, if women assumed some responsibility for their attire, they would not be in jeopardy.  “Prosecutions will only utilise valuable police and CPS resources that should be prioritised elsewhere. #upskirting.” While Mr Freeman conceded that upskirting is deplorable conduct, he suggested such a crime should be dealt with at a magistrates\u0027 court and described a maximum sentence of six months as more than enough. He said this was due to many victims of the crime being unaware of it taking place. “Upskirting in my view should be a criminal offence, but it’s important to remember that the vast majority of people this happens to are entirely unaware of it.” He went on to compare a woman wearing a skirt to a homeowner leaving the back door open. Both come with consequences, he said. “Women are absolutely right to wear exactly what they want. I would expect that right.  “That’s a choice that they make in the same way a householder has the absolute right to go out and leave the back door open. “They exercise their right but with these rights come likely consequences, he said. He went on: We have to take some responsibility for the way we present ourselves and the way we behave and the more provocative the attire the greater the likelihood and the greater risk of someone wanting to have a sneaky view. In order to avoid being photographed by a predator, you should dress more conservatively and more modestly, he said. He added: If you dress in a provocative and tempting manner it will undoubtedly titillate the sexual perverts out there who will want to have a peek. “You reduce this chance dressing down a little and being aware. That’s all I’m saying. I can’t really understand what’s so wrong with that.” The lawyer was blasted by his Twitter followers.

The 85-metre (280ft) Tecoil Polaris was heading into Immingham, North East Lincolnshire , when the alarm was raised. Alarmed dock workers were so concerned about its safety they alerted the authorities - before it had even docked. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency inspected the ship and found a catalogue of \u0027potentially disastrous\u0027 safety breaches and banned it from sailing. It was seized on the Humber.  The tanker\u0027s captain Vitaliy Trofimov has been accused of showing \u0027complete disregard for the safety of his vessel and crew\u0027, the Grimsby  reports.   Captain Trofimov has now been fined \u0026pound25,000 after pleading guilty to breaching international shipping codes. The breaches were so serious it could have posed potentially disastrous human and environmental consequences, Hull Magistrates Court heard. The agency uncovered a catalogue of deficiencies in navigation and safety equipment, together with significant non-compliance with the international safety code. The defects included not having correct navigation charts or voyage plan, incorrect stability calculations, navigation equipment not working and defects with lifesaving equipment. Vitaliy Trofimov will have to pay more than \u0026pound25,000 after pleading guilty to breaching the International Safety Management (ISM) Code while in charge of the tanker in the Humber estuary.  The Tecoil Polaris arrived in the Humber on the evening of June 5 after a trip from Hamina in Finland. It had been due to be loaded with 1,665 tonnes of lubrication oil - but staff Humber Port Authority, ABP, reported concerns about the master and the crew’s competency as the vessel approached and berthed at Immingham Docks. The vessel was inspected by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) the following morning. It was subsequently detained and its safety certificate cancelled. On Tuesday it sailed across the Humber to Hull were it is now detained in Albert Dock Upon investigation and questioning by MCA officials, Captain Trofimov admitted the failures and deficiencies. He was fined \u0026pound1,400 and ordered to pay \u0026pound24,361.99 costs during a hearing at Hull Magistrates Court on Thursday. Sentencing, the district judge said: Many of the failures were down to yourself. You are responsible for all those onboard and those on the high seas, that is why this is high culpability.

The former Suits actress, now the Duchess of Sussex, has to follow strict dietary rules following her wedding to Prince Harry last month. Royal Butler Grant Harrold has revealed the royal family do not eat seafood out of fear of getting food poisoning. He told the Express : “It is a very sensible move to abandon having seafood when out and about on public duties. “We don\u0027t want a member of the Royal family having a serious reaction to food poisoning, especially if she is on an overseas tour.”  No doubt Meghan was disappointed by this restriction in her diet as she has previously spoken about her love of seafood. The 36-year-old told The New Potato magazine that her ideal food day would involve lots of seafood. She said: “A leisurely dinner of seafood and pasta, and a negroni to cap off the night.” However, seafood isn\u0027t in the only restriction as other luxurious dishes are also banned.  Mr Harrold added: “As well as shellfish, it would also be quite appropriate for foods such as foie gras to be avoided.” Andrew Farquharson, Deputy Master at Clarence House, also told the  : “The Prince of Wales has a policy that his chefs should not buy foie gras.” This is believed to be due to animal welfare concerns rather than a dietary restriction. Other rules Meghan now has to follow include not being allowed to vote, no selfies, no autographs and she must always travel with a black outfit in case a member of the royal family dies. Meghan is still getting used to royal protocol and yesterday she had to ask the Queen for advice during their first engagement together in Cheshire.

It\u0027s the second time Lord Ivar will say his vows, and in an incredible sign of support his first wife Penny will give him away on the day. The couple are planning a very small ceremony with just very close family and friends present. But afterwards there will be a big party with about 120 guests to celebrate their marriage.  Lord Ivar and Penny divorced eight years ago but they are still extremely close. When he revealed he was gay Lord Ivar admitted he struggled with his sexuality throughout their 16 year marriage.

He\u0027s spoken about how supportive his friends and family have been, and how welcoming they\u0027ve been to James.   Speaking to the Daily Mail , he said: I had a really happy childhood but I could never tell my parents I was gay. Where I grew up, gay men were called poofs, queers, everything derogatory under the sun.  In 15, 20 years\u0027 time people will struggle to understand how we came to be having such conversations. People will look back and say, \u0027What\u0027s the big deal?\u0027 But for our generation it was. Penny added: What I don\u0027t think Ivar realises is how much he has changed as a man since he \u0027came out\u0027. James is hugely responsible for that because he\u0027s so much fun.  Lord Ivar and James, who met on a skiing holiday, will marry in a private chapel on their county estate in Devon.

Warning signs have also been posted around the building telling travellers: Please do not lay down on the seats. The Essex airport brought in the new policy amid claims that hundreds of passengers were camping out overnight - some of them on hammocks or blow-up beds.  But it isn\u0027t going down well with passengers, who say the move is unfair and mean to tired travellers. Under the lock-out policy, which began on Monday, the departures wing is closed after the final flight of the night. It remains shut from midnight until 2am, meaning anyone arriving at the budget flight airport during that time is directed to the arrivals area. They can take a seat and rest there, but they are banned from having a nap on the floor.  Guards are on patrol to wake up those who are fast asleep. Passengers who book early morning flights have been told not to arrive sooner than their scheduled check-in time. Stansted said it has seen up to 600 people camp out in the terminal overnight. Some travellers would rather sleep on the terminal floor instead of a local hotel, where rooms can cost upwards of \u0026pound140 a night. They can hamper overnight work or get in the way of passengers arriving later in the morning.

Wa Tiba\u0027s children became concerned when she failed to return to her home in Southeast Sulawesi Thursday, June 14. A search party was launched the next morning in a desperate bid to find the 54-year-old - and her sandals, machete and torch were later found 30 metres from a patch of bushes. Nothing could have prepared Wa Tiba\u0027s sons for what happened next. The pair discovered an enormous python on the ground, barely able to move due to an enormous bulge in its belly after it had swallowed the housewife head first.  Resident Ayu Kartika said: Everybody was crying, everybody was shocked. The poor woman. This is like a horror movie. People are terrified. We are scared to go outside. We can only pray for a safety. The frantic lads called police and by 9am hundreds of villagers had gathered round the patch of grass in the remote Mabolu Village in the Lohia Regency of Muna province.  Nightmarish footage captured the moment the snake\u0027s skin was sliced open to reveal the slime-covered corpse of the housewife. She was still wearing her brown leggings and dark red top.  While the knife that Wa Tiba had gone out with the previous evening was found on the floor - suggesting she had dropped it after being struck with deadly power by the killer python. Her head was towards the snake\u0027s tail and her feet at its mouth - showing that she had been swallowed head first.  Police superintendent Agung Ramos from the Muna district Indonesian National Police said Wa Tiba had went out to check her garden the previous evening and never returned. He said: Children and residents had been looking for Wa after she did not return home. Some items belonging to victim, sandals, machete, and flashlights, were found but the victim was not there. The family then reported this to the police and the search reached its conclusion at 9am. Residents found a python that looked like it was unable to move. Residents then suspected the snake swallowed Wa Tiba.  People took the snake into the village and started splitting the snake. The suspicions were true and there was a body in tact inside the snake. Unfortunately the victim was lifeless. Wa Tiba had a traditional burial ceremony later that afternoon in keeping with traditional religious customs.  Sulawesi is an island in Indonesia that is home to some of the biggest and most deadly wild pythons in the world. In March last year, a young farmer was found dead having also been swallowed by an enormous killer snake.  Footage showed him being cut from the python\u0027s stomach after going missing the night before while harvesting on a rubber plantation.

One passenger Yulia said: “Before landing those who were sitting near the wing did see smoke. “The speed was high, the plane was strongly shaking. “Everything was moving here and there, I had to push my legs hard against the seat in the front. “We were touching the tarmac already knowing that either a wing or a turbine was on fire. “We careered off the runway to the field. We were turning round, the wing began to scratch the ground, the wheels came off. “ Strong smoke came out, very pungent. She added: “We were the first to jump up from our seat and rushed to stewards. We asked – what happened? Is it ok now? She replied – perfect, run ahead, jump out! We ripped out the doors, those front doors near the cockpit, and began to run out. Everyone crowded near one exit.

We’ve got one retiring at Baldragon and we’ve filled that.“You’d think that they (Labour) would know that, considering that elected members sit on the panel to determine head teachers. It’s fair to say the position is getting better compared to a few years ago.“The posts that are unfilled at the moment will be filled. It’s not a case where we’ll just not replace anyone.“We’ve got applicants and candidates for every position. That’s not to say that they are all necessarily the right candidates and we still have to go through the interview process along with all the correct checks to prove that they are suitable.”Mr Malone believes vacant posts are having an adverse impact on closing the attainment gap in Dundee and called on the administration to “up its game” or risk “complete failure”.He added: “If we are to meet targets for enhancing the learning experience and closing the attainment gap, then we need to ensure our schools have the resources necessary for every child to get the educational opportunities they deserve.“Also, that our teachers can receive the support necessary to continue their efforts to deliver high-quality teaching without any undue stress due to staffing shortages.“Tighter financial controls would have allowed the council to free up money to deliver an incentive to attract the subject teachers.“The administration rejected Labour’s proposals at budget time that would have delivered a golden hello to the subject teachers we need to attract.“More financial control by the administration could have delivered so much more and resolved the problem we currently have in attracting teachers.”But Councillor Murray said Labour’s alternative was unviable, adding: “Other councils have done that but that’s not the route I want to go down.“It doesn’t work. It becomes an arms race where one authority can offer more than the other.“It doesn’t create any more staff and it’s just a waste of public money.“I’ve only been in the position for 12 months and it’s definitely been a lot easier this year finding staff.“I think a lot of it is down to there being more confidence in the city.“We’re doing a lot of work with Dundee University for people who can’t afford to quit their jobs to apply for teaching vacancies in city schools and that’s been positive.“There’s certainly no shortage of people applying.“We’ve been inundated particularly with people wanting to become head teachers, which is a good thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b238ed81901b-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee va could host weddings as approval given to sell booze","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe V\u0026ampA Dundee museum could host events as varied as weddings and casino nights, its operators have revealed.The details emerged during a meeting of the council’s licensing board, during which the gallery made its case to sell booze for consumption both on and off the premises.The museum’s operation plan, distributed ahead of the meeting, revealed V\u0026ampA bosses hope to stage live music, dance performances, film screenings, private events and casino nights.Janet Hood, representing the V\u0026ampA at the board meeting, said this could even stretch to include weddings.She said: “As I am sure you are all aware, there is a cafe in the foyer.

the favourites last season to top the table but fell well short of champions St Mirren.This time around, it promises to be even more difficult with two teams coming down from the Premiership.Starting with those two, let’s have a look at the Tangerines’ main challengers this coming season.Partick ThistleThe Jags became only the second top-tier side to lose out in the play-offs and are among the favourites to go straight back up.Alan Archibald has stayed on at Firhill and is rebuilding his side for the Championship.How strong they are remains to be seen but the experienced duo of Chris Erskine and Kris Doolan will be big factors in any success they have.Ross CountyAlso coming down, the Staggies aren’t hanging about putting together a team that can win the division.Co-managers Stuart Kettlewell and Steven Ferguson are determined to make their first chance in management a success.County will be a tough nut to crack for most teams in the Championship.Inverness CTCaley Thistle were expected to be Dundee United’s main challengers last season but got off to an awful start.Boss John Robertson turned things around and a late surge almost saw them into the play-offs.Expect that good form to continue in the new campaign.DunfermlineAllan Johnston’s 2017/18 team has been ripped apart with players leaving left, right and centre.With a lot of work to be done in the transfer market at the moment, another finish in the play-offs looks unlikely but Johnston has a history of getting his sides into the top four.FalkirkFormer Dundee manager Paul Hartley is slowly making the Bairns side his own after big changes in the winter and more to come this summer.Way off the pace last season, another mediocre campaign won’t be acceptable for the Falkirk faithful.MortonFormer United boss Ray McKinnon is just in the door at Cappielow and is busy bringing in players.His aim is the play-offs – Jim Duffy was sacked for not making them – so pressure is on.Queen of the SouthThe Doonhamers haven’t done much business this summer, the arrival of Gary Harkins apart, and will have to tighten up their defence if they are to cause any trouble at the top end of the division in the new

yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Saturday 16 Jun 2018 4:35

way to go.\"Words such as equality, diversity and compassion feature on the banner.\"These are things which they feel we are still working towards \u0026ndash and not just for women,\" she said.The

MacNeil said.\"They all brought something different to the project.\"They all had their own perspective which added to the dialogue because of their own life experiences.\"She also felt it had enabled new links and friendships to be formed.\"I think the main thing they enjoyed was that it was a collaboration,\" she said.\"It was not just one group which meets regularly \u0026ndash it was two groups coming together.\"They enjoyed meeting new people from the other group.\"They also enjoyed the opportunity to work with a professional artist who helped them to develop new ideas.

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here and we know what works in this area.\"We just need the right level of support.\"Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \"Things are really moving forward in the area and people seem happy with where we are going.\"As councillors, we need to be out there speaking to the community, and letting people know that they can come to us.\"Many strands of the plan are due to get under way imminently, with moves to review current provision for unemployed people set to start in August. The findings will be used to determine future actions.Longer term plans for a \"bespoke early leavers programme\", which includes ensuring all early school leavers have an individual work coach, are set to be in place by July next year.Saturday 16 Jun 2018 4:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111983.jpg","title":"New school campus is given the green light","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to create a badly-needed new school campus in a growing Inverness neighbourhood have been given the green light to the delight of community leaders.Highland councillors approved proposals to transform the existing Merkinch Primary School and nursery into a facility fit for the 21st century including all-weather sports pitches which will be available to the local community.It will also incorporate the Merkinch Family Centre which will relocate from its base in Coronation Park.The school is presently housed in cramped accommodation in a 132-year-old category B-listed building with extensions plus portable classrooms in the playground.Under the plans, which are broadly supported by the community, a new two-storey extension in a contemporary design will be built to accommodate the primary school and nursery.There will also be an adjoining single-storey double height sports block, play areas, informal/social courtyard spaces and garden areas.The relocated family centre, school dining hall and community sports studios will be housed in the original school building which will be refurbished while previous extensions will be demolished.Inverness Central councillor Richard Laird outlined the challenges of the development site when he spoke at the council\u0027s south planning applications committee meeting on Tuesday.\"To describe this as simply expanding a new school understates what the council is seeking to do,\" he said.The SNP representative said the integrated campus would provide services from the very early years right through primary school.Cllr Laird felt the designs addressed a range of existing issues including the grassed playing area which he described as an \"unusable bog\" at certain times of the year plus road safety concerns over traffic on Telford Road where the present school entrance is located.He also felt the location of the proposed two-storey extension in the centre of the site presented no risk of overshadowing Carse Road.\"I think what we have is a very elegant solution to a number of challenges,\" he said.\"This is a project which has almost unanimous support in the Merkinch community.\"Speaking after the meeting, fellow ward councillor Bet McAllister was \"over the moon\" the plans had been given the go ahead.\"It will make a huge difference to the community,\" the Labour representative said.\"It is a lovely school. Unfortunately, it is very small and it gets very over-crowded.\"The children and teachers deserve a place to meet modern-day learning needs while the outdoor facilities will benefit the whole community.\"I think everyone will be delighted.\"Dell McClurg, chairman of Merkinch Community Council, also welcomed the news but had reservations over the loss of some open space which will be replaced with all-weather pitches.\"We need a new school but I think there should be an ad hoc area for children to go and play and kick a football about for half-an-hour,\" she said.\"They don\u0027t always want organised football matches.\"David Paulin, Active Merkinch manager, said informal green spaces would still exist while more sporting activities could be available.\"This creates separate play areas from casual use areas which can end up covered in dog mess and covered in rubbish,\" he said.Saturday 16 Jun 2018 4:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04113000/04113978.jpg","title":"Seaside town could make a splash as Nairn facelift is considered","story":"\u0026nbspNAIRN could be about to make a big splash with ambitious proposals for an open-air swimming pool, replacement paddling pool, possibility of a miniature railway and dolphin emblem all in the pipeline.Councillors will consider a blueprint for a radical facelift for the town\u0027 links when they meet today.The four-member Nairnshire Committee will discuss a detailed scoping report and be asked to approve a public consultation on the ideas.The links area is owned by the Nairn Common Good Fund and managed by Highland Council.A debate began in earnest two years ago when the council\u0027 leisure division High Life Highland, which manages the paddling pool, pinpointed a need for significant repairs.Councillors approved repairs but noted the paddling pool was approaching an end to its operational life.Public consultation last year found that revitalising the wider area was equally important.A human touch is guaranteed. Funds raised in memory of local schoolboy Hamish Hey (8) will contribute to the process of shaping the links.The Team Hamish charity, established in memory of the young cancer victim, has raised more than \u0026pound50,000. Relatives want residents to share their thoughts at the charity\u0027 own consultation event next Wednesday (7.30-9pm) in the town\u0027 community and arts centre.It is working with the council and the Nairn Improvement Community Enterprise to create a disabled-friendly links recreation area.The council wants to promote use of the links to \"build on the special nature of the area and add to the historic value of the links as a visitor destination\".Consultation already carried out showed strong support for replacing the paddling pool with \"an alternative form of water play\". People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Saturday 16 Jun 2018 4:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114012.jpg","title":"The street has no name six years on","story":"\u0026nbspTHE hunt is on for a name for an Inverness street \u0026ndash after a six-year wait.The road that runs through Milton of Leys has never been named.Highland Council said it was agreed as far back as 2012 that naming the street \"would not be beneficial as it was not providing access to a particular address\".But the council has changed tack after a complaint from the ward\u0027\u0026nbspNon-Aligned Highland councillor Ken Gowans.He said residents were experiencing difficulties directing delivery drivers and added: \"If you had a bad accident on that road how would you identify your position? \"That road is a main thoroughfare that goes right the way down Milton of Leys.

It just shows the fine margins in football.“Switzerland are a very good side but over in Basel in the second leg (0-0) I thought we were far better.“We created the better chances and on another time it could have been our night.“Looking back we probably shot ourselves in the foot as we were maybe a bit more cautious at home than we usually are.”With no World Cup action McGinn has opted to return to Pittodrie a week earlier than the rest of the squad to ensure he can make an immediate impact in the new campaign.Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round on July 26 and discover their opponents in Wednesday’s draw.McGinn said: “I had a frustrating end to the last campaign picking up a few niggly injuries but I’ve had a good break now which has been really beneficial.“We come back near the end of June but I’m going in around a week prior to that to give myself time with the physios before I go back into full training.“I want to get myself ready to go and am determined to do well for the team.“I’m really excited about the season as we have European football and I really look forward to those games at the start of the campaign.“Hopefully we can do well in the Europa League then make a strong start domestically, which can build belief we can have another good season.”This summer though McGinn and his Northern Ireland team-mates will be left considering what could have been after the disappointment of the play-off loss to the Swiss.In the first leg at Windsor Park last November Ricardo Rodriguez scored the only goal of the play-off from the spot after Corry Evans was adjudged to have handled.The ball clearly struck the defender’s shoulder.It prevented Northern Ireland a second straight finals appearance having advanced to the Euro 2016 knock-out phase in the nation’s first appearance at a major finals since World Cup 1986.“Having experienced the Euros and all that followed from that tournament it is very frustrating not to be at the World Cup,” said McGinn.“It was an unbelievable experience and I saw just how much it meant to the people of Northern Ireland and that group of players.“To go to another tournament would have been incredible, especially the World Cup.”Following the World Cup play-offs the SFA made a botched attempt to secure Northern Ireland boss O’Neill as replacement for Gordon Strachan whose contract was not renewed.O’Neill rejected the SFA’s advances and opted to sign a new contract until 2024.“It is one of those ones where we didn’t qualify so we just have to keep moving forward,” said McGinn.“We are happy the manager has stayed and things are very positive in Northern Ireland at the moment.”The play-off disappointment had added poignancy for McGinn as he watched it from the other side of the world in South Korea having moved to Gwangju after rejecting a new deal at Pittodrie at the end of the 2016-17 season.The switch to the K League did not work out as he dropped out of the international reckoning and struggled to get regular game time at Gwangju.He said: “I was left out of the squad for the play-offs which was disappointing as I am an experienced player.“I wasn’t playing much club football at the time so I couldn’t really have an answer to that.“However, I have shown in the past that even when I have been on the bench and called upon I have always done a good job.“I came on and scored in the Euros and played my part in that campaign as well.“Being an experienced player it was disappointing I wasn’t involved.”Following Gwangju’s relegation and change of manager McGinn’s contract was terminated by mutual consent, opening the way to a Pittodrie return where he penned a three-and-a-half year deal in January.It propelled McGinn back into the international reckoning as he was selected for the squad to face South Korea in March but had to pull out through injury.He also missed out on the end-of-season friendlies away to Panama (0-0) and Costa Rica (3-0 loss) with a groin injury that ruled him out of the final games of the domestic season.He sat out the 1-0 win against Celtic at Parkhead.McGinn said: “The lads went into that game knowing if Rangers won at Hibs and we lost, Rangers would finish second – so to achieve what we did was fantastic.“To finish above Rangers was huge considering the financial side of things and the difference in that aspect between the two clubs.“I’m not sure we were recognised as much as we should have been for that.“It was probably our best achievement in the league under Derek McInnes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b1f62abe061e-436x564.jpg ","title":"a bit of hollywood comes to north east","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn iconic

There needs to be some consideration for others as plenty of people go walking with their dogs there.”Quad bikers have been accused of upsetting dog walkers and people visiting the beach and Waters of Philorth Local Nature Reserve.Signs that were put up asking people not to use their vehicles on the beaches have so far been ignored.Mr Buchan said: “This has been a problem for many years.\u0026#8220What I would ask any walkers or joggers or people enjoying the beach is that if they see anyone causing damage on a quad bike, try to grab a picture of it so it can be sent to the police.”Police said people should contact them if they see anything.Fraserburgh Sergeant Martin MacDougall said: “I would ask the public to call Police Scotland on 101 and report any incidents that they become aware of.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cyrenians charity named for providing volunteer friendly opportunities","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen homeless charity has been given an award for providing a positive experience for volunteers.Aberdeen Cyrenians has been reaccredited for the Volunteer Friendly Award, which is given to charities that show “excellence in involving volunteers, lead best practice in volunteering and enables groups to continue to offer positive volunteering opportunities”.Organisations are awarded the accolade on a three-year basis, before it is reassessed.The award was originally created by volunteer support organisation Volunteer Dundee, before being expanded to Aberdeen, where it is delivered by charity sector group ACVO.Sarah Igesund, volunteer co-ordinator at Aberdeen Cyrenians, said: “Volunteers make a huge contribution to the work we do here at Aberdeen Cyrenians and, without their support, many of our services would struggle to run.“It is great that this award acknowledges hard work and dedication to the organisation, while recognising our commitment to positive volunteering experiences.”Mike Melvin, volunteer friendly assessor at ACVO, said: “This is an incredible achievement for Aberdeen Cyrenians.\u0026#8220The award is further testament to the superb services they provide and the contribution volunteers make day in, day out.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"first minister backs call for safeguards to childrens app","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe First Minister has backed a call to increase online safety for children after an Evening Express investigation.Nicola Sturgeon told Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin that internet safety of children should be an “absolute priority” in the wake of a safety issue corrected after our probe.In January, the Evening Express revealed children attending primary schools in the city and Aberdeenshire were unwittingly providing their contact details to strangers on the Snapchat app as their messages were set for public viewing.Ms Martin was horrified and Snap, which makes the app, intervened to make messages posted from primary schools private.She has since called for Snap to offer the same protection to secondary pupils.

Labour and Independent administration pledged to push for the investment in its budget speech in March.This would follow on from the first £250 million city region deal, signed in January 2017 to support the economic growth of the region.The government says it wants to see “clear evidence of positive delivery” before discussing any future arrangements.Ms Laing said: “Aberdeen is currently undergoing the biggest regeneration programme in 40 years.“This massive programme of regeneration has brought economic and social benefits\u0026#8230 and has reaffirmed Aberdeen’s position as Scotland’s northern powerhouse.“It is important that the Scottish Government understands that if the Aberdeen region is to continue to prosper, infrastructure and services need to keep pace with economic growth.”The moves follow the publication of a new report this week, the first stage of a major transport appraisal.The Scottish Transport Guidance (Stag) report aims to give a long-term view of how the city deal could benefit the region’s transport infrastructure.\u0026#8220The report has found that within the region, travel by private car is more popular than all other methods of travel, adding this has “significant impacts on the road network”.The council co-leader added this report has highlighted the need for further investment in transport.Ms Laing said: “We have now received the first Stag report which among other things, highlights high car usage in the Aberdeen region, with the city having a significantly higher car modal share than Edinburgh or Glasgow at 58%, 32% and 36% respectively.“Now is the time for the Scottish Government to work with us and deliver an Aberdeen City Region Deal Two that benefits Aberdeen, Scotland and the United Kingdom economies.”The Scottish Government pledged a further £254m funding package for infrastructure projects on the day the first city region deal was signed.A Scottish Government spokesman said: “We have committed £125m as part of the Aberdeen City Region Deal to develop world-leading expertise, such as the Oil and Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen, plus an additional £254m for key infrastructure projects in the

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000.

We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers.

They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"council perform u turn over","story":"NewsCouncil perform U-turn over car park feesThe astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:41, 13 JUN 2018NewsSouth Beach car park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParking charges WON’T be introduced at two Troon car parks, we can reveal. The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football.

Mhari said: “We had the perfect day with amazing weather and a beautiful sunset.  “All our closest friends and family joined us for a simple but loving ceremony carried out by Peter Clark of the Scottish Humanist Society.” The bride wore a Mori lee dress from Bijoux Bridal, Hamilton. Mhari’s veil held a special sentimental value to it. She said: “The veil is 25 years old which was worn by my aunt on her wedding day.” The groom and best men wore Grey Spirit kilts from Slaters, Ayr. The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother). The newly married Mr and Mrs jetted off for a fortnight in the sun after the big day.  The couple said: “We flew to St Lucia for 2 weeks and stayed at The Royalton. “It was amazing - so relaxed, exactly what we needed after the wedding.” Adore Weddings captured the couple’s big day, with both photography and videography, leaving them with lovely memories to look back on. Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.  Mhari said: “The cake was made by my aunt. “It was baked in Norwich then driven all the way to Scotland and built. “All the flowers are made of icing to match the flowers in my bouquet.” Linzi of Linzi Smith Hair at Distinction styled the hair for the day while Elaine Sawyer of Lookz Mobile Makeup Artist created the makeup looks.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Lowood Bridge closure  SBC release update","story":"GOOD news for motorists - council bosses have confirmed that works to Lowood Bridge are set to be complete in time for Melrose Festival Week.\nThe project is in its final stages and remains on schedule to be completed by Monday, June 18, the day of the Melrosian Rideout.\nSo far, the temporary scaffolding has been removed, which means works on the bridge deck area can start.\nRepairs to the bridge\u0027s stonework are now complete, as well as resurfacing of the Waverley Road/Lowood Road junction.

reinstate a full-time service in the town.\nIn February 2017, the Border  and Peeblesshire News reported that the concession within the Daymart Newsagents on the town\u0026rsquos High Street had closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their stores.\nJust weeks after the announcement, local businessman Andrew Caldwell, of Caldwell\u0026rsquos Ices, came up with a plan to open the service within his store.\nBut a row over the opening hours with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised, further details about the reopening, including information about the range of services that will be on offer to customers, will be released in due course.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on

fascinating medieval history of Stow.\nAlistair Riddell of Stow and Fountainhall Community Council told the Border : \u0026ldquoThe repairs to the graveyard have long been a priority for the local community and it is great to finally get the first grant of money to allow these works to go ahead.\n\"There is a lot of specialist work to be undertaken and the repairs may take several years to complete.\n\"However, once finished the old graveyard will become a real focus for locals and visitors alike.\nStow\u0027s history includes a visit in 1142 by King David I, a visit in 1297 by William Wallace and a visit in 1513 by Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV, prior to the battle of Flodden.\nThe restoration, which is widely supported across the local community, will commence this summer with the repair of an iconic monument, after the required funding was donated by residents of Stow.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Mum and baby left shaken after crossing near miss in

laugh","story":"Perhaps you shouldn’t read this. It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

For services to the Scottish seafood industry.\u0026#8217Mr MacMillan, from Carradale, East Kintyre, has already been invited to the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party on Wednesday July 4.During more than half a century in the industry, Mr MacMillan, 72, has moved from working on a fishing boat, ring netting herring, to fine tuning a computer-controlled smoker to create smoked products for worldwide export.Mr MacMillan, has six employees, one of whom said: \u0026#8216Archie was awarded an MBE for being the best boss.\u0026#8217He took control of the artisan business in 1988 and has incrementally improved it ever since, eventually buying a £60,000 computer controlled smoker which it took him three months to fine tune.Mr MacMillan\u0026#8217s life in the seafood business started at the sharp end. Aged 15,  in 1961 he went to sea in the Amy Harris with an uncle.Mr MacMillan, who eats fish most days, said: \u0026#8216Sometimes in the mid-1960s we were earning between £9 and £11 a week which was a good wage.\u0026#8216It was spring 1962 when we started fishing for scallops and the price of a dozen sold to London was 12/6.\u0026#8217It was a brother of his mother, Mary MacMillan, née Paterson, Archie Paterson, who taught him all he knew, in a decade aboard Harvest Queen.By 1972 some Clyde boats were gearing up for pair trawling, where a net is trawled between two boats.Mr MacMillan, helped with a £12,000 loan from the Highlands and Islands Development Board, bought his own boat, Remembrance, from Finlay Cunningham.For pair trawling Mr MacMillan worked with a partner James Rennie on Monarch and in the 1980s they began exporting scallops to markets, including Belgium, Barcelona and Johannesburg.At the same time as fishing from a boat Mr MacMillan was learning about smoking products.\u0026#8216I used to come to the smokehouse when the weather was too bad to go out on the boat,\u0026#8217 said Mr MacMillan, \u0026#8216That is how I learned to smoke fish \u0026#8211 such as kippers.\u0026#8216It was different days there were not environmental health officers coming chapping at the door,\u0026#8217 added the man who has a prized certificate from SALSA \u0026#8211 Safe and Local Supplier Approval for hot and cold smoking of salmon. Cold smoking of haddock, herring, scallops, mussels and cheese.MacMillan Food\u0026#8217s environmental efforts have also been recognised by the Carbon Trust.That certificate states: \u0026#8216Cutting carbon emissions. Recognising achievements of organisations in tackling climate change.\u0026#8216Given in recognition and appreciation of your organisation\u0026#8217s effort in the field of carbon management, emission reduction and the mitigation of climate change in 2012.\u0026#8217Mr MacMillan added: \u0026#8216Since I bought the smokery from Donnie Gilchrist we have used every inch of ground and moved into two units opposite.\u0026#8217At those two units, Mr MacMillan\u0026#8217s wife Jane has a well equipped kitchen and cold store and creates seafood specialities.The couple like nothing better than driving through the night from Kintyre to attend central belt farmer\u0026#8217s markets.They have a loyal following in Glasgow and Edinburgh and Mr MacMillan says he loves meeting his customers face to face.Locally in Kintyre most of the hotels and guest houses proudly state that they serve Smokehouse products.At the same time his products have gained international recognition.Last month Smokehouse products were chosen for the Eden dinner, at the British embassy in Singapore, during Food and Hotel Asia, the continent\u0026#8217s most comprehensive international food and hospitality event.As news of the MBE award came, Mr MacMillan was also considering a request from a New Zealand firm to stock his products.Mr MacMillan is the first to acknowledge that the firm\u0026#8217s success is a team effort.He said: \u0026#8216It is the same in every business you rely on having great staff or on a fishing boat, a good crew and everything runs smoothly.\u0026#8216One member of staff has just left and we are looking for a trainee to learn all aspects of the business including filleting fish, working the smoking machines and labeling products.\u0026#8216I never thought I would get anything like this.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Musselburgh\u0026rsquos Iceland store is back open after being closed for the refurbishment project.  The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.

Neil Hayes, Iceland\u0026rsquos merchandising and format development director, said: \u0026ldquoRefurbishments on this scale are only possible if we close the stores for a time and I am grateful to all our customers in Musselburgh for their patience. I am sure that they will feel that it has been worth it when they experience the new store."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7885531.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"North Berwick named on list of top 20 most charming towns in Scotland","story":"              NORTH Berwick has been named one of the top 20 charming towns in Scotland.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.  A council spokeswoman confirmed they had and would continue to work closely with police colleagues in \u0026ldquotackling anti-social behaviour in its many forms.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis can involve action being taken against the individuals responsible for the behaviour itself, alongside engagement with parents or s when appropriate.  \u0026ldquoOn the back of operations like the one at Bullet Hill, we also work with colleagues from other council departments to co-ordinate the clean-up of any affected areas so that members of the public can continue to enjoy our open spaces without debris from anti-social behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4089089.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=180\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Residents call for change on recycling boxes","story":"              LOCAL residents have urged\u0026nbspEast Lothian Council to ditch recycling boxes for wheelie bins after the local authority produced a video about the\u0026nbsprecycling process.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.

I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.

A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops. We are grateful for and value all responses, which will be taken into consideration as we look to agree a strategy which meets future needs in and around our communities."},{"url":null,"title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!  John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees.

Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents.

Painted on a 60ft by 40ft wall overlooking the city\u0027s Clutha bar, it features a portrait of Mackintosh looking through a stained-glass window.  The street art was commissioned by Radisson RED and designed and created by Art Pistol Projects and well-known Glasgow street artist Rogue-one as a gift to the city.  As part of the project, Radisson RED has donated \u0026pound1,000 to The Clutha Trust, the charity set up after 10 people died when a police helicopter crashed onto the roof of the pub in November 2013.  Michael Weston, curator at Radisson RED hotel in Glasgow, said: \"After opening our doors in April, we wanted to give something that showed our commitment to the local art scene as well as the city of Glasgow itself.  \"It was important to us that the mural represented a key piece of Glasgow\u0027s history, so commissioning a mural of one of the city\u0027s most iconic artists, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was perfect.  \"It is a fitting tribute to one of Glasgow\u0027s greatest talents in his 150th anniversary year - and I\u0027d encourage everyone to come see it.\"  Born on June 7 1868, Mackintosh trained as an architect and went on to create much-admired buildings including the Glasgow School of Art and Scotland Street School in Glasgow.  The mural was given the go-ahead following a planning row after an objection from a neighbouring business.  Alan Crossan, owner of the Clutha bar, said: \"This mural is a fantastic piece of artwork and a fantastic donation to the Clutha Trust.\"  Bobby McNamara, known as Rogue-one, is renowned for his photo-realistic style and is behind a number of artworks in Glasgow, including Mitchell Street\u0027s floating taxi.  Mr McNamara said: \"From the original design sketch to the completion of the mural, it\u0027s been hard work but of course great fun.  \"Using scaffolding to access the wall was awkward at times as it\u0027s hard to see what you\u0027re doing, but I pushed on utilising my skills and experience.

One teacher in Edinburgh said they had spent around 70 hours administering the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos standardised tests on their school\u0026rsquos 54 primary one pupils.  It comes as ministers came under increasing pressure to scrap the assessments amid claims some children have been reduced to tears.  In an email sent to Scottish Labour MSP Iain Gray, the Edinburgh primary teacher said they had overseen 30 hours of testing for numeracy and 40 for literacy.  They added: \u0026ldquoThe amount of progress that could have been delivered if those hours were used for effective teaching is significant and instead we were required to use that time to run testing which\u0026hellipis problematic in almost every regard.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the new tests last year as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  But critics insist testing pupils in the first year of primary \u0026ndash as well as in P4, P7 and S3 \u0026ndash piles too much pressure on children and teachers.  Raising the issue at First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers had told him that young, confident children had been \u0026ldquocrushed by the assessments.  Calling for them to be scrapped, he said: \u0026ldquoAt SNP conference John Swinney claimed that we are seeing the start of a renaissance in Scottish education. This \u0026lsquorenaissance\u0026rsquo is driving primary school children to tears.  \u0026ldquoThese tests have been flawed from the very start. Delivered late, \u0026pound2 million over budget and have led to weeks of valuable teaching time lost.  In their email, the Edinburgh teacher \u0026ndash whose identity has been kept anonymous to protect their job \u0026ndash also raised a number of issues with the design and wording of the tests.  They wrote: \u0026ldquoMany of the questions in the tests are very poorly phrased \u0026ndash often at best they are ambiguous and at worst they are so badly written that they are actually misleading.  In one example, children were presented with the problem: \u0026ldquoJane had six grapes on her plate, she ate three of them, choose Jane\u0026rsquos plate.  The teacher said the phrasing of the question made it unclear whether pupils should choose the half-eaten plate, or the original.  They also noted that out of the 54 pupils tested, \u0026ldquonot one child came out as low on the numeracy test, even though some of them only gave a handful of correct answers.  They added: \u0026ldquoThe only conclusion I can reach having watched this process from beginning to end is that these tests have been set up to give a deliberately vague picture which broadly supports the idea that the attainment gap is closing.  \u0026ldquoI cannot use the data from these tests to support my teaching in any way. It does not provide reliable information on any aspect of my children\u0026rsquos learning or development.  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, said many of the concerns raised by the teacher had also been brought up by other members.  He said primary teachers faced a logistical challenge as they administered the tests, which require pupils to have access to computers.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe had people at the [latest] conference talking about children being distressed.  Responding to Mr Leonard at FMQs, Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoWe are determined, as I have said on so many occasions, to continue to raise standards in our schools, and to close the attainment gap.  \u0026ldquoAnd being able to assess, in an age-appropriate way, how our young people are doing in school is an important part of that. We will continue to work hard to make sure we do that."},{"url":null,"title":"Obstructionist tactics of Parnell  39 s Irish Nationalists should be SNP   39 template   39  say party insiders","story":"              THE obstructionist tactics of the Irish Nationalists under Charles Stewart Parnell in the 19th century should become the \u0026ldquotemplate for the SNP at Westminster in its threat to frustrate UK Government business, party insiders have suggested.  Taking a leaf out of the Irish Parliamentary Party\u0026rsquos book could mean Scottish Nationalist MPs making lengthy speeches, creating innumerable amendments to bills and calling for unnecessary votes tactics designed to \u0026ldquogum up the Westminster system.  In Commons exchanges, SNP MP Stewart McDonald invoked the spirit of Mr Parnell, who led the campaign for Irish Home Rule in the 1880s his bronze bust sits outside party leader Ian Blackford\u0026rsquos Commons office.  Mr McDonald told MPs: \u0026ldquoParnell, of course, along with his colleagues at the time, successfully used the standing orders of the House to frustrate Government business - which is an entirely legitimate tactic - to force them to take Irish issues seriously, including in a 45-hour sitting on the 1877 South Africa Bill.  \u0026ldquoGiven the way that Ireland has this Government over a barrel at the minute, it might just be that those tactics are of interest to honourable members at the present time, said the Glasgow South MP.  In his Herald column today, Kenny Macaskill, the former Scottish Government Justice Secretary, says that Parnell\u0026rsquos Irish Parliamentary Party should now be the \u0026ldquomodel for the SNP at Westminster.  \u0026ldquoUnder the great Charles Stewart Parnell they flourished in the chamber when it suited them but never forgot that their purpose was to leave it, he explains, adding: \u0026ldquoHopefully, that will now be the template for the modern SNP\u0026hellip  Asked about the Nationalist leadership\u0026rsquos threat to frustrate Government business in the Commons, Theresa May\u0026rsquos spokesman stressed how UK ministers had sought to \u0026ldquowork constructively with the Scottish Government and the SNP leadership throughout the Brexit process and would continue to do so.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a matter for the SNP what they choose to do in Parliament.  As reported by The Herald yesterday, the constitutional row over the EU Withdrawal Bill and Holyrood withholding consent looks set to be repeated this autumn over the Government\u0026rsquos Trade Bill as Edinburgh has similar \u0026ldquopower-grab concerns about it.  This means when Whitehall seeks the consent of MSPs on the important legislation, they will almost certainly refuse to give it.  Back in the Commons after his eviction from Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, Mr Blackford claimed the Tory Government had \"totally shafted\" the people of Scotland over Brexit and repeated his call for David Mundell to resign.  The party leader accused the Scottish Secretary of having \"downgraded devolution\" and urged him to apologise for ignoring Holyrood by supporting the Withdrawal Bill.  But Mr Mundell countered by insisting the so-called Sewel Convention was not absolute, explaining how the UK Government would seek consent from Holyrood unless there were \"not normal circumstances applying\". Leaving the EU, he contended, was \u0026ldquonot normal circumstances\".  The Secretary of State claimed the SNP Government had adopted an \u0026ldquounreasonable position from the outset ie \u0026ldquoit would be content with nothing less than a veto on UK matters. This, he said, was unacceptable as it would undermine the integrity of the country\u0027s internal market.  \u0026ldquoWe reached out to Michael Russell to see whether he was willing to engage with that process, explained the Scottish Secretary. \u0026ldquoBut I am afraid the clear message was that the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos position is as it was\u0026hellipand that there is no scope for compromise.  Mr Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Brexit Minister, was in Dublin on Thursday, where he insisted the devolved administrations \u0026ldquomust be involved in any future trade negotiations post Brexit something the PM has hitherto set her face against.  *Meanwhile, it has emerged the Commons Speaker has granted a debate on Scotland and Brexit for Monday it is due to coincide with England\u0026rsquos opening World Cup match against Tunisia."},{"url":null,"title":"Auditors slam Government  39 s flagship benefit Universal Credit","story":"              THE Government\u0027s flagship Universal Credit benefit could end up costing more than the benefits system it is replacing, according to a damning report from the National Audit Office (NAO).  The benefit for job-seekers, which incorporates housing costs and five other benefits into one payment, is also taking far longer to roll out than intended.  \"Universal Credit (UC) has not delivered value for money and it is uncertain that it ever will\", the public spending watchdog said.  The Department for Work and Pensions has admitted itself that it cannot measure whether managing the programme but has itself admitted that it cannot measure whether UC is achieving its policy goal of getting an additional 200,000 people into work.  The roll-out was initially intended to be complete by October 2017, but at present only around one in ten of those eventually expected to be on UC are claiming it.  The NAO also queried claims by the department that people were not suffering difficulties and hardship and satisfaction rates among claimants are high.  It said the DWP had not shown sufficient sensitivity towards some claimants and that it does not know how many claimants are having problems with the programme.  Its report concludes that there is no practical alternative to continuing with rollout of UC but said ministers should make sure the programme does not expand before it has learned from insights it has gained from the roll-out so far.  Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said \u0026ldquoThe Department has kept pushing the Universal Credit rollout forward through a series of problems. We recognise both its determination and commitment, and that there is really no practical choice but to keep on keeping on with the rollout.  \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot think DWP has shown the same commitment to listening and responding to the hardship faced by claimants.  \"We think the larger claims for Universal Credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future. Nor for that matter will value for money.  Critics of the Government\u0027s Universal Credit have seized the report to call for changes to the flagship benefit.  Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"While Universal Credit is working well for some, more than a quarter of a million people are expected to wait longer than five weeks for their first full payment. This puts them at risk of falling behind on bills and getting into debt - a heavy price to pay for a system that isn\u0027t working properly.\"  Alison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: \"The picture the NAO presents is justifiably bleak.  \"On the ground, new claimants can\u0027t even be sure they will be paid in full and on time, and how many people will be helped into work by the benefit is far from clear.\"  Margaret Greenwood, shadow DWP secretary, said: \"The Government has shamelessly ignored warning after warning about the devastating impact their flagship welfare reform has had on people\u0027s lives.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Ian McConnell  Britain seems like such a funny little country when the Brexiters bluster","story":"              BRITAIN sometimes seems like a funny little country these days.

And the UK\u0026rsquos own woeful performance and policy errors, and the rise of other countries, such as India, look set to ensure the drift down the rankings continues.  It is important to recognise that a country\u0026rsquos standing on the international stage is about much more than just size. It is also about influence, and attitude, and behaviour. Unfortunately for the UK, there is surely no arguing with the assertion that, in the strange days since the Brexit vote, the description of \u0026ldquofunny little could be applied to the mindset of so many Brexiters when it comes to the wider world.  It has been another most curious, though unfortunately no less lamentable, week on the Brexit front.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Taiwan strives for regional cooperation as UK turns back on partners with Brexit  We have had blustering Tory Brexiters in the House of Commons declaim (to summarise) that the people voted for Brexit and they must not be denied it.  In the same week, we have had a further raft of dismal economic figures which show the UK, weighed down by Brexit uncertainty, is in grim shape even before we get to the horrors of the actual breakaway from the huge free-trade bloc.  Yet, we are told, the Brexiters will jolly well have what they voted for. They will not be swayed by the realities of the situation, which they seem to regard as propaganda by people they oh-so-tiresomely refer to as \u0026ldquoRemoaners. Albeit the schoolboyish \u0026ldquoRemoaner jibe is certainly preferable to the \u0026ldquotraitor comments you sometimes hear bandied around when it comes to Brexit. \u0026ldquoTraitor is an extreme word, and its use by some Leave voters underlines the divisive and intolerant nature of Brexit.  Fears over the state of the UK economy intensified this week when official data revealed the sharpest monthly drop in manufacturing output since October 2012. The 1.4 per cent month-on-month plunge will surely be a disappointment to some in the Brexit camp (even if they will not admit it). It highlights not only the domestic economic malaise but also the fact that sterling weakness arising from the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit vote does not appear to have been the catalyst for a lasting export boom.  Read More: Fears over UK economy intensify as manufacturing output plunges  Not than anyone should have expected it to be such a catalyst. After all, you would imagine all the uncertainty around trade arrangements after Blighty quits the European Union would not be trumped by a pricing advantage for UK exporters arising from sterling weakness. Especially given the pound\u0026rsquos troubles have sent UK companies\u0026rsquo import costs rocketing.  Also this week, we have had figures from the Office for National Statistics signalling underlying weakness in the UK construction sector. The data showed construction output rose by just 0.5% in April, having tumbled by 2.3% in March as freezing weather disrupted activity. Economists had forecast construction output would have bounced back by 2% in April.  Meanwhile, trade figures this week from the ONS were dire.  The UK\u0026rsquos global goods trade deficit widened from \u0026pound12 billion in March to \u0026pound14.04bn in April, much worse than the \u0026pound11.35bn forecast by economists, as exports fell sharply and imports rose. The deterioration was driven by a widening of the UK\u0026rsquos deficit on trade in goods with countries outwith the EU, from \u0026pound3.79bn to \u0026pound5.37bn.

The Brexiters\u0026rsquo head-in-the-British-sand attitude has meant the absence of any catalyst for their imagined boom in UK trade with countries outside the EU has not dampened their bizarre enthusiasm.  At the end of the day, Brexit is a fool\u0026rsquos errand driven by ideology and not by considerations of people\u0026rsquos standards of living, which are dictated in large part by economic success or otherwise. Xenophobia and opposition to immigration look to have been key factors in the Brexit vote.  You still hear the Brexiters bang on about the benefits of leaving the EU. These remain entirely elusive but that, it seems, does not matter one whit to the Brexiters. All the while, some of them harp on about the fabulous bounties which Blighty is going to reap from a raft of new free-trade deals.

One of those countries at the forefront of this is the US, which some in the UK Government seem to believe is going to be falling over itself to do one of the fastest-arranged trade deals of modern times with Britain, even though nothing of substance has happened on this front in the two years since the Brexit vote.  Meanwhile, there is no sign that the other countries which the UK Government has had its sights on, in its desperate lobbying mission to try to make Brexit look like a good idea, will be putting Britain ahead of the massive and powerful EU bloc in the queue for trade deals. Why would these countries prioritise foolishly by putting an isolated UK ahead of the huge EU bloc?  And this brings us back to the essence of the problem.  The UK is a sizeable economy. However, its influence is dwindling as other countries rise. Faced with such challenges, being part of a powerful bloc such as the EU has been hugely important.  Many in the Brexit camp seem to believe the UK is the most important country in the world. They need to wake up to the fact the UK Government\u0026rsquos ridiculously over-elevated sense of the country\u0026rsquos importance does not chime at all with the reality of today\u0026rsquos world.  Chance would be a fine thing though. Instead, the Brexiters and their Government at Westminster seem hell-bent on pursuing a dream of making the UK an economic backwater, with a funny little mindset when it comes to the big world out there."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7928927.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Meet schoolgirl  12  taking powerboat world by storm","story":"              MOST 12-year-olds spend their free time at the cinema or chatting with friends on social media.

Oban said: \u0026ldquoI can\u0026rsquot wait.

She said her interest was sparked when she was eight years old and joined her family for a day out on a rigid-hulled inflatable boat.      And, when it comes to action and adventure, Oban is clearly a chip off the old block.  Her father, Ewen, 46, is an industrial firefighter while her mother, Karen, 49, who used to be in the Army, now works in security.  \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoMy husband\u0026rsquos an industrial firefighter.

Having become an international sports ambassador, Oban is actively involved in teaching other young people about powerboat racing and water safety.  She secured the role after being invited to a global gathering in Sri Lanka in 2016 where she spoke about her experiences before hundreds of delegates from over 50 countries.  The youngster\u0026rsquos next challenge will involve taking out a single-seater measuring 3.1 metres in length, with up to 10 other boats from around the UK competing in each race.

New figures show 474 of Scotland\u0026rsquos 2,514 primaries, secondaries and special schools have not been inspected since 2008.  Three were identified as not having been inspected since 2002 - Canna Primary in the Highlands, Sandwick Junior High in Shetland and Back School in the Western Isles.  A decline in the number of inspections over the past few years has already sparked concerns.  Education Scotland, which incorporates the inspectorate, said the drop was partly down to a deliberate move to reduce the burden on schools and target those that need help the most.  Inspectors have also been used in recent years to help schools implement the Curriculum for Excellence with the number of inspections now increasing to 250 a year.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for Scottish Labour, attacked the decline, revealed in a freedom of information request by the Times Educational Supplement Scotland.  He also attacked the decision to merge the former inspectorate with a separate curriculum body to establish Education Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThis government is perfectly prepared to subject five-year-olds to high stakes tests in the name of standards, while letting the established inspection regime wither, he said.  Liz Smith, education spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservative Party, said inspections were \u0026ldquovital.  \u0026ldquoIt cannot be right that pupils can go through all the years of primary or all the years of secondary without their school being inspected, she said.  A spokesman for Education Scotland said inspections were only one aspect of its scrutiny work.  He said: \"Schools are inspected on a proportionate basis, using a sampling approach rather than a cyclical model.  \"When selecting schools for inspection we consider\u0026nbspa range of factors including local circumstances and the length of time since the last inspection.

President Vladimir Putin certainly thinks so. In his opening speech at the unveiling of the 21st World Cup finals on Thursday he said: \u0026ldquoFootball brings us together in one single team and we are united by our affection \u0026hellip by different language, ideology or faith. All that missing was an exhortation for us all to join hands together in a rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.  The Greatest Show on Earth isn\u0026rsquot a carnival of peace and goodwill it\u0026rsquos predatory and materialistic and a quadrennial celebration of the credo that might is right and greed is good. Nor can football fanatics like me who fancy ourselves to be all liberal and enlightened claim it has only lately come to be this way and that it has fallen victim to corporate and financial muscle: it\u0026rsquos always been like this. You can add other stuff to the brimstone and treacle like xenophobia, national paranoia, revenge and the mentality of the mob.  The second World Cup held in Italy in 1934 and won by the host nation did not feature Uruguay, the tournament\u0026rsquos first winners and hosts in 1930. Even after four years the South Americans were still nursing a grievance that Italy and several other European nations had refused the invitation to compete in Uruguay. There were loftier reasons the Uruguayans could have cited for their absence, none more so than Benito Mussolini using the tournament as a showcase for his fascist dictatorship and the lingering suspicion that he had personally hand-picked the referees for games involving Italy.  Argentina\u0026rsquos military junta copied Mussolini\u0026rsquos opportunism when they hosted the World Cup in 1978. It was well-known that thousands of Argentinians were \u0026lsquodisappeared\u0026rsquo by the regime on suspicion of disloyalty but FIFA, football\u0026rsquos governing body, obviously felt this was a trifling matter and one that had nothing to do with football. The rest of us too shut our eyes and passed by meekly on the other side of the road. We do this every time the World Cup comes about and we do it when it comes to the Champions League and to our own domestic competitions. Where football is concerned we become amoral automatons, happy to overlook petty corruption, profiteering and the sort of attitudes towards fairness and equality that make Jacob Rees-Mogg look like the president of Unicef.  In our real lives we might march against poverty and rail against low wages and unemployment. We seek fair distribution of wealth and an end to the huge gaps in health and education that exist in our society caused by social inequality. When it comes to football, though, we leave all of these ethics at the turnstile. You could fit the wage bill of the entire Scottish Premier Division inside the payroll of my team, Celtic, and there would still be some change. Yet, not a jot do I care.  I celebrated a second successive treble in the same manner as I would have done if we had defeated Real Madrid and Bayern Munich on the way. I am impervious to the privations of other clubs. Celtic were forced kicking and screaming into paying the Living Wage for its lowest-paid employees and then only after withdrawing the bonus scheme these people had previously relied upon. This didn\u0026rsquot stop me renewing my \u0026pound627 season ticket. Do I want my club to share some of its riches with the honest and deserving poor amongst its fellow clubs? I most certainly do not. In life I am a socialist but football has made me a capitalist and an implacable one at that.  Football really does think it\u0026rsquos a force for world peace and reconciliation. In reality, though, its mere presence endorses and exonerates regimes involved in crimes against humanity. And it anaesthetises the rest of us into a sort of moral stupor where we suspend any notions we might previously have had about constitutes right and wrong. We even find ourselves exhibiting some of the most wretched tendencies harboured by the World Cup. I was desperate for Egypt to beat Uruguay yesterday afternoon and not because of the pyramids and Mo Salah. Rather, I still haven\u0026rsquot forgiven Uruguay for kicking Scotland off the park at Mexico 32 years ago. Reconciliation: aye right.  When FIFA\u0026rsquos World Cup comes to town the host nation is expected to pay tribute by suspending its normal customs and conventions. The first to go are usually those built around decency, honesty and compassion. Thus in Brazil in 2014, in cities with some of the most appalling rates of poverty and multi-deprivation, vital infrastructure projects were suspended to help pay for the swanky new stadiums. Contracts were carved up by government-favoured companies with links to organised crime.  FIFA, you see, operates as a mendicant global superstate unhindered by the conventions of the EU, the UN or NATO. It does as it pleases and the corruption that riddled it went unchecked for decades simply because national governments feared the popular consequences of sanctions being applied to its football teams. No wonder Vladimir Putin was beaming from the best seat in the house at Moscow\u0026rsquos Luzhniki Stadium on Thursday. He knows that for a few weeks the world will conveniently choose to forget his crackdown on the LGBTI community as the Russian police are tasked with seeking out any displays of physical affection by gay people.  Yet I have dutifully set my television to record every game of this World Cup and have already spent a right few quid trying to fill my Panini World Cup sticker album. Football, for all the shallow caprices at its core, retains those values that first attracted us to it in the purity and innocence of childhood: the feeling of belonging to something important of finding a common interest that overcomes feelings of inadequacy. In my own west of Scotland it still provides the language by which some parents rendered sullen by an aggregation of social defeats can communicate and reach out emotionally to their children. It provides moments that come to form part of our families\u0026rsquo shared memories. It permits children whom the elite have judged and found wanting to dream of glory and a lifestyle beyond their expectations. And it lets the rest of us simply derive pleasure from seeing some of them do so."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/5402237.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Remembered  at last  the hungry people who made Glasgow","story":"              Switching between English and Gaeilge, an Irish minister of state on Friday told of the hunger that drove thousands from his island to Glasgow. \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot always easy, Joe McHugh said, for Ireland\u0026rsquos famine refugees \u0026ldquoThey felt marginalised. Some faced discrimination and exclusion.  Then the Fine Gael politician said something that suggested a new mood about an event that changed Scotland as well as his own country. The potato blight of the 1840s, he declared, hit \u0026ldquoall traditions and all four provinces.  As Mr McHugh spoke, Edward Hyde let out a grunt of approval. His head was lowered as if in prayer, his chin pointed at his Orange Lodge tie and red poppy lapel badge.  This was the dedication of Glasgow\u0026rsquos first monument to those who those who fled the potato famine, 17 decades after they arrived in a depression- and disease-hit city.  And, unlike any of hundreds of other such memorials, this one remembers both Irish and Scot, both Catholic and Protestant.  And so Mr McHugh, and Mr Hyde found some reconciliation, as well as remembrance, in a little garden by the People\u0026rsquos Palace in Glasgow Green.  Mr Hyde, grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, served on the steering group that took six - sometimes difficult years - trying to find a way to mark the great hunger, the Gorta M\u0026oacuter.  He said: \u0026ldquoMy grandfather - like Mr McHugh - was from Donegal. The blight didn\u0026rsquot choose who to affect, it affected all communities. People think it was only Catholics who suffered.  It was Mr Hyde, he said, who came up with a living memorial, inspired by an abandoned village in Cork turned in to a place to remember the famine\u0026rsquos victims, the million dead, the two million forced to flee to the New World or the old.  The Irish and Highland Famine Memorial Garden is designed to die in winter and grow back in the summer. At its centre is an upturned boat with a simple message on its hull: \u0026ldquoEven the birds were silent in grief. As officials explained its symbolism, grasses and wildflowers swayed in a chilly June breeze that carried a thick scent from a brewery upwind.  Glasgow City Council\u0026rsquos deputy leader, David McDonald, referred to the path those visiting can take through the garden. There had been \u0026ldquobollards and blockages along the way, he admitted. The project had been condemned, initially, as \u0026ldquoamateur and historically inaccurate by the Professor Sir Tom Devine. On Friday the pre-eminent historian of the period followed Mr McDonald and Mr McHugh to dedicate the garden.  Later he said: \u0026ldquoThis is an inclusive memorial to protestant Irish, catholic Irish and the Gaels, most of whom were of the Presbyterian persuasion.  \u0026ldquoThat is a potent reminder for today of how immigration, even of the displaced and distressed, can ultimately have a positive impact on the host society.  Nobody was pretending that Glasgow opened its arms to the Irish - or the Scottish Gaels whose famine, though far less deadly than Ireland\u0026rsquos, also drove them to the Clyde.  But the message, from Ireland and Scotland, on Friday was that refugees and migrants ultimately benefit host nations and cities. The Scottish Refugee Council was one of the partners behind the memorial.  Baillie Norman MacLeod - of mixed Scots Gaelic and Irish stock - explained. \u0026ldquoWe cannot say the welcome was as it should have been, he said before remembering Highland and Irish migrants were followed by Italians, Jews, Lithuanians and Pakistanis and whole new generation of new Scots from the EU. \u0026ldquoThis is what has made Glasgow what we are: a proudly multi-ethnic city.  The garden is overlooked by the Doulton Fountain, a ceramic monument to Victoria, the \u0026ldquofamine queen and her empire. The monarch, in fact, personally sympathised with the starving Irish. Her government did not.  What did Mr McHugh think of Victoria? The minister smiled and talked of today\u0027s Queen visiting Dublin. \u0026ldquoAll that is part of reconciliation, he said \u0026ldquoWe are moving into a new space to try understand our past, warts and all, and respect where we are now.  \u0026ldquoWhen we look at global mass movement today because of conflict and hunger, we should try to learn from our experiences.  The making of a monument  FIVE years ago Sir Tom Devine was not impressed. A proposed monument to the Irish famine, he said, was \"founded on comforting myth and unproven beliefs\".  Glasgow council - some 17 decades after the hunger of 1847 - had effectively just patted itself on the back with a motion to erect a monument to its own generosity.  The city agreed to a memorial to the great hunger but wanted to \"recognise the efforts made by Glaswegians at the time to provide relief and sanctuary to those affected\".    Professor Sir Tom Devine  It took Sir Tom, the country\u0027s pre-eminent historian, to insist Scotland instead acknowledged uncomfortable truth. Yes, perhaps 100,000 Irish found shelter in Glasgow, but half were sent home. And their arrival, the professor said, marked a watershed in anti-Irish, anti-Catholic bigotry.  Glasgow listened to Sir Tom. Its memorial garden reflects the unfiltered stories of Irish - protestant and Catholic - and Highlanders who came to Glasgow to escape hunger. An exhibition also explains the context of that cold welcome. Glasgow in the late 1940s was in enduring a depression. There was typhus then cholera. \"The burial rate quadrupled,\" the historian explained. Among those moaning of an Irish \"visitation\" was the Roman Catholic bishop, John Murdoch, who was watching his own priests die.  \"As far as I am aware they went through at least eight iterations,\" Sir Tom said of the history boards that form an essential part of the garden. \"They now bear no relationship to the inaccuracies of that first narrative.  \"I said before that the beast of sectarianism was not quiet dead but it is no longer red in tooth and claw.  \"For that I was condemned by some for being too optimistic. But the fact is that the council has made a public demonstration that we must now regard the people of Glasgow \u0026ndash whatever their religious traditions - as part of the same family. Glasgow has delivered.\""},{"url":null,"title":"SNP leadership plans its   39 frustration strategy  39  to disrupt Government business at Westminster","story":"              SNP chiefs are this weekend expected to map out their \u0026ldquofrustration strategy aimed at disrupting UK Government business at Westminster in the wake of Theresa May\u0026rsquos decision to plough ahead with the Brexit Bill in the face of Holyrood\u0026rsquos opposition.  Nicola Sturgeon, Ian Blackford and other senior figures will discuss how the party can best highlight its grievance with the UK Government\u0026rsquos action, branded by the SNP leadership as a \u0026ldquodemocratic outrage.  After the Westminster party leader was ordered from the House of Commons by the Speaker, John Bercow on Wednesday, which led to a mass walk-out by Nationalist MPs, |Mr Blackford made clear that the country was now in a constitutional crisis and that a new era had emerged in which the Scottish Nationalists would seek to \u0026ldquofrustrate the day-to-day business of the Prime Minister and her colleagues.  The Highland MP stressed how his party would robustly use parliamentary procedures to make their displeasure known, although precise details of future action were not given.  When it was suggested yesterday that the SNP might seek to frustrate the UK Government\u0026rsquos aim of creating a third runway at Heathrow \u0026ndash Nationalist votes in the Commons could be key to realising the Conservative plan \u0026ndash the party leader gave a non-committal response.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not prepared to get into what we\u0026rsquore going to do over the next few weeks. We will be taking it one step at a time.  Some of Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos colleagues have suggested that the \u0026ldquotemplate for the SNP\u0026rsquos frustration strategy should be the obstructionist actions of Charles Stewart Parnell and the Irish Nationalists of the 19th century, who used a number of parliamentary devices to \u0026ldquogum up Westminster\u0026rsquos business. These included making overly lengthy speeches, tabling numerous amendments and calling continual votes.  On Wednesday, the SNP leader deployed the unusual parliamentary technique of calling on the Speaker to allow a vote to enable the Commons to sit in private session. This would have meant, if passed, the public would have been ejected as well as journalists, so that the proceedings would not have been recorded.  On Monday, MPs will take part in a so-called SO24 debate on the issue of Brexit and devolution, the subject of which caused so much controversy earlier this week when Commons exchanges on the subject took up just 15 minutes with another four devoted to the issue of the Northern Irish border.  Elsewhere, Mr Blackford has written to Mrs May to complain about the actions of Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, who he said had shouted \"suicide\" at the Nationalist benches when the party asked the Speaker what options were available to them concerning the lack of debate on devolution and their claim of a Whitehall power-grab.  \u0026ldquoTo shout \u0027suicide\u0027 across the chamber is not fitting of a Member of Parliament and it should not be tolerated, declared the SNP leader.  \u0026ldquoA few months ago, I met with the Prime Minister and other party leaders to discuss how we can combat bullying behaviour in the House of Commons. It was agreed that we should find a solution.  \u0026ldquoThis is not the first time our MPs have suffered abuse in the chamber. Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames was forced to apologise to Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh during a statement by the Foreign Secretary, for making \u0026lsquowoofing\u0026rsquo noises at her.  \"This sort of behaviour is unacceptable MPs must lead by example. I have suggested to the Prime Minister that she raises this issue with the House next week,\" added the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber.  But Mr Liddell-Grainger has hit back, insisting he referred to \u0026ldquopolitical suicide and as a former soldier was well aware of mental health issues.  He claimed his remark had been blown out of proportion and criticised the SNP for raising the issue after he had left the chamber, an action he branded \u0026ldquopathetic and cowardly.  The Tory backbencher added: \"As a Scot I am not prepared to take lessons from a bunch of people who have not only ruined their country but who can\u0026rsquot be bothered to listen properly to what people say. They can take their objections and stuff them.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Unspun  the political diary","story":"              THERE was limitless cynicism around the SNP walk-out at PMQs.

It will make for a busy summer in Waverley Gate. Especially as the body has, as well as its normal functions, a review of its funding system to carry out, and, as the new chairman Robert Wilson has now said, a review of its entire form, function and structure. So there\u0027s a lot of work to do.  And it seems inevitable that at least some changes will be made, either in structure or in personnel.  Why inevitable? Because if Creative Scotland has one primary task it is to decide who, in the wide and eclectic world of Scotland\u0027s culture, gets funding and why. And also, who doesn\u0027t, and why not. And to do so clearly and with some understandable rationale.  However, in the last round of Regular Funding, its decision makers managed to create confusion where they should have been clarity, bewilderment where there could have been comprehension, and, once again, alienated artists and companies who, after all, should be the object of their key relationships. That the Regular Funding debacle - if that is not too strong a term, which it may not be - happened after a relatively generous Budget settlement from the Government, rather than savage cuts, adds to the appearance of a wholly avoidable mess. It looks dysfunctional.  I was told last week not to expect fast or dramatic changes at the top of Creative Scotland.

The unusual weather conditions have meant there\u0026rsquos an unexpected glut of Scottish strawberries, said to be larger, sweeter and juicier than normal.  It\u0026rsquos led to a boost for shoppers, who are snapping up cut-price punnets of high quality fruit as supermarkets battle to clear the backlog and avoid stocks going to waste.  The Scottish strawberry season has been thrown into confusion by the cold snap at the start of the year which caused some varieties of berries to take longer to reach maturity.  Then, the recent hot conditions have sped up the ripening process for other varieties of strawberries \u0026ndash creating larger and juicier fruit much earlier in the season.  The unusual climate conditions have now sparked predictions of a bumper strawberry season.  However, the downside is that tonnes of Scottish berries which would normally ripen at different times, are hitting the market together - and clashing with the English strawberry season which is already underway.  The extra stock has caused supermarket prices to crash, meaning shoppers are picking up giant-sized punnets containing extra-large strawberries for a fraction of their normal cost.  In a bid to help suppliers tackle a massive surplus of stock, cut-price supermarket Aldi has now has stepped in to snap up more than 80 tonnes of Scottish strawberries.  The chain, which has started selling kilo-gram size \u0026lsquosuper-punnets\u0026rsquo at its Scottish stores, says the move is also intended to prevent fruit going to waste.  Julie Ashfield, managing director of Buying at Aldi UK, said: \u0026ldquoThe recent warm weather has led to our growers needing to harvest a vast amount of their crop much later than usual. We always try to find ways to support them in times like this, while at the same time reducing unnecessary food waste.  \u0026ldquoScottish strawberries are also typically brighter in colour and tastier compared with imported varieties, meaning our customers can enjoy more of the fruit at the best time of the year.  The supermarket, which earlier this month struck a deal to buy 700,000 potatoes from a UK supplier faced with a bumper crop, is selling its larger strawberry punnets at \u0026pound2.95 per kg in a bid to move stock as fast as possible.  Despite the over-supply, farmers are to receive the same rate per kilogram of fruit from Aldi as normal.  David Stephen of Barra Berries, Oldmeldrum near Inverurie, said any major over-supply of fruit is normally curtailed because of the controlled conditions in which berries are grown.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos not usually a huge over-supply because fruit is grown in tunnels which means that to a large extent its protected from the elements.  \u0026ldquoHowever, there\u0026rsquos always a slight problem if the English and Scottish crops pick up at the exact same time.  Predictions of a bumper harvest have added to farmers\u0026rsquo concerns over attracting adequate numbers of workers to pick the crops.  Some farmers are said to be paying for flights for teams of fruit-pickers from Bulgaria in a desperate move to avoid losing their crops.  Some have blamed the impact of Brexit, which they say has left workers from Bulgaria and Poland reluctant to travel to the UK to work.  There have also been claims that \u0026lsquogangmasters\u0026rsquo have been operating around some farms, intent on luring fruit-pickers to rival fields.  Production of strawberries and raspberries in Scotland has nearly doubled over the past decade, mostly driven by strawberry sales.  Thanks to polytunnels and new varieties of strawberries which have been developed to give improved flavour, appearance, longevity, yield and shelf life, fruit farmers are able to stretch what used to be a brief berry season, to last from May - and sometimes earlier - through to October. They now produce around 25,000 tonnes of strawberries each year.  Geoff Bruce, of Bruce Farms in Meigle, Perthshire, which supplies soft fruit for Scotty Brand, said the season has already produced impressive yields of particularly succulent and sweet strawberries.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos down to the weather, but to be honest we\u0026rsquore so busy I can hardly remember what the weather was like yesterday, never mind a few weeks ago.  \u0026ldquoThere are always good bits and less good bits in every season. It\u0026rsquos a long season and we have to just hope it continues like this.  The Scottish soft fruit industry, mostly based in Tayside and Fife, is worth \u0026pound100m a year."},{"url":null,"title":"Tom Gordon  Tory Brexit insults are helping the SNP s case on devolution","story":"              THE noisy walk-out staged by SNP MPs in the Commons on Wednesday marked the start of a new obstructionist phase for the party, we\u0026rsquore told.  Filibusters and obscure parliamentary devices to disrupt Westminster business and delay Brexit legislation are afoot.  The cosy days are over, and the Nats are about to cut up rough.  Well, possibly. You can be sure Speaker Bercow is already swotting up on possible \u0026ldquoguerilla tactics, and what he can do about them.  The walk-out succeeded in drawing attention to the \u0026lsquopower grab\u0026rsquo in the EU Withdrawal Bill and the pathetic 19 minutes of pseudo-debate given over to its devolved aspects the previous day.  But the law of diminishing returns risks any obstructionist looking juvenile and tiresome after a while. Voters also tend to prefer hard-working MPs over jesters.  To me, the walk-out also marked the start of the 2021 Holyrood election campaign, and the launch of the SNP\u0026rsquos theme, one that Brexit has given real traction: \u0026lsquoDevolution is dead, long live independence\u0026rsquo.  Right now, that might sound a bit fanciful. Devolution is plainly not dead, even if it\u0026rsquos been in better health. But there are almost three years to the election, and I suspect the SNP will be using them all to bang home that it\u0026rsquos on its last legs.  As the party found in 2014, the Union is a tough target. It has 300 years of history behind it. It is self-evidently durable. Many voters are vehemently attached to it.  But devolution is a softer affair. People are glad its here, sure enough, but are they brimming with passion about it? Are campaigners knocking doors on a wet Tuesday night for it?  Far better, therefore, to stop railing against the Union and start regretting the failure of devolution.  Despite resisting it, the SNP won\u0026rsquot condemn devolution. Rather, they may reflect it has been a worthy experiment. But, alas, an experiment that after 20 years has plainly run its course. Hence the need to vote for something new with a bit of life in it.  Nicola Sturgeon knows she can\u0026rsquot extract a referendum from a DUP-reliant Theresa May in this parliament. She also needs time to refresh the case for independence.  She knows the middle way of \u0026lsquomore powers\u0026rsquo was popular in 2014. But if that option was taken out the equation because, as you\u0026rsquoll hear ad nauseam, devolution really isn\u0026rsquot working anymore, in a polarised choice between post-Brexit Tory Westminster and independence, then independence has a shot.  So come 2021 she\u0026rsquoll ask voters to give the SNP an irresistible mandate for that referendum and to give devolution a decent burial.  In this endeavour, Brexit is her friend. It may not have given the SNP the boost it expected after the EU referendum, but it is still early days. Besides the economic pain, lack of a plan, Tory infighting and Westminster chaos, it has also exposed the limits of devolution.  It is Nat 1.01 that Westminster is sovereign and can impose law on Scotland, regardless of Holyrood\u0026rsquos wishes. That has always been the case. But theory is one thing, practice another. Brexit has opened a lot of eyes. Suddenly, people can see the electrified fence and the sign on it saying \u0027thus far and no further\u0027.  There was a lot of campaign hype about Westminster pressing ahead with the EU Withdrawal Bill against Holyrood\u0026rsquos wishes on Tuesday.  Ms Sturgeon was wrong to say the Tories had \u0026ldquoripped up the Sewel convention, which says Westminster will \u0026ldquonot normally legislate in devolved areas without Holyrood\u0026rsquos consent. It does not say \u0026ldquonever.  It was also mince for SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford to claim one example in 20 years had turned \u0026ldquoSewel on its head.  However both were right to say it was unprecedented, and both were right to call out the insult of the UK government ramming it through.  That played straight into the SNP narrative that the Tories never wanted devolution, and are now killing it by neglect if not by design. Scottish Secretary David Mundell stressed it was not \u0026ldquoa new normal.  But the SNP now plans to play hardball with other Brexit-related legislation and it may well become the new normal. There are likely to be more Holyrood refusals, more confrontations, more departures from the Sewel convention. The UK government is on a fixed schedule. Even if it had the inclination to bargain, it doesn\u0026rsquot have the time.  The SNP know it, and so plan to position Holyrood in front of the Brexit juggernaut and let it get run over for the cameras.  Critics will call it breaking the system in order to complain the system is broken, others will say it is resisting rotten legislation and exposing the confines of devolution.  Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos strategy might pay off. I wouldn\u0026rsquot discount it.  But it won\u0026rsquot be easy. She could come a cropper in an early general election. Voters might turn against SNP MPs who don\u0026rsquot appear serious about Westminster. A Labour win would rob her of a Tory bogeyman on which to pin devolution\u0026rsquos end.  Making 2021 about a second referendum also writes the sales pitch for her opponents. They will run a \u0026lsquoSack Sturgeon\u0026rsquo campaign, urging voters to bin the FM and settle the independence question.  On paper, there is no election of any kind in Scotland this year, or next year or in 2020. But don\u0026rsquot relax too soon. The great three-year campaign is already upon us."},{"url":null,"title":"information event for future primary teachers","story":"\t\tAberdeenshire Council will host an information evening for those considering studying part-time to become a primary school teacher next week.\t\t\t\tThe Distance Learning Initial Teacher Education (DLITE) programme is run in partnership between Aberdeenshire Council and the University of Aberdeen.

The charity, which is being supported by The Wood Foundation as it expands its reach in the North-east, hopes to eventually be active in every City and Shire secondary school.                                                    The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow. Aberdeen has the second highest proportion of young people failing to move onto \u0026lsquopositive destinations\u0026rsquo when they leave school.        The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos UK Director Ali MacLachlan said: \u0026ldquoNurturing young people at this crossroads in their lives is vitally important in terms of supporting them to find the right path to fulfil their potential.\u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to learn that the North-east has such high rates of young people unable to move onto positive destinations after school. We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing.
