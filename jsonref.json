Miss Cooper said: ‘Time is running out and this is too serious for brinkmanship. Parliament needs to make sure there are opportunities to stop the country reaching the cliff edge by accident. This amendment helps to do that.’  The cross-party group led by former Tory Cabinet minister Dame Caroline Spelman (left) and Labour frontbencher Jack Dromey (right) will urge Mrs May to guarantee that the UK will not leave the EU without a deal even if her own proposals are defeated in the Commons next weekMPs opposed to leaving without a deal are also planning amendments that could prevent ministers being paid and even stop the Treasury collecting taxes, effectively shutting the Government down – a move that angered Tory Brexiteer Charlie Elphicke.He said: ‘A Trump-style shutdown of Government finances is not the answer. The focus of all MPs should be delivering on the votes of 17.4million people.‘Making sure we are fully ready for every eventuality is in the national interest. This wrecking amendment is not.’Eurosceptic former minister Peter Lilley will publish a paper on no deal today, arguing that the economy would prosper under World Trade Organisation rules.          Mrs May warned yesterday that Britain would enter ‘uncharted territory’ if her deal was voted down by MPs next week, telling BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘I don’t think anybody can say exactly what will happen.’But senior Downing Street figures believe MPs could make life all but impossible for the Government if Mrs May attempts to leave the EU without a deal.One source said: ‘Some of the Eurosceptics think they can defeat the PM’s deal and then just drift to no deal at the end of March. It isn’t going to be like that. The idea that opponents of no deal – who are in the majority – are just going to sit back and let it happen is completely unrealistic.‘They will try to paralyse the Government. There is a question about how long any government could survive the kind of parliamentary ambushes we may see.’ Mrs May warned yesterday that Britain would enter ‘uncharted territory’ if her deal was voted down by MPs next week, telling BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘I don’t think anybody can say exactly what will happen.’ She said there was a danger ‘we actually end up with no deal at all’.Senior Tories believe Mrs May would attempt to secure fresh concessions from Brussels if she was defeated, before putting her plan to a vote for a second time. But the PM refused to say yesterday whether she would be prepared to lead Britain out of the EU without a deal.Urging MPs to back ‘the deal on the table’, she said: ‘I’ve always said no deal is better than a bad deal. What we have on the table is a good deal.’But International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said a no deal exit was a possibility, claiming that if MPs voted against Mrs May’s deal, ‘we may end up leaving the EU with no deal’. He added: ‘Most people seem to say that’s not what they want to see. Well, they better make up their minds.’Asked about her own future, Mrs May refused to put a timescale on her departure, adding: ‘I was clear before Christmas with my colleagues on two things – one, I’m not going to call a snap election, and, secondly, I’ m not going to be leading the party into the 2022 general election.’ Theresa May is urged to delay crunch vote on her Brexit deal AGAIN until she wins enough concessions from Brussels to win over rebel MPsTheresa May is being urged to delay the crunch Commons vote on her Brexit deal a second time until she has secured enough concessions from Brussels to win over her mutinous MPs.Yesterday, the Prime Minister insisted the vote would go ahead next week after it was axed at the last minute in December.But with dozens of Eurosceptic Tories and her DUP governing partners threatening to join forces with Labour to vote it down, several ministers are expected to use tomorrow’s Cabinet meeting to urge her to delay again.One said: ‘It was a mistake last month to name the date for a new vote before knowing we had the concessions needed to win it.            Theresa May is being urged to delay the crunch Commons vote on her Brexit deal a second time until she has secured enough concessions from Brussels to win over her mutinous MPs‘All a vote now would achieve is to crystallise the lack of support for the deal and potentially kill it. If we need more time to negotiate with Brussels then we should delay.‘I know she’s saying it will go ahead, but she said that last time, too. Parliament would huff and puff, but in the end there is nothing they can do.’ Another Cabinet source said: ‘She was persuaded to pull the vote last time because she recognised that you cannot go ahead with something if you’re facing a landslide defeat. That logic still applies.’The vote is expected to be held on or around January 15.

It means they never earn enough to repay much of their student loans, and after 30 years the debt is wiped – with the taxpayer picking up the bill.The report comes amid questions over whether the Treasury should be taking the hit for people doing ‘Mickey Mouse’ courses which are unlikely to lead to rewarding professional jobs. Some courses even produce graduates who earn less than they would be expected to bring in had they not gone to university at all.This year, the Government is due to publish the results of a review of the higher education sector, with a specific focus on fees and value-for-money.Adorable kitten accidentally turns on police siren after cop...Party in the USA! A soaking wet Ball Drop in NYC, a light...Share this articleWill Tanner, director of Onward, said: ‘Britain’s student loans system is based on the premise that graduates will always earn more than people who do not go to university.‘But the Government’s own earnings data now clearly shows this is a false promise for up to a quarter of graduates. In the six years since tuition fees rose, at least a million students have graduated from courses who would have been better off doing a technical degree or starting work instead – meaning their loans will have to be written off by the taxpayer in years to come.’ Students are able to borrow money from Whitehall to pay for the £9,250-a-year tuition fees, and in some cases, living costs.Once a graduate begins earning more than £25,000 a year, they pay 9 per cent of their earnings above this threshold for 30 years – or until the loan has been repaid. Onward’s report found that a graduate would have to earn around £120,000 extra over their lifetime to generate a level of repayments and increased tax payments equal to the investment made by the Government.  The report comes amid questions over whether the Treasury should be taking the hit for people doing ‘Mickey Mouse’ courses which are unlikely to lead to rewarding professional jobs (stock image)This takes into account the maximum £50,000 loan for tuition and maintenance fees as well as interest accrued on the debt – adjusted for inflation. A quarter of those going to university do not earn this scale of premium – meaning there is a negative return for the government.The report was co-authored by Neil O’Brien MP and Mr Tanner, who is former deputy head of policy to Theresa May.It found that while on the whole graduates earn more than non-graduates, in 2015-16, 40 per cent of graduates were enrolled in courses which led to median earnings of less than the student loan repayment threshold of £25,000 after five years. In addition, 10 per cent of students were enrolled in courses with median earnings of less than £25,000 ten years after they have graduated –equating to 134,000 students each year.The most popular degree subject area is creative arts, with 126,000 students in 201617, but the median earning of a graduate is just £23,200 ten years after leaving. By contrast, graduates of economics degrees earned on average £48,000 ten years after graduation, but just 24,000 studied it last year.The report authors suggested courses should only be allowed to charge full fees if they produce a good graduate premium.Data suggests 83 per cent of all student loans will never be repaid – with expected write-offs in 2049-2050 of £28.8billion.The Government said its review of post-18 education and funding would ensure value for money for both students and taxpayers."},{"url":null,"title":"Egypt pressures CBS spike 60 Minutes interview President el Sissi","story":"    Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is seen above during an interview with CBS News\u0027 60 Minutes. The interview was conducted in SeptemberIt did not say which part of the president’s comments the Cairo government objected to, but the cooperation with Israel, with whom Egypt has a 1979 peace treaty, appears to be the most contentious part.El-Sissi gave the interview in New York about three months ago, when the Egyptian leader was there attending the U.N. General Assembly, but CBS did not say why it was not aired earlier.Egypt’s foreign ministry spokesman could not be reached for comment.Egypt’s military last year denied press reports that Egypt and Israel were cooperating against the militants in northern Sinai, a rugged region of mountains and desert bordering Israel and the Gaza Strip where Egyptian security forces have for years battled the extremists, now led by the Islamic State group.According to the excerpts, el-Sissi was asked if his country’s cooperation with Israel was the closest ever between the two countries.  Sissi told CBS that his country and Israel, with whom it fought four wars, are cooperating against Islamic militants in the Sinai Peninsula. Egyptian soldiers are seen above in the Sinai in this 2013 file photo‘That is correct. … We have a wide range of cooperation with the Israelis,’ he responded.The excerpts did not provide the complete question on bilateral cooperation or specifically mention the Sinai militants.REVEALED: Black suspect in the murder of seven year-old...Former IBM employee, 57, accuses company of firing her due...Share this articleIsraeli officials have publicly praised security cooperation with el-Sissi’s Egypt, which has successfully secured Israel’s permission to deploy troops, armor and helicopter gunships close to the Israeli border to fight the militants, contravening the peace treaty’s limitations on the number or troops and type of weapons Egypt can have in the region.El-Sissi has since taking office in 2014 met at least twice with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.          Egypt under el-Sissi has imposed brutal crackdowns on political opponents, according to human rights groups. A Muslim Brotherhood supporter is seen above firing fireworks at police in Cairo in August 2013Their meetings have received little media attention in Egypt, a country where most people still view their neighbor as their sworn enemy and where trade unions and most political parties are vehemently opposed to ‘normalization’ of relations with Israel.In the interview, el-Sissi questioned a recent Human Rights Watch report that said Egypt was detaining 60,000 political prisoners.‘I don’t know where they got that figure. I said there are no political prisoners in Egypt. Whenever there is a minority trying to impose their extremist ideology we have to intervene regardless of their numbers,’ he told CBS, according to the excerpts.El-Sissi has in the past claimed that everyone in detention is facing legal proceedings for a specific crime committed, but rights activists complain of long detentions without charges - as long as two years or more in some cases.They say that the trials that don’t follow proper judicial processes and are more concerned with ‘protecting the state’ - a cornerstone of el-Sissi’s rule - than enforcing the law.The detentions are part of a large crackdown on dissent that includes tight control of the media, placing draconian restrictions on rights groups and reversing most of the freedoms gained by a 2011 uprising against autocrat Hosni Mubarak.El-Sissi also won a second, four-year term in office last year after running virtually unopposed. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/03/4E0C52C800000578-0-image-a-50_1531103042589.jpg","title":"Not dumb Blonds complex DNA study says","story":"Family enjoying their vacation on a boat rescues a DEER from...Driver who flashed his lights to warn a passing motorist...Share this articleIt was assumed that blonde hair had a basic genetic structure but the finding may explain why truly blonde people are rarer than other colours. Only 12.7 per cent of women have pure blonde hair, and 9.9 per cent of men. One theory is that blonde hair evolved at the end of the Ice Age, when females outnumbered males.

The Koran makes it clear - if someone defames the prophet, then he must die.’His remarks led to a backlash, with several U.S. radio stations refusing to play his songs. Some even called for Cat Stevens records to be burned.    Yusuf Islam will forever be considered a controversial figure after he endorsed a fatwa issued by the Iranian leader, the Ayatollah Khomeini (left), ordering the death of British author Salman Rushdie (right) for allegedly blaspheming the Prophet Muhammad in The Satanic VersesJon Stewart, the former host of Comedy Central\u0027s The Daily Show, said he later regretted inviting Islam to perform at a Washington, D.C. rally since he was not aware of his comments about Rushdie at the time. Yusuf Islam tried to walk back his comments, writing on his web site: ‘I never called for the death of Salman Rushdie nor backed the Fatwa issued by the Ayatollah Khomeini - and still don’t.‘The book itself destroyed the harmony between peoples and created an unnecessary international crisis.’CORE, which stands for Community Organized Relief Effort, raised $3million at its annual gala, which is held just before the Golden Globe Awards.This year’s event, which was hosted by Penn and emceed by Jamie Foxx, was held at The Wiltern, a theater on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.Among the star-studded crowd who attended this year’s event was Julia Roberts, Anderson Cooper, Macy Gracy, Larry David, Mike Myers, Casey Affleck, and Representative Maxine Waters.San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz received a special award at the gala, according to Vogue. Yusuf Islam Jokes About Struggle Getting Into U.S. at Sean Penn\u0027s CORE Event | TMZ.comSean Penn Hosts His Pre-Globes CORE Gala and Raises More Than $3 Million for Haiti Relief - Vogue"},{"url":null,"title":"Terrified Saudi woman 18 barricades Thai airport hotel room avoid deportation","story":"    Saudi teenager Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun barricaded herself in a hotel room (pictured, today) at a Thai airport, using tables, chairs and mattresses in a bid to avoid deportation  In a sign of growing desperation during the night, Rahaf posted video of her barricading her hotel room door with furniture.

But she was stopped  in Bangkok\u0027s Suvarnabhumi airport by Kuwaiti and Saudi embassy officials, she said, and has since been held in an airport hotel awaiting deportation. She said a Saudi official in the Thai airport confiscated her passport after her father reported her for travelling without her male \u0027guardian\u0027. He claimed she was mentally ill but failed to provide any evidence. Saudi culture and guardianship policy requires women to have permission from a male relative to work, travel, marry, and even get some medical treatment. The deeply conservative Muslim country lifted a ban on women drivers last year. This morning, human rights lawyer Nadthasiri Bergman filed an injunction to block Rahaf\u0027s deportation but it was rejected by Bangkok\u0027s criminal court.    Thailand\u0027s Immigration Police chief Major General Surachate Hakparn (pictured today) said Rahaf will not be sent anywhere against her wishes          Rahaf Mohammed al Qunun, 18, sent this selfie to MailOnline from the Bangkok airport hotel room in which she is being held. She believes she will be murdered by her family if she is deported \u0027They dismissed the request,\u0027 she told AFP. \u0027They said we do not have enough evidence,\u0027 she said, adding they planned to appeal.A representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) met Qunun at the airport and was to discuss the case with Thai immigration officials.\u0027We and UNHCR will talk to her and ask her what her wishes are, whether she wants to request asylum,\u0027 Hakparn told a news conference.He said Thai officials were following the law in initially refusing her entry, but added \u0027if she is to be hurt or punished or killed, we will need to take into consideration human rights principles\u0027.Surachate also acknowledged for the first time Saudi embassy had alerted Thai authorities to Qunun\u0027s arrival.\u0027The Saudi Arabia embassy contacted the immigration police ... and said that the girl had run away from her parents and they fear for her safety,\u0027 he said.\u0027We acknowledged this and checked her paperwork. She had a passport but no return ticket, no travel plan, and no destination or hotel reservation in Thailand... so per airport security procedures, immigration denied her entry.\u0027The UNHCR said its representative had met her but would not comment on the details of the meeting or its outcome.It said in a statement that Thailand had a responsibility not to expel or return anyone to a territory where their life or freedom would be threatened.\u0027This principle is recognised as customary international law, and is also enshrined in Thailand\u0027s other treaty obligations,\u0027 the UNHCR statement said.Last night, speaking from an airport hotel room guarded by security officials, Rahaf told MailOnline: \u0027I am scared. My brother told me that he\u0027s waiting with some Saudi men. \u0027They will take me to Saudi Arabia and my father will kill me, because he is so angry. He will kill me. My family do this. I know them.\u0027They kept telling me they will kill me if I do something wrong - they say that since I was a child.\u0027She, her parents, and her six siblings live in Ha\u0027il in Saudi Arabia, where her father works as a government official. She says she has suffered beatings and emotional abuse from her family, at one point being locked in her room for six months for cutting her hair. When they took a trip to visit family in Kuwait she made her escape, buying flights from Kuwait to Thailand and from Thailand to Australia with help from a friend, and taking a taxi to the airport at 4am after checking her father was asleep.

Colette was way ahead of her time – and no biopic has done justice to her complexityThe shock of The Vagabond, even if one has read it before, is how immediate, funny and fresh it is how closely observed, compassionate but also unsentimental, especially about the dignity and hurt, illness and poverty hidden behind the gaudy coats of Renée’s fellow cast-members above all, how fundamentally “too soon” it feels, even now, in its supple weighing-up of the choices available to a woman who also happens to be an artist, and the costs of those choices. And one of the many striking things about Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, who was born in rural Burgundy in 1873 and died in Paris in 1954, is the sheer number of ways in which she herself existed “too soon”. She wrote novels, short stories, essays, memoirs and as a journalist reported on everything from domestic violence to the front lines of the first world war, from anorexia to literature, from fashion and cooking to fake orgasms. She devised silent film scenarios, wrote a libretto for a Ravel opera, and scripted pantomimes – in which she acted. She was a successful mime and dancer, opened a chain of beauty salons (demonstrating makeovers on her daughter) and was an enthusiastic early adopter of everything from sushi to weightlifting, perms to acupuncture and facelifts. She was for a while the literary editor of le Matin, was married three times, had relationships with women – and with her second husband’s 16-year-old son. When Proust died, many called her the most talented writer France now had others claimed she could have taken that crown while he was still alive. She was nominated for the 1948 Nobel prize and although denied a Catholic funeral (for being orced) was the first French female writer to be given a state funeral. “In the prize ring of life,” John Updike once noted, “few of us would have lasted 10 rounds with Colette.” No film could begin to do justice to the range of her experience, so those who have attempted it – Danny Huston with Becoming Colette (1991), and now Wash Westmoreland with Colette, starring Keira Knightley – wisely do not try, focusing instead on her eventful enough late teens and 20s.When Colette finished her first, autobiographical novel, Claudine at School, she was amazed. “I have discovered an astonishing young girl,” she wrote, in a letter to a friend. “Do you know who she is? She is exactly me before my marriage”: a wild country child, at home in fields and woods, musical, mischievous, with braids so long they rested, coiled “like a sleeping python”, as Colette’s biographer Judith Thurman has it, on the chair beside her. It was not the first time Colette described her adolescent self in tones of elegy and would not be the last.The marriage that ended her teens had not been easy. She was 20, Henry Gauthier-Villars, or Willy, was 34, a salonière and womaniser who in their first year of matrimony laid Colette low with a combination of what sounds like depression (not least because she had discovered him with another woman) and what Thurman suspects was a severe case of gonorrhoea. A literary and theatrical wheeler-dealer, he put his own name to Claudine at School, as he did with the many writers, both male and female, who actually produced the work that made him famous. In The Vagabond, the first novel Colette published under her own name, he becomes a famous painter whose “only genius … was for lying”.But Colette always also knew that the shock of marriage contained something greater than her own experience of a specific man: it ended any sense of independent sovereignty. And that existential shock, sometimes given to young men, too, reverberates through her fiction – from the offhand but sincere worry the courtesan Léa displays for the teenager her self-absorbed lover Chéri is about to marry, in Chéri (1920), to the masterful, quiet short novel “The Cat” (1933), in which a gentle only boy marries “an amorous and untamed young woman”. Marriage, even to someone who is kind and true is, as she puts it in The Vagabond, a “long drawn-out voluptuousness, suspended, fanned, renewed, the winged fall, the swooning in which one’s strength is renewed by its own death”.Claudine at School was followed by Claudine and Annie, Claudine in Paris and Claudine Married. These early autofictions were instant bestsellers: “in purely commercial terms,” as the French scholar Claude Pichois put it, their success “is one of the greatest, if not the greatest in all French literature”. (A famous story, which originated with Colette and is reproduced in the new film, is that Willy locked her in a room in their country house for four hours a day to increase productivity. Thurman, alive to Colette’s self-mythologising, is unconvinced: their city home did not function like that, and in the country Colette, unable to concentrate, seems to have asked her husband to imprison her.) By the last volume, Claudine Married, Colette was reporting on a menage a trois almost in real time, with the protagonists so lightly disguised that the other woman, the American wife of a wealthy French mining engineer, had the novel pulped. But Willy, wily as ever, had retained copyright, and it was rushed out regardless.The fin de siècle world in which Colette came of age was one where performance reigned: in the music halls in the grand salons, where, especially if you were an outsider like the provincial Colette, you were expected to perform an exaggerated version of yourself – which, if not a great foundation for happiness, was at least very good training for a writer. It was also a world in which lesbianism was effectively accepted – there was a thriving underground network of lesbian bars and restaurants, codes and gestures, and for six years at the end of her marriage Colette’s lover was a cross-dressing noblewoman, the Marquise de Belbeuf, nicknamed Missy, with whom, for one night, she performed at the Moulin Rouge: their kiss incited a near-riot. Westmoreland’s Colette suggests Willy had little objection to their relationship because it did not threaten him as adultery with a man would have done. More interesting is to see it from the women’s point of view: intimacy on an equal footing freedom of the mind, and from entrapping children. (Though Colette did not, when she eventually conceived a daughter with her second husband, Henry de Jouvenel, let that get in the way: Colette de Jouvenel, also called Bel-Gazou, often did not see her mother for six months at a time.)Yet Colette found organised feminism profoundly irritating. “You know what the suffragettes deserve?” she demanded once. “The whip and the harem.” She was both a libertine and fitfully conservative. And racist, too (even though, or because, she had African antecedents through ancestors who had owned slaves in Martinique). During the occupation she wrote for the collaborationist press and in 1941 published Julie de Carneilhan, full of anti-Jewish slurs, while at the same time having many Jewish friends her last and longest marriage was to a Jewish man, Maurice Goudeket, who was jailed by the Gestapo in the second world war.A more nuanced position reveals itself in her writing, however. Chéri for instance, begins with a beautiful ageing courtesan preparing to take her leave of the gorgeous, selfish young man who has been her lover for six years. Once you get past the visceral disgustfear of the older female body it is full of respect for women who work out how to play the game of sex to their own advantage: Léa and her friends are epicures – tough, ambitious, independent businesswomen. Like The Vagabond, it is also clear-eyed about the costs: the challenge of living alone of filling days with meaning. Léa, whose currency has been her essentially passive body – unlike Renée’s dancer and writer – finds it overwhelmingly difficult, far more so than her proud and polished nonchalance has equipped her to endure. Another great strength of Chéri is its domestic accuracy, especially about the shifting sands between two people alone in a room, the vanity and careless cruelty, the weird dance between love and clarity – “You never laugh except unkindly – at people,” Léa tells Chéri, “and that makes you ugly”. There is also the way in which people behave, so often counterintuitively and according to urges they did not suspect they possessed.And this, if Colette had a creed, might be where it lies: in an adamant insistence on the irreducibly inidual – just as she, throughout her life, insisted on her own right to be so. Gigi (a luminous1944 novella and eventually a Broadway play that made Audrey Hepburn, hand-picked by Colette, famous, and a 1958 Hollywood film) is the story of a teenager being raised by her grandmother and great-aunt while her mother does long hours playing lowly parts in the serious theatre. The older women are taking her in hand, imparting the rarefied etiquette of the high society courtesan, not least how to avoid “ordinary people, that is to say, useless people”. Gigi prefers playing card games with a friend of a family, a beet sugar baron who drops by to escape the latest tittle-tattle about his eligible bachelorship in the press. When he proposes, her response causes consternation to the worldly courtesans, who are unable to understand her refusal to play the game.• Colette is on release in the UK from 9 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/373008075cfecbc184b6c736d1d37342463c0a2f/0_90_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1890c5b3954d1290b53a6d40ade704d","title":"what are your favourite independent bookshops and why","story":"As independent bookshop numbers rise for the second year in a row after 20 years of decline, we want to hear about your favourites After weathering two decades of decline, that also saw the rise of Amazon and fall of international chains like Borders, independent bookshops appear to be in good health, bucking current high street trends.

Chinese vice-premier and economic czar Liu He unexpectedly attended the talks, according to Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources.Trump said on Sunday that China was under pressure to do a deal amid signs of a slowdown in its economy. “I think China wants to get it resolved. Their economy’s not doing well. I think that gives them a great incentive to negotiate,” he said.Analysts believe the talks were unlikely to produce a major breakthrough but will lay important groundwork for an agreement that both sides appear increasingly eager to reach.“The situation now is that both sides are facing some economic problems. China is facing an export pressure and a likely economic downturn. The US is facing a falling stock market. Thus, both sides are willing to talk and are expecting a deal,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “I think it’s possible to reach a deal before March if both sides talk and move fast,” he said.China’s leaders in particular are under pressure to end a trade war that is exacerbating an already slowing Chinese economy in which exports, factory output, and consumer confidence have all declined.“China’s slowdown is occurring across the board, affecting almost every industry and region,” said Scott Kennedy, a trade expert focused on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Resolving the trade war or at least finding some common ground with Washington will be needed to fully restore confidence,” he said.The delegation, led by the US deputy trade representative, Jeffrey Gerrish, does not include any top US officials from the administration, a sign the talks will be a precursor to higher-level meetings.Chinese vice-premier Liu He, may travel to Washington in February and Trump may meet the Chinese vice-president, Wang Qishan, at the World Economic Forum in Davos near the end of this month, according to reports.The US delegation includes officials from the Treasury, and energy and agriculture departments, as well as the State Department and the White House, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.“It promises to be the first time that the core of the agenda will centre around the problems caused by Chinese industrial policy and the need to marketise China’s economy,” said Kennedy.“If they can make sufficient progress on identifying the key issues and narrowing in on the possible solutions, that will pave the way for Chinese vice-premier Liu He to visit Washington in the coming weeks,” he added.Key US exports including soya beans, corn and pork, as well as liquefied natural gas, are currently subject to retaliatory tariffs from China. China’s industrial policy, “Made in China 2025”, which the US argues violates World Trade Organization rules, is likely to be a topic of discussion.China is likely to raise the issue of the telecoms firm Huawei, whose global ambitions have been thwarted by a US ban on its products. The arrest in Canada of a senior Huawei official, Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the US has spiralled into a diplomatic incident, which includes two Canadians still detained in China.Gerrish, the head of the US delegation, is likely to follow the lead of the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, one of the most hawkish members of the Trump administration. Gerrish has previously described Lighthizer as one of his “incredible mentors”.Observers say that beyond reaching an agreement, a major sticking point will be over how to confirm that both sides uphold it. Chinese officials have reportedly indicated a willingness to establish such a mechanism.“The big issue is not just that an agreement is reached, but verifiability – that China is living up to their end of the bargain,” said Christopher Balding, a former associate professor of business and economics at the HSBC business school in Shenzhen, who writes about the Chinese economy.In recent weeks, Beijing has made some conciliatory gestures, including drafting new rules that would ban forced technology transfers. China has promised to buy more US goods as well as cut tariffs, and improve market access for foreign companies in China. Still, these concessions and economic pressures both sides face may not be enough to bring both sides to a deal.“The US is very wary of Chinese changes as simply being paper reforms that change little on the ground. That perception will be very difficult to overcome,” said Roland Rajah, the director of the international economy programme at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. He said that any agreement is likely to be framed as part of ongoing negotiations, with the threat of tariffs kept in place.He said: “The broader relationship has been deteriorating quite rapidly, meaning neither side want to cave in too much on the substantive issues as they see it as part of a broader and longer term strategic battle.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf9f5e70e1c94bae888fb94452b7a202b559c410/10_0_3457_2075/master/3457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57300ab4e78d911c60b355eaad7f3b3c","title":"aldi uk reports record christmas week amid rising premium sales","story":"Discounter says it sold nearly £1bn of goods in December as it continues to open new storesAldi sold nearly £1bn of goods in the UK during December thanks to rising demand for its premium ranges, the discounter said on Monday.Aldi said its sales performance reflected a surge in demand for its premium ranges – Specially Selected and Exquisite.“We begin the new year with great momentum as the UK’s fastest-growing supermarket and on the back of record Christmas sales,” said the chief executive, Giles Hurley.Aldi opened 65 new stores during 2018, reaching a total of 827, as it aims for a goal of 1,200 shops in the UK by the end of 2025.The success of German grocers Lidl and Aldi has been built on undercutting larger food retail rivals on price, forcing the more established players to react or risk losing customers.The move comes at the start of a week of retail trading updates that are expected to show that shoppers seeking bargains helped the German discounters step up their assault on larger rivals over Christmas.Aldi said it would look at Morrisons’ price changes, but said it was confident that its stores “would still be cheaper to shop in”.“We see this every January, and Morrisons is unlikely to be the last one to cut some specially chosen prices,” a spokesman said.Christmas trading updates are due this week from Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Waitrose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eca23551174b3b1e5e0b8b1c15ed0f23e067c2c/0_249_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20b89c671f7fd63ab1b9a045ab1d417e","title":"brompton bike parts hard brexit","story":"Firm says preparations for import delays are key part of ‘shit hits the fan planning’Brompton Bicycle has built up a £1m stockpile of bike parts including wheel rims, spokes and steel, to guarantee supplies for its west London factory in case of a hard Brexit.Butler-Adams said the group was concerned that materials coming from Asia and even the UK could be affected as well as those from Europe because of potential disruption at ports and because, for example, British steel maker would import materials from abroad.“The most important thing is that we are going to continue to make through Brexit. The rest we’ll muddle through,” he said.The challenge of Brexit comes just as Brompton hopes to finally bounce back from a period during which profits were depressed by investment in a new factory in Greenford, west London, which opened just over two years ago, and the development of a foldable electric bike. It has also been taking on direct distribution of its bikes around the world, with plans to open stores in Singapore and Paris and a second outlet in London this year.Brompton has sold 750 of its electric bikes in the UK since launching in August and hopes to sell about 5,000 this year, starting with Benelux next month and then Spain, France, the US and Germany.Butler-Adams said Brompton’s sales in the UK had continued to rise despite wider problems in the bike market which saw major retailer Evans Cycles fall into administration last year.“The bike market is still mostly recreational but we are selling in the ‘useful tool for living’ market.

Let’s bear in mind that a typical advanced-economy recession lasts only a year or so, whereas fiscal policy, even in the best of circumstances, invariably takes at least a few months just to be enacted.In some small economies – for example, Denmark (with 5.8 million people) – there is a broad social consensus to raise fiscal spending as a share of GDP. Some of this spending could easily be brought forward in a recession. In many other countries, however, notably the US and Germany, there is no such agreement. Even if progressives and conservatives both wanted to expand the government, their priorities would be vastly different. In the US, Democrats might favour new social programmes to reduce inequality, while Republicans might prefer increased spending on defence or border protection. Anyone who watched the US Senate confirmation hearings last September for supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh cannot seriously believe this group is capable of fine-tuned technocratic fiscal policy.This does not mean that fiscal stimulus should be off the table in the next recession. But it does mean that it cannot be the first line of defence, as altogether too many central bankers are hoping. Most advanced countries have a considerable backlog of high-return education and infrastructure projects, albeit most would take a long time to plan and implement. If left-leaning economists believe that fiscal policy is the main way out of a recession in 2019 or 2020, they should be lobbying for the government to prepare a pile of recession-ready projects. Former US president Barack Obama wanted to create an infrastructure bank in part for this purpose tellingly, the idea never got off the ground.Likewise, many observers advocate bolstering “automatic stabilisers” such as unemployment benefits. Europe, with much higher levels of social insurance and taxation, has correspondingly stronger automatic stabilisers than does the US or Japan. When incomes fall, tax revenues decline and insurance payments rise, providing a built-in countercyclical fiscal stimulus. But proponents of higher automatic stabilisers pay too little attention to the negative incentive effects that come with higher government spending and the taxes needed to pay for it.To be clear, like many academic economists, I favour significantly raising taxes and transfers in the US as a response to growing inequality. But if there were a broad political consensus in favour of moving in this direction, it would have happened already.A more exotic concept is to create an independent fiscal council that issues economic forecasts and recommendations on the overall size of budgets and budget deficits. The idea is to create an institution for fiscal policy parallel to the central bank for monetary policy. Several countries, including Sweden and the United Kingdom, have adopted much watered-down versions of this idea. The problem is that elected legislatures don’t want to cede power, especially over taxes and spending.If fiscal policy is not the main answer to the next recession, what is? Central bankers who are serious about preparing for future recessions should be looking hard at proposals for how to pay interest on money, both positive and negative, which is by far the most elegant solution. It is high time to sharpen the instruments in central banks’ toolkit. Over-reliance on countercyclical fiscal policy will not work any better in this century than in it did in the last.• Kenneth Rogoff is professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University.

As comparative lifestyle Neanderthals, we have so far only used it as a glorified digital picture frame and music player, though this is clearly not what it was built for. Say “Hey, Google”, tell it what you want, and a whole universe of entertainment, advice and help can be supplied – up to and including instant control of internet-connected doorbells, thermostats and more.Contrary to their branding as “assistants”, the primary purpose of these devices is not to devotedly help the people who use them. At the risk of stating the blindingly obvious, once we have paid for the hardware, we get the services they can deliver largely for free, in return for limitless access to the small details of our lives. Big tech is therefore able to carry on making advertising more and more precisely targeted, and vastly increase the mountains of data that power its development of artificial intelligence. Smartphones, tablets and computers have been helpful, but evidently not helpful enough. Build data-gathering machines into the domestic sphere, and you break open whole streams of personal information.Facebook’s influence is undoubtedly scary, partly because its senior management seems to have no clue about the responsibilities that should come with such power. But Google’s range of activities and penetration of our lives represents something else entirely. Its systems have soaked up and mastered the planet’s topography and most of its languages. In the UK, it has a presence in the NHS. Thanks to the range of offshoots and acquisitions now grouped with Google under the banner of Alphabet Inc, it is centrally involved in biotech, the development of driverless transport – and, through its artificial intelligence subsidiary, DeepMind, the pursuit of even more incredible technologies that will, sooner or later, transform everything from work to education.Google expertise is also driving the idea of surveillance-heavy “smart cities”, which are beginning to capture the imagination of powerful interests across the world. As all its other activities grind on, it sustains its domination of the most mundane parts of our lives via Gmail, YouTube, the android smartphone system and its monopoly on online search. Its new assistants represent a step into unprecedentedly intimate spaces.So, to use a very 20th-century phrase, what is to be done? The “techlash” of the last couple of years has left Google remarkably untroubled. But even so, you do not have to look too far for ideas. Perhaps both Alphabet and Google might be broken up, and their advertising operations would become standalone companies, with YouTube and Gmail similarly cut adrift. Maybe Google could be belatedly classified as a utility, and forced to allow open access to both its key algorithms and data sets, just as the US telecoms giant AT\u0026ampT once gave up a range of its precious patents in return for its monopoly.All of these things would be worthwhile. But as solutions they fall short in one fundamental sense: they deal with the manifestations of Google’s power rather than the root cause.One glaring truth about the modern internet should be at the core of any meaningful conversation about it. From pluralistic, egalitarian beginnings, it has been transformed into a top-down system dominated by a few big players whose power is based on their control of data, with Google as the king. So perhaps something truly radical is required: a reconceptualisation of what the internet is, and what happens to the data that determines who controls it.As the year unfolds, pay attention to the people who are talking about a new, decentralised internet – AKA Web 3.0 – and the possibility of data being returned to the control of the people who generate it.In Boston, the worldwide web’s founder, Tim Berners-Lee, is working on a new way of using the internet. Called Solid, it is based around personal online data stores, or Pods, that contain the wealth of information people generate, and are their exclusive property. This means they can allow access to particular elements of their data from particular services as they see fit, and move their data from app to app instead of surrendering it (imagine, for example, being able to move between social networks, taking your lists of friends and followers with you). Berners-Lee and his people are also working on a new kind of digital assistant they have named Charlie, the raison d’être of which is the careful use of personal information, to make inidual lives easier and better, rather than the idea of using it to sell us things (“Charlie works for you Charlie doesn’t work for Google or Amazon”).Then there are the possibilities bound up with the blockchain, the system of verification that sits under so-called cryptocurrencies. For instance, the blockchain offers a means of independently verified personal identity, which respects privacy far better than the Google and Facebook accounts do we are now encouraged to use across the internet. Blockchain technology has also opened the way to new models whereby endless micropayments can be made in return for particular online services or content and, if people voluntarily allow elements of their data to be used, rewards can flow the other way. Here perhaps lies the key to a system beyond the current, Google-led model, in which services appear to be free but the letting-go of personal data is the actual price.Just before Christmas I spoke to one of the founders of a Cambridge-based startup called Fetch, which is developing what it calls decentralised artificial intelligence, something that seems to represent a much more egalitarian vision than the one embodied by Google-style “assistance”. In their system, using the internet to satisfy particular wants would not involve indiscriminately surrendering data but judiciously sending out digitised “autonomous economic agents” to get help as and when we needed it. If we wanted a ride to work, or minute-by-minute access to the cheapest electricity, this is how we would do it: via a system that repeatedly connected different permutations of buyers and sellers, rather than by privileging huge platforms that render the rest of us digital serfs.These ideas and models have the disadvantage of sounding offputtingly complicated, which could foster a certain fatalism. Maybe Google’s offer to its users is too simple, and the company’s dimensions now far too big to allow any space for alternatives. Besides, if anyone began to make headway by offering us greater privacy and control, we would hear plenty of protests about how severing the connection between huge data sets and the growth of artificial intelligence would be to hand the dominance of AI to China, where the twin forces of surveillance and innovation are stampeding on. I only know this: that tangled up in all this stuff are elemental questions about how we are going to live. And, even if it can play me my favourite song and tell me who’s at the door, Google does not have the answers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b297740cf54304f575080c04308e5bc199b9cb8/0_29_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cb8b947940c2e782c1d8291dc34ba1e","title":"tribal politics free vote brexit theresa may no deal","story":"With the clock ticking, the choice is clear: May’s deal or no deal. MPs should decide inidually what is best for the nationHas anything changed over the holiday? Yes: 29 March is two weeks nearer. Like the imminence of death, it concentrates the mind.Parliament now moves into that darkly hallowed chamber known as the short term, its walls moving ever inwards. A few things are clearer. One is that Theresa May has the best deal on offer. Another is that only a sizeable handful of Tory last-ditchers and industrial anarchists believes a no-deal Brexit is in the nation’s interest. Yes, it may have been overlaid with hysteria, understandably in the case of farmers. But it does not add up.There is said to be a majority of MPs against no deal, but that means nothing without a positive alternative. There is none. There is only May’s deal, and no responsible observer can accuse her of not seeking a better option. She has found none. The Brexiters’ argument that Britain held all the cards was rubbish.Endlessly abusing May’s deal does not conjure an alternative from thin air – as Jeremy Corbyn seems to think. It is, after all, a can-kicking deal. The customs union or WTO rules remain for debate in the transitional period, as does the Northern Irish border. But in the time available, it is May’s deal or border anarchy.Analysis now turns to the consciences of inidual MPs, and they are not a happy spectacle, a gluey morass of constituency fear, confirmation bias, strident lobbying and personal ambition. In the past few weeks, some serious MPs have broken cover with a plan to wreck no deal by tabling amendments to finance bills. Another group, 200-strong, has signed a letter pleading against no deal. Such worthy activity is pointless without an alternative. Meanwhile the Labour party is in a torment over a second referendum, for which there is no time, or serious argument. None of this activity addresses the short term as it grows ever shorter.If May fails in her vote next week, there will be frantic examination of article 50 revocation. But that would not pass parliament without another referendum, which is not going to happen. Marginally more plausible is stopping the clock, which requires the EU to agree (which it probably would), but which would solve nothing. Even a snap general election would solve nothing, though it might clear the air for sanity.Next week’s vote on May’s deal still looks hopeless, but that is because so many MPs will defy their whips. May could offer an amendment promising final talks, which might give sceptical MPs a way in. But this is a classic case where parliament should rise above party. May should agree with Corbyn to have next week’s vote a free one, and to let conscience ide the house. Parliament is the national interest in conclave. MPs at this time should decide inidually, not tribally. The Brexit debate is by no means over, but it must move on to a new chapter. Only MPs can let it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626f9f64766c136f8ee017934ba73910d2d5a6a1/0_95_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f009a52a7b7d20171addf9c00b621b94","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of healthy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘healthy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘healthy’.Share your photos of what healthy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 9 January at 10am.

Things clicked into place when she made her first short, Nits, a multi-award winning heart-tug of a film that earned a prestigious slot in Cannes.“I remember standing on set, looking at the actress and thinking, this is perfect,” she says. “I get to act through someone else. I don’t have to be the focus. It was a revelation really.” It’s perhaps because of her experience as an actor that Wootliff brings such an acute emotional intelligence to her work with her stars.We meet in London’s Soho, around the corner from the post-production studio where Wootliff is editing two episodes of the ITV series Deep Water. Warm and funny, with a ready laugh, she says the idea behind her feature debut, Only You (due out in the summer), was to tell “a contemporary relationship story, where you really see what goes on behind closed doors. I wanted the problem between them to be that they couldn’t conceive a child. At the time, I was trying to get pregnant. At the beginning of development, I didn’t have a baby by the time we shot, I had a two-year-old. So partly I was tapping into how I felt.”The director’s charming debut feature,\u0026nbspOld Boys, starring Alex Lawther, is released in February.The actor made a strong film debut with London riots drama\u0026nbspObey his next feature,\u0026nbspCounty Lines, is in production.Stars in artist Richard Billingham’s directorial debut,\u0026nbspRay \u0026amp Liz, based on his memories of growing up in a Black Country council flat.It’s an intimate, stingingly honest film driven by two extraordinary performances. Laia Costa, fresh from carrying the German single-shot thriller Victoria, plays Elena, a Spanish woman in her mid-30s, living and working in Glasgow. She meets postgrad student Jake (Josh O’Connor, who dazzled in God’s Own Country) by chance, when they argue over a taxi on New Year’s Eve. The connection is instant. And despite a 10-year age gap, they start a relationship that feels just right. But their happy-ever-after story involves a wish for children.For Wootliff, representation is a key issue – it’s not good enough just to see more women’s stories in cinema. “Obviously there’s a new wave of feminism. But I sometimes think it’s all about showing women to be very strong. I like my character because she’s a lot of things: she’s vulnerable, irrational, funny. That’s a woman. We have qualities that are deemed as less admirable – perhaps because we are in a male-dominated society – so why shouldn’t we see them?” Wendy IdeAnna Perdrix Rosell admits that she was always destined to become a scientist, ever since she first learned to operate a microscope at the age of five. As a child growing up in northern Spain, Perdrix Rosell would spend many hours poring over everything from blood spots to bits of vegetables, fascinated by the intricate patterns of the tiny cells.“My dad and I would collect samples together,” she remembers. “He had his own company, developing forms of pest control for agriculture, but he was a frustrated biologist at heart.”Two decades on, Perdrix Rosell is one of Europe’s leading young scientists, having launched her own startup, Sixfold Bioscience – which aims to improve the way we deliver treatments to cancer patients – as well as undertaking a PhD at the Francis Crick Institute in London, all by the age of 26.Also at the Crick, Li researches stem cells and cancer using ‘mini-guts’ to inspect the disease in a dish.Studies the brain’s neural circuits has also trained more than 200 scientists from 23 African countries.But her journey to the frontiers of cancer medicine was initially fuelled by family tragedy. She recalls the time that her uncle and aunt were both diagnosed with cancer, when she was 15. “She’s still with us, but he died soon after he was diagnosed,” she says. “Since then, I’ve been determined to pursue cancer research.”With Sixfold, she is hoping to change the way we treat different cancer types. Instead of defining tumours by their location in the body, Perdrix Rosell believes we should characterise them based on the receptors on the surface of the cell membrane, and use this to deliver drugs exclusively to cancer cells, without affecting healthy cells. Along with Sixfold’s co-founders George Foot and Zuzanna Brzosko, she has started to test her theories on lab mice. Sixfold’s tiny nanoparticles are used to deliver high doses of medication directly to various tumours – ranging from colorectal cancer to forms of brain and lung cancer – all of which have a common surface receptor.If this succeeds during 2019, she hopes to fast-track her treatments into human trials. Her ideas have already captured the imagination of several Silicon Valley and UK investors, and Perdrix Rosell aims to raise more financial backing during the next funding round. In the meantime, there is the small matter of finishing her PhD, and perhaps squeezing in a rare moment to chill out. “I basically have two full-time jobs at the moment, and I simply have no time,” she laughs. “When I do have free time, I sleep!” David CoxFour years ago, when Rachel Ama gave up meat, fish, eggs and dairy more or less overnight after watching online documentaries exposing cruelty in animal agriculture, she received a lot of raised eyebrows from her friends and family. “No one around me was vegan,” she recalls, “and everyone was constantly asking me, ‘Rachel, what are you eating? I don’t understand.’ I was like, ‘Guys, my food is good, I promise – it’s not just kale and celery.’”The bemusement of her peers provided valuable fuel for what happened next. “I wanted to get people in my social circles to see that what I was making was really tasty,” Ama tells me when we meet at her family home in north London. “So I said, ‘You know what, I’m going to go on YouTube and share it.’” She posted her first video in September 2017. Now Ama has 140,000 subscribers, a fact that didn’t escape the publishers Ebury, who offered the 27-year-old a book deal last August.Film scholar turned cook (and founder of KinoVino) explores her Siberian heritage in Salt \u0026amp Time, out in March.Building on the success of her Mauritian-themed supper club with cookbook\u0026nbspThe Island Kitchen\u0026nbsp(May).The Mexican-born chef (ex-Noma) is due to open his first restaurant, Kol, in central London this year.Ama’s appeal is obvious. She is a natural on air, full of personality, spontaneity and a willingness to be, as she puts it, “a bit weird” (she does a lot of singing and dancing to camera). It also helps that her food is delicious. Sitting in the white-tiled kitchen where she films all her videos, we tuck into a west African peanut curry – one of her mum’s favourites – with sweet potato instead of chicken and lashings of peanut butter for richness. Her take on Caribbean fritters, using jackfruit in place of salt fish, tastes uncannily like the original – she adds a bit of nori to give it a maritime kick. The meal is rounded off with a boozy rum cake that dispenses with the eggs but, gratifyingly, doesn’t skimp on the rum.Ama’s book, to be published in June, will feature veganised dishes from her London upbringing, such as lasagne and kebabs, but it’s the Afro-Caribbean influences that give her food real colour and kick, setting her apart from the ever-growing crowd of vegan influencers, authors and broadcasters.“My dad’s side is Caribbean, my mum is half-African, half-Welsh,” she says, “so there were always erse cultures and food conversations at home. I grew up around different spices and exciting flavours. That’s what I’m used to. Now I’m just doing it with vegetables and making it really tasty.” Killian FoxA 38-year-old sculptor with a stunning CV (an MA from the Slade School of Fine Art, solo exhibitions behind him in London, Berlin and Bristol), Edwards is also a “very dyslexic” father of two, brought up by a single mother on a Cardiff council estate in the 1980s.His work explores the sculptural possibilities of objects in ordinary people’s lives, often by using multimedia. His breakthrough 2010 solo show, Maelfa, was about the brutalist shopping centre he lived near as a child, incorporating a silent film, photographs, prints, models and ephemera. Another project, on Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska, saw Edwards presenting his notebooks instead of anything grander, because this felt “more honest”.“I like closing in on small details,” he says. “They often have the potential to tell us about bigger things on a wider scale.” Sculpture shouldn’t just be about “chipping away at huge things with a hammer, anyway”, he adds. “It should be about people experiencing objects in a space, and being drawn into them.”Shortlisted for the 2018 Jarman award, the film-maker will make work for the 2019 Art on the Underground series.The Max Mara prize winner will exhibit at Whitechapel Gallery in 2019.Terrifically eccentric young artist. Look\u0026nbspout for her book\u0026nbspOur Fatal Magic, based on her Dark Continent project, later this year.Edwards’s Biennale project broaches new territory, however: it includes a theatre piece, which involves him working with National Theatre Wales. He won’t reveal more about his “poetic inquiry into place, politics and class, intertwined with personal histories” that will open in Venice in May, but his ongoing interest in the topic of disappointment has a place, and a memory of being put into a different line for free school meals mirrors some sketches on the studio wall. “I am a working artist because of university grants, Arts Council funding and money from the Welsh government,” he smiles.Edwards also loves being an artist in Cardiff, having worked with the g39 artist-run space in the city he also teaches at the Cardiff School of Art and Design, where he was an undergraduate. “It’s really exciting here. I see this in Birmingham and Liverpool as well – there are more opportunities in smaller cities, and the costs aren’t astronomical. People forget that smaller places can be the most interesting, really.” It’s certainly a philosophy he lives by. Jude RogersIt looks like 2019 will be busy for Lynette Linton. Having just opened Lynn Nottage’s Pulitzer prize-winning Sweat at the Donmar Warehouse in London to five-star reviews, the director and writer is set to take over from Madani Younis as artistic director of west London’s Bush theatre. She’s also curating Passages at the Royal Court in April, a day celebrating the Windrush generation it’s a subject close to her heart, as her father came to Britain from Guyana when he was 12. Not bad for a 28-year-old who only got into theatre about seven years ago.“I’m working class, I wasn’t raised in theatre,” Linton says. “I grew up in a council house in Leytonstone. My dad would always say ‘stay in your job at John Lewis, you’ve got to have money coming in’. I remember going, is theatre the right thing for me? Is there anyone else like me that’s done this? There were, and there are – look at what’s happening in the industry now.”Leicester Curve’s associate director becomes HighTide’s new artistic\u0026nbspdirector.The director returns to the Almeida with\u0026nbspThree Sisters\u0026nbspafter her\u0026nbspSummer and Smoke\u0026nbspmoved to the West End.The Irish-Nigerian poet and playwright\u0026nbsp debuts on the London stage with\u0026nbspStop and Search\u0026nbspat the Arcola this month.Linton is part of a wave of newly appointed artistic directors reflecting the industry’s attempts to ersify, from Kwame Kwei-Armah at the Young Vic to Nadia Fall at Theatre Royal Stratford East – Linton’s local, which staged her plays Step and Chicken Palace. Her mission is to widen theatre’s appeal in terms of age, race and class. Linton laughs at how everyone says she’s “so young” to run a building this should be an asset when tackling why young audiences don’t go to the theatre. “Everybody goes to the cinema – and cinema’s really expensive!” she points out, adding that she does get why young, erse audiences may feel unwelcome: the people sitting in the stalls are often overwhelmingly white and old. Sometimes, she says, she feels out of place even watching her own shows.With Sweat, particularly, it’s important to her that “it’s not just seen by the same people that watch every Donmar show”. The play tells the story of a group of friends pitted against one another when their jobs at a factory in Reading, Pennsylvania are threatened. Brexit parallels will, Linton says, be obvious. “My whole thing is unheard voices – that’s why I got into theatre, because people like me aren’t represented. When I heard about Lynn Nottage, that’s what she does,” she says. “Theatre is a medium for everybody: we need to make sure all those stories are heard.” Holly WilliamsIf 2018 was the year that the world’s ears tuned to the UK jazz underground, a must-attend midweek jam session in Deptford, south London, is where its spirit was celebrated. At Steam Down, spiritual jazz and west African rhythms are twisted up with future soul, grime and Afrofuturist spoken word about utopias without Oyster cards. Entry is by donation so that anyone can afford to go. The musicians in the Steam Down Orchestra play on the floor at eye level, dissolving the barrier between band and fan, with whatever big-name guest rolls through that week. The superstar saxophonist Kamasi Washington loves it so much he’s turned up and joined in twice.The first rule of Steam Down is “don’t be afraid to move your body”, says saxophonist Wayne Francis, the collective’s de facto spokesperson who goes by the stage name Ahnansé. Key to the night is the energy between performers and the crowd. “It’s about taking part,” says Francis. “It’s not really about being a spectator.”Largely female supergroup who will release their debut on Domino this year.Emerging band\u0026nbspwhose debut album,\u0026nbspDriftglass, is due in February.Promising young pianist who launches her debut album,\u0026nbspInfection in the Sentence, at Ronnie Scott’s in March.Since Steam Down took their live show to the Jazz Cafe in October, their flagship night in Deptford has been a roadblock every week and become a focal point for the UK jazz scene. The band totals 12 players, including Sons of Kemet members Eddie Hick and Theon Cross (four were away when we took our photograph). But despite these jazz credentials, Steam Down find the term too limiting. “I don’t feel UK jazz is a broad enough category for us,” says Francis. “We were playing some trap last night!” Musical fluidity is “integral” to Steam Down, as is improvisation. “No song is fixed.” Until now, Steam Down haven’t had to release anything to get bookings. “Instagram is our album,” says Francis. “You go to #steamdown, check out the clips and catch the feeling.” Or you can text their “hotline” for details of shows and special guests, which has helped cultivate a dedicated community of more than 800 people (that’s the total number in their phonebook). But they are finally going to record their music in January and it makes sense that it’ll be during a three-hour live performance. A Mercury nomination “would be nice”, but it’s not a measure for Steam Down’s success. “If someone said, ‘Steam Down helped me go through grieving after I lost my dad’,” says Francis, “it’s at the top of the list of achievements.” Kate HutchinsonSteam Down’s weekly nights at Buster Mantis, Deptford, south London, will return in FebruaryLanding a lead role in the writer-director Shane Meadows’s new TV series was a dream come true for Niamh Algar. “I’m a major fan of Shane’s work,” says the Irish actor from Mullingar. “I’m the youngest of five and when I was 15, one of the first DVDs I robbed off my older brothers was This Is England. I’d never seen anything like it. It was a different beast to Dawson’s Creek or the romcoms I’d been watching. Shane’s a genius, so to be auditioning for him, let alone get the part, was mindblowing.”That part is opposite a Meadows regular – Stephen Graham – in the incendiary four-parter The Virtues. They play Dinah and Joseph, two lost souls whose paths cross when Joseph confronts the demons that haunt him from a childhood in care.Algar fulfilled another ambition in co-starring with Graham: “When I studied drama at the Factory in Dublin, we used to workshop scenes between Combo and Lol from This Is England. So suddenly to be working opposite Steve was amazing. I didn’t tell him that, obviously. Wouldn’t want to give him a big head.”Fresh from Killing Eve, he’ll star in ITV’s workplace bullying drama The Man.Also in C4’s\u0026nbspPure, the actor makes\u0026nbspher\u0026nbspscreen debut after performing a comedy show about her brain tumour.He’s had roles in\u0026nbspHoward’s End\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspLittle Women\u0026nbspand will star in BBC One wartime drama\u0026nbspWorld on Fire.Algar will be all over our TVs in 2019. Before The Virtues starts in late spring, later this month she’ll star in Channel 4’s Pure about an extreme form of OCD called “pure O”. After last year’s role in Desiree Akhavan’s The Bisexual, Pure is Algar’s second gay character in a row. “I think it’s because Shane made me shave off half my hair and dye it bleached blond, so I look quite edgy. I’m delighted if that’s become my niche!”Later this year, we’ll see her play an army veteran in the BBC thriller MotherFatherSon, starring Richard Gere in his first major small-screen role. “On my first day, I got a scene with the back of his head,” she laughs. “I tell you what, that man has great hair.”What does Algar do on her days off? “A lot of boxing. I’ve sparred since my teens. I’d love to use it in a role. I text my agent pretty much daily going, ‘Any boxing films?’”Algar doesn’t get recognised yet. “No one has a clue who I am,” she says. “It’s great. Except when I go home to Ireland and my family are like, ‘Hmm, you look familiar. You’re the youngest, aren’t you?” She rolls her eyes. “I only moved away two years ago. Families, eh?” Michael HoganWhen Emma Dabiri was seven, instead of attending her first holy communion with her classmates, she created a “spiffy little anti-slavery pamphlet called Break the Chains” and presented it to her teachers. “As soon as you start reading black history, it’s difficult not to become politicised,” she says, sipping a coffee in the Hoxton Holborn hotel. “I started reading it very young. I experienced a lot of racism as a child, and reading about the global black struggle helped me contextualise what was happening to me.”Growing up in 1980s Dublin to a white Trinidadian-born Irish mother and black Irish-Nigerian father, it’s no surprise that the social historian, broadcaster, former model and soon-to-be published author has interests that  pop culture, race, feminism and Yoruba folklore. Thanks to her presenting work on programmes such as Channel 4’s Is Love Racist? and BBC Two’s Back in Time for Brixton, she has become known for straddling the line between academia and accessibility.Dabiri says she has been on this path for as long as she can remember, but her first significant step was leaving Ireland for a place at Soas University of London. She did a degree in African studies, followed by a master’s in development. After a stint working in Ghana, Dabiri found herself back at Soas, teaching and working on a PhD. She started writing a blog, and in 2013 wrote a post for Media Diversified titled Who Stole All the Black Women from Britain? It’s this piece that she cites as launching her into the public-facing world. Much like contemporary Afua Hirsch, Dabiri’s voice has been a refreshing counterbalance in a country still struggling to acknowledge its racist past in a postcolonial world.Out of the Woods is a memoir of the author’s religious upbringing near Epping Forest.The poet’s debut collection,\u0026nbspSurge,\u0026nbspis a queer exploration of recent black British history, in Jamaican patois.Notes to Self\u0026nbspis a series of essays on topics such as addiction and infertility.“I can’t switch off from music,” says George van den Broek, the 19-year-old multi-instrumentalist from Haslemere in Surrey who records as Yellow Days. “It’s my life. I’ve been working in this capacity for three years now and I think I’m becoming incredibly old-mannish.” He laughs. “It’s very slowly sucking the youth out of me.”Van den Broek has a hefty back catalogue for a teenager, with an EP and an album, 2017’s Is Everything OK in Your World?, already in circulation. In both, he mined a down-tempo indie-R\u0026ampB groove with low-key but compelling results, building up a youthful following on both sides of the Atlantic. (Donald Glover used a Yellow Days track in the season two trailer for his hit TV show Atlanta.)But now, in his first releases since signing to a major label, his music is taking a (relatively) upbeat turn. The mellow sweetness that ran through the earlier records is amplified on recent singles such as How Can I Love You? He says the album he is working on now will be his “funky record”, moulded by deep immersion in “70s crossover jazz-funk and artists like Leroy Hutson, Al Green, and the Originals”.Watch out for the vocalist’s debut album, out later this year, featuring artists including Sampha and MNEK.The Afrobeats singer and rapper’s single Jumanji climbed the UK charts another arrives soon.The songwriter has had US radio success with her British version of\u0026nbspAmericana.In person, Van den Broek is a genial presence who swans into a cafe in north London 30 minutes late wearing a big smile and a long-sleeved T-shirt inspired by The Simpsons. Contrary to what his music might have you believe, he grew up in what he describes as “a very lovely, happy, supportive background”. “All the strife and pain has come through my own stupid little life,” he says, smiling ruefully. “My family are like a warm sofa that hugs you.” They supported his musical ambitions, which took root at 14 when he started writing “good” music (as opposed to the “terrible Ed Sheeran stuff” he’d come up with in earlier years). As well as singing, playing guitar and producing, he’s taught himself to play bass, keyboards, drums and a bit of sax.Making music is hard work, van den Broek insists, but he can’t imagine doing anything else, even if it saps the youth out of him. “I would have really struggled to let go of childish dreams,” he tells me. “So I’m eternally grateful for the decisions I made to bring me to this point and I’m going to keep giving it everything I’ve got.” Killian FoxAmatey Doku’s career in student representation had humble beginnings. As a member of his secondary school’s student council, he campaigned for better food options in the canteen. “My understanding of politics in a broader sense wasn’t very good at the time, but I’ve always tried to make things better for people,” he says.Since then, Doku has broadened his scope. Now 23, he is the vice-president for higher education at the National Union of Students (NUS) and a member of For Our Future’s Sake, a student campaign group calling for a people’s vote on the Brexit deal. In October, he was one of the speakers at the 700,000-strong march for a new Brexit referendum in central London. “For me, standing on that stage, seeing those crowds of people and the passion behind the campaign was really moving,” he says. His current role has also given him the opportunity to have his say within parliament – he has twice given evidence at committee meetings on funding for higher education.Founded #FreePeriods to help young UK women who can’t afford tampons.Started Black Girl festival, an event celebrating black British women that will return in 2019.The barrister represents society’s most vulnerable, fighting human trafficking, modern-day slavery and immigration crime.At Cambridge University, where Doku graduated with a degree in sociology in 2016, he was president of his college’s union and later president of the university students’ union. Among the issues he advocated for was a campaign to repatriate a statue at the university that had been looted from Africa in the 19th century.He came from an academic family – his grandfather is a professor at the University of Ghana and his father studied medicine in the UK – and so expectations were always high. “My parents put a lot of emphasis on being educated, especially being black,” he says. But, after learning of the black attainment gap in education through his studies, he felt a strong obligation to clear the path for others. “I understand the huge privilege I gained from going to Cambridge. You’ve got to make sure you use that to make change.” In the long term, Doku hasn’t ruled out moving on to national politics: he is a staunch believer that our political system needs simplifying so it can be more easily understood by the public. But he won’t be taking the plunge any time soon. “I think it’s important that people going into politics have some experience of the real world,” he says. “I’d much rather work in the third sector, at charities or organisations that are trying to effect change, before that.” Amy Walker"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ce9f863fb8a231e0326ac0063d9074fb284a2ee/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58acf7bf1bb371aab11ba2529d3610a4","title":"id turned over 1m before i got my a levels the 21 year old online selling sensation","story":"Monty George was 12 when he first started selling on eBay. Now his company Furniture Box is turning over more than £1m and looking to expandMonty George says he was always something of an entrepreneur. “When I was 12 I’d save up my pocket money to buy small things from Poundland like sushi-makers and laptop lights and then I’d list them online and make a small profit,” he says.“From there I tried selling everything from watches to electronics. When I was 15 I bought a load of mini dirt bikes from China to sell, but I realised that if anything went wrong with them I wouldn’t know how to fix them. I’d heard that furniture was one of the biggest growing markets online, so I ordered a couple of shipping containers of coffee tables and dining tables and it all went from there.”But being a budding eBay entrepreneur set him apart from his classmates. “I’d use my lunch breaks to answer messages from customers. I remember one Christmas selling touchscreen tablets that had a really high fault rate and I came back from school to over 100 messages to reply to, which was pretty soul destroying,” he says. “And then of course it was hard seeing friends all go off to university, but I remember the night before I got my A-level results my total eBay sales ticked over £1m. It was quite poetic really.”Three years later and his company Furniture Box has outgrown his parents’ shed and moved into a warehouse and office space in Wiltshire, with a team of six and growing. In 2016 the company turned over £1.06m. “The best thing for me is the customer feedback,” says George. “I get a real buzz when someone gives a product a good review or is happy with something that I’ve put a lot of time and effort into choosing.”Of course, things don’t always go right. “I remember an elderly gentleman recently purchased a chair from us and he left negative feedback, saying it was difficult to put together because he had Parkinson’s disease,” says George. “So I decided to travel to Surrey where he lives and help him put it up.”George says that building a successful business at such a young age has come with sacrifices. “When my friends were out partying at uni, I was putting the graft into the business, often working from 7am until 9pm, seven days a week,” he says.“I did have moments where I thought: ‘Have I made the right call here?’ I remember over one Christmas and new year period, while all my mates were having fun or relaxing, me and my business partner Dan were in our freezing cold warehouse putting up industrial storage racking. But I just knew that the business wasn’t going to grow without us putting in the time and effort.”Now his friends are graduating university, George says the tables have turned. “They’re struggling to start at the bottom, and have a lot of debt,” he says. “In a way I feel ahead of the curve because I’ve spent the last few years knuckling down. I actually think that being young is a great time to start a business. I had no overheads when I was living at my parents’ house and no real outgoings. It would’ve been much harder to do this if I’d had a mortgage and a family to feed. I also think that when you’re young you’re more willing to take risks, and obviously growing up online I had a really good understanding of how the technology worked.“I’ve picked up a lot of advice from family and friends over the years,” he adds. “One thing that particularly sticks out is not to over expand and get carried away, which is easy to do when stock is selling well.” But, he says, he’s still made “every mistake under the sun”.“In 2014 I got a huge tax bill because I hadn’t realised I had to pay VAT, so I had to sell some of my belongings to raise the money.”His advice to other young people who want to start a business is to get to know the market, and not feel daunted by what’s already out there. “Find your niche and offer something unique,” says George. “And if it’s going well, don’t stay still because other people will catch up with you. See what you can do better.”George says he’d like to see Furniture Box become as big as Ikea or Furniture Village. “We’d like to not just be doing furniture, but to expand into other areas of homeware and maybe start selling packs of furniture for new-builds,” he says. “There’s a lot of untapped potential out there that I can’t wait to get my teeth into.”Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Unusually strong north-easterly swell conditions pushed the bluebottles onshore.Gershwin said the striking blue jellyfish lived in armadas in the middle of the ocean and had trailing tentacles and a keel-like crest that acts like a sail.“When you look at a bluebottle, and you see the bubble and the blue fringes and the long blue tentacles, that is actually a colony, that is not an inidual,” she said. “Those colonies also live in these armadas – sort of a population of the colonies – in the middle of the open ocean.“Bluebottles have definitely been fairly active lately, pretty much throughout south-east Queensland.“They get picked up by the wind and blown as long as the wind keeps going or until they hit land and strand on the beaches“Some of the bluebottle sails are right-handed and some are left-handed, across the body, so when the wind comes up it only grabs the ones with the sail going the right way for that particular breeze.“It’s nature’s way of making sure the population never becomes extinct.”Surf Life Saving Queensland said that, if stung, people should remove stingers, take a very hot shower and apply ice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99aa4c4d2f1d15141aa15f771a6d3f92286eee6d/0_178_5327_3197/master/5327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=172d1ab1f04cb731e991305218472425","title":"golden globes 2019 red carpet pictures","story":"Lady Gaga, Octavia Spencer, Sandra Oh and more arrive for the 76th edition of the film and television awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00241a8fc2c368d3c57fa07c48406236bd7a1c84/229_265_2325_1395/master/2325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51717424bdc993c5a87eeb3fa3da2a29","title":"the favourite olivia colman rachel weisz emma stone","story":"The three stars talk rivalry, royalty, referendums and the depiction of women running the country in their new period drama. Will the script’s filthy language affect their Oscar chances?Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone play love rivals in The Favourite, a period romance set in the court of Queen Anne. That’s underselling it: this ain’t your usual corset soap. The script is swearier, the stakes higher. Whoever wins the heart of the bedraggled monarch (Olivia Colman) earns not just a place in her four-poster, but safety, unlimited cake, a palace or two, plus free rein running the country at a time of peasant dissent and war with the French.Off screen, Weisz and Stone are also rivals: both so brilliant in the film – the former as Lady Sarah, a sexy strategist in the Malcolm Tucker mould the latter as Abigail, a bracingly aspirational maid with an immaculate accent – they’re up for the same awards. But that, they nod as one, is the limit of it.“I find it very strange,” says Stone. “The narrative attached to women that they are in competition. I’ve felt more competitive energy from men – at least in work experiences.” Why, she ponders: “It’s almost like sibling rivalry. Or perhaps there’s something threatening about a woman asserting herself in that dynamic.”She smiles at Weisz, who deadpans back: “Yeah, lots of my best friends are women,” and continues: “The idea of the competitive, bitchy woman is a traditional trope from Hollywood stories. The bitch, the vamp … the list goes on. It’s creating a fiction. Everything permeates into cliche. It’s a safe place.”“And it’s a cliche,” chips in Stone, having a bit of an epiphany, “because they’re written by men. Mostly, women in films are fighting over a man …”“… which is, if you’re a man, the way it should be, right?” says Weisz. “Sexy! Watch those bitches fight over me! It’s a wish-fulfilment fantasy of being hot and desirable and wanted by women so much that they’re ready to kill each other. You can understand it, from that point of view.”They laugh, perched on a sofa with the friendly restraint of colleagues 18 years apart who haven’t seen each other in ages but are keen to sing from the same hymn sheet. Stone is a self-confessed “people pleaser”, happy to share thoughts on why frankness is key in relationships and, later, to discuss whether mortality is a luxury with nods to the Bible, the Torah and the Qur’an. Weisz – then six weeks on from giving birth – is game, but guarded. She swears she knows me, but she doesn’t. Maybe it’s just being back in London. Despite a decade in Manhattan, she seems deeply British. Although this is quite a swanky hotel, she swigs PG Tips from a flask.Still, they’re both eager to bridge any cultural ide. So when Weisz calls the current climate in the US “like civil war” and Stone politely demurs (“that was about slavery”), and Weisz says, sorry, she wasn’t taught much American history, to which Stone says, well, she’s right “in terms of the emotionality”, and Weisz nods and says, “and there’s so much racism that comes with it” and Stone says, “of course”, they are united again in eagerness to agree.The Favourite is Weisz’s second collaboration with the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos (after 2015’s The Lobster, which also featured Colman). It is fantastic: a nutty slice of punk fruitcake with an enormous wallop of melancholy. It’s also – with three female leads running the country as the men ponce about in big wigs – a prime example of what movies might look like post #MeToo.Except it isn’t. “It’s been in production for many years,” says Weisz, dry as gin, “so unless Yorgos is a soothsayer ...” Adds Stone: “It has nothing to do with the very important and very necessary movement talking about people who have abused people and done it because of their position of power.”Invoking #MeToo in publicity risks diminishing its import, thinks Weisz: “When you say something a lot, you forget what it means. Actually, those two little words are very moving. Women standing up, being strong in numbers and saying, this happened to me, too.” Adds Stone: “It’s tragic that so many people can use that phrase.”Still, they will allow that the film is topical for its portrait of an erratic head of state, singularly ill-equipped for the job: “The queen is an incredibly capricious leader,” says Weisz, “who is whimsical and changes her mind with the wind, and there are world leaders I can think of at the moment who might also be such a thing. Or are doing something just for their own ego.”A couple of months later, I’m granted an audience with her majesty: Olivia Colman, fresh from the set of The Crown season three, in which she plays the current monarch. Maybe channelling that queen’s reticence, or perhaps because of a genuine bashfulness, she declares early on she doesn’t think about anything much and is a terrible spokesperson for the film, for feminism, for everything except, possibly, tea: “It’s like a cuddle,” she says. “It’s history.”She noticed something similar when filming in Ohio earlier this year: “I was really surprised at the poverty in the most powerful nation. The guy in charge is never going to help the people who voted for him. It was all really puzzling. I’m not very eloquent about politics but I know what I feel about him. America sort of seems like a sadder place. I don’t mean to offend any Americans, but it felt nationalistic rather than patriotic.”Playing all these queens, though – she was also a young Queen Mum in 2012’s Hyde Park on Hudson – has made her reassess her republicanism: “I don’t think I was ever a royalist,” she says, before adding her traditional apology (“… it feels awful to say”).Colman watched this year’s royal wedding from her sofa, crying for joy: “They really love each other! They’re lovely people. I felt this is all going to go in a really good direction.” She wells up just thinking about it.What makes Colman inspired casting for both Anne and Elizabeth is that emotional accessibility is key to her appeal. She’s one of us – spurning the hotel’s Badoit to fetch herself a glass of tap from the bathroom. I make a worried noise. “This isn’t Calcutta,” she scoffs kindly. Ask if she thinks the film’s swearing (half a dozen cunts, multiple fucks, Weisz telling Nicholas Hoult he smells like “a 96-year-old French whore’s vajuju”) might jeopardise its awards chances in the US and she cackles back: “Who gives a fuck?”Anyway, she says, “the awards chat makes me want to be sick in my mouth. I’ve done some jobs before but this is a different beast. It’s sort of a machine you have to do.” She feels for her publicist, what with her client forever declining gladhandings. “I like being at home with my husband.”That’s the other thing about The Favourite. While Weisz and Stone already have Academy Awards, the film is fast-tracking Colman to the A-list. She is the frontrunner for next year’s best actress Oscar, edging ahead of Glenn Close and Lady Gaga after a string of wins. And she’s dressing, if not talking, accordingly. As Anne, Colman is fat and dilapidated, hobbled by gout and grief. Today, she is red carpet ready in a slim black trouser-suit with ribbony bits.Yet the politics of campaigning sit ill with a woman who makes a rule of watching the British Bafta contenders first, then turning her attention to the rest. And who, this year, as she won’t have time to see all the nominees, is writing to the voting panel to ask permission to abstain.Blimey. Most people just vote anyway.“But that feels so naughty. I think maybe I’m just really square.” In 2011, she starred as an abused wife in Paddy Considine’s brilliant Tyrannosaur, which Bafta ignored in its best film nominations: “Very few people watched it and it broke my heart a bit.” With The Favourite “I feel that if people like it they should vote for it and it should be very honest. That should be all it is.”She glugs her glass and smiles, vaguely pained. Colman is, just for clarity, every bit as lovely as you’d expect: “If I’m really honest, I’ve always dreamed of holding an Oscar. But I’m really trying to sort of keep everything in check, keep calm. This is silly. What are the chances? I don’t want to get excited. I don’t want to face that disappointment. I just want to be on an even keel. I’m a mum, a wife, I’m a mate. I’m other things. You can see how people get sort of swept into it and I want to stay sane.“I really value being able to do what I want and that’s changing. That has been slowly changing for years and I’ve had my problems with it. I find it very upsetting when I think about it too much. But if I had a big red button to stop it I wouldn’t press it, because I love my job so much. I’m getting better and better roles, roles I dream of. But more people are seeing them.”Colman’s approachability – plus the fact her national treasure status came from small screen work (Peep Show, Rev, Broadchurch, The Night Manager, Fleabag) – mean people might assume a familiarity that’s actually one-sided. Add an Oscar to the mix and things could get sticky.No, she says, she never had a bad experience with strangers, though “it’s just weird” when people take photos without asking when her children are there: “And it’s odd that they know me and I don’t know them. It’s unbalanced. So I just move like a shark. Don’t stop. Sort of safer. Walk quickly.”Playing royalty, then, has upped her empathy with them. The courtier system in Hollywood is, she nods, “unnerving”. Ditto the protectors and the retinue, the shrinking pool of people to trust, the barrier built between you and the audience.“I like humans,” she says unnecessarily, if not completely unregally. “I believe in the goodness of people. So it is quite sad because it was one of the joys in life, talking to people.”• The Favourite is released on 1 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f78c31dff407837be169b1c87ca3e01d273c7a/0_78_4148_2489/master/4148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91d5e78e7b4b7e4e74f503e6a32d3bf7","title":"golden globes 2019 bohemian rhapsody green book","story":"The Queen biopic and the road trip comedy won the major film awards while Olivia Colman and Christian Bale led a strong night for British talentThe Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody and the fact-based comedy Green Book won major film awards at the 76th annual Golden Globes in a night that also saw a strong showing for British talent.Though his Spanish-language epic wasn’t eligible for inclusion in either main category, Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma was awarded best foreign language film, while the director-writer-cinematographer bested Bradley Cooper and Spike Lee to take home the prize for best director.It was a victorious evening for British entertainers, with the stars of The Favourite, Vice, The Bodyguard, and A Very English Scandal recognized for their achievements in film and television. With wins for Roma, The Bodyguard, and the Michael Douglas-helmed comedy The Kominsky Method, Netflix will also be pleased with its haul.But as the dead sprint to the Oscars heats up, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s decision to honor Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody with the evening’s two pre-eminent awards is sure to earn derision, both films having been accused by audiences and critics alike of handling subjects like race and sexuality in a reductive and regressive manner. Before he was fired during production, the latter film was partially directed by Bryan Singer, who has been accused of sexual assault.Held at the Beverly Hilton and hosted by Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh, the 2019 Globes proved a somewhat less rousing affair than last year’s ceremony, when Oprah Winfrey gave an affecting speech that set off rumors of a potential 2020 run for the presidency, and celebrities wore all black and Time’s Up pins to honor the victims of sexual abuse.But in the absence of Oprah and, for the most part, overt references to the president or contemporary hot-button issues, Oh and Samberg approached their co-hosting duties with a certain tongue-in-cheek wit, calling out various celebrities not for their alleged indiscretions but for their good looks or awards season spoils: “You’re hot,” they told Bradley Cooper “Jacked AF”, they said of Black Panther’s Michael B Jordan, while Oh told the twice-nominated (and twice-losing) Amy Adams to “save some for the rest of us”.Oh, however, would get her due, taking home the competitive award for best actress in a drama series for her stellar work in the cat-and-mouse thriller Killing Eve. The host triumphed over a murderer’s row of gifted contenders, including Julia Roberts, nominated for Homecoming Elisabeth Moss, for The Handmaid’s Tale and Keri Russell, for The Americans.While Samberg and Oh emceed the ceremony with a refreshing dose of levity, the Killing Eve star did take a moment to acknowledge the considerable ersity amongst the show’s nominees. “I wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change,” she said, noting lucrative box office returns for minority-led films like Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians. “I’m not fooling myself. Next year could be different and probably will be. But this moment is real, because I see you.”The Americans earned a surprising and indisputably well-deserved win in best drama series, a category for which the Soviet spy drama, which just completed its six-season run, had never before been nominated despite deep and consistent reserves of love among television critics. Along with Russell, the show’s lead Matthew Rhys was nominated for best actor in a drama series but lost out to Richard Madden of The Bodyguard, the smash hit six-part BBC series that notched the network its highest viewing figures in a decade.In the drama acting categories, Glenn Close beat Lady Gaga, Nicole Kidman, Melissa McCarthy, and Rosamund Pike for her powerful turn in The Wife, an adaptation of the Meg Wolitzer novel of the same name. Close’s speech, a galvanizing and heartfelt ode to women following their dreams, drew the night’s biggest applause, with the 13-time Globe nominee drawing parallels to her character’s struggle for recognition and fulfilment vis-à-vis her Nobel Prize-winning husband.“It was called The Wife … that’s why it took 14 years to get made,” said Close, who’s now well-positioned to win her first Oscar at next month’s Academy awards. “We are women and nurturers, we have our children, and our husbands if we are lucky enough, our partners, whoever. But we have to find personal fulfilment. We have to follow our dreams.”Meanwhile, Bohemian Rhapsody’s Rami Malek upset Bradley Cooper to win best actor in a drama, making sure the star and director of A Star is Born, which was nominated for five awards on the evening and won one (best original song), went home with few spoils.Christian Bale, undoubtedly buoyed by the headline-making physical metamorphosis he underwent for his role as Dick Cheney in Vice, won best actor in a comedy ormusical, cheekily thanking Satan for providing him with inspiration for the role of the former US vice president. Olivia Colman won best actress in a comedy or musical for her tragicomic turn in Yorgos Lanthimos’ period piece The Favourite, whose supporting players Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz were nominated for best supporting actress. Another British success came for Ben Whishaw for his portrayal of Norman Scott in A Very British Scandal.Stone and Weisz, though, were beaten by Regina King, who won best supporting actress for her role in Barry Jenkins’ James Baldwin adaptation If Beale Street Could Talk. King defied the ceremony’s orchestral exit music to make an appeal for gender equality in Hollywood.The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, a breakout hit for Amazon and the darling of last year’s Globes, was upset by The Kominsky Method in the category of best comedy series, although Maisel’s star Rachel Brosnahan did notch her second consecutive win for best lead actress in a comedy series, beating Alison Brie and Debra Messing. “Thank you to our incredible village it takes to make this show,” said Brosnahan, also an Emmy award winner in 2018. “And our village is a matriarchy.” Other television victors included a pair of Patricias: Arquette, for her lead actress work in the limited series Escape at Dannemora, and Clarkson, for her supporting work in Sharp Objects.Michael Douglas, who plays the titular Sandy Kominsky in the Chuck Lorre-created Netflix series, won best actor in a comedy series, adding a fourth Golden Globe to his well-decorated mantle, which includes the Cecile B DeMille lifetime achievement award given to him in 2004. This year, that honor was bestowed upon Jeff Bridges, who took the stage in full “the Dude” mode, channeling Lebowski with a series of free-associative wise-cracks about his prolific film career, punctuating his sentences with the character’s famous addendum: “man”.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse won the award for best animated feature film, beating Ralph Breaks the Internet and Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs. Elsewhere, the Neil Armstrong space odyssey First Man was honored for its Justin Hurwitz-composed score The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story for best limited series and Mahershala Ali for best supporting actor for his portrayal of the pianist Don Shirley in Green Book, the true story of an unlikely friendship between a black and a white man in the 1960s American South, which also won best screenplay.This year’s awards also marked the debut of a non-competitive honor for career achievement in television, named for Carol Burnett, also the award’s inaugural recipient. Burnett, whose visionary variety show The Carol Burnett Show won eight Golden Globe and 25 Emmy Awards over its 11-season run, was introduced by Steve Carell, who called her “one of the most revered, respected, and well-liked people in show business”.Burnett was greeted with rapturous applause by the Globes audience. “I’m really gobsmacked by this,” said the comic pioneer, who dedicated the award “to all those who share the love I have for television”, capping her speech with her celebrated ear-tug gesture, a nod to the grandmother who raised her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7fdfbdf2f9b1e4f164d1816864b1c7ca610dd22/0_499_8022_4815/master/8022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfa8f873587335b04ae4935faeae1981","title":"rachel roddy meat and potato pie recipe","story":"The aromas evoke a childhood growing up in Lancashire, but here the traditional meat and tatty pie is given a Sicilian twistWe still don’t have an oven in our new flat. Things that require one need carrying down a flight of stairs, across the internal courtyard and up two flights to my friend’s studio. She’s often away, so I let myself in, put whatever it is in the oven, set the timer on my phone and go home. When my pocket rings, I run back over. Our courtyard is not unused to cooking smells – in fact, it’s a vortex of them, the ovens and vents of a ground-floor bakery, trattoria, bar and canteen-like tavola calda competing for air. There are also the 64 kitchens in 64 flats over five floors that open on to the courtyard, including my friend’s studio. By the time I get to the courtyard, I have an absolute noseful.But today it was meat and potato pie. The smell of beef, onions and potato, a thick, purposeful and savoury scent of meat steaming and braising underneath a pie crust, and the smell of pastry itself, made me stop and catch my breath. In that hot scent were Yorkshire and Lancashire market stalls my gentle grandparents and the oval meat and tatty pies that warmed our hands but gave us heartburn their house, which always seemed to smell of worry, meat and potatoes and, of course, Granny’s pub, and the endless meat and tatty pies eaten there. Then, as I ascended the stairs, the smell was also of Sicily, the wedges of olive-oil pastry torta we eat there in bars with strip lighting and curtains of lotto tickets.The odd combination of Sicilian and Lancashire aromas came about because I was trying a classic meat-and-potato filling in an Italian olive-oil crust, which some might say is sacrilege, but seemed a good pastry-filling match, especially for an Englishwoman with Lancastrian roots who lives with a Sicilian.This pastry is a good match for a meat and potato filling, because it stretches and can be twisted closed, making for a sturdy and functional pie. Alternatively, there is classic lard dough, which is tender and softly flaky.Of all the pies, meat and tatty is the best and most complete, I think: substance, softness and a starchy, enveloping gravy. The pleasure of pie is the same as the pleasure of a good short story – an enticing beginning (top), a fully flavoured middle and a satisfying end (base). I always wish for mashed potato with pies, except for meat and potato pie, when I wish for peas. I didn’t have any, so in their absence I had bread, butter and pickles – crisp, sweet and sharp – which provided a good alternative to accompany a pie I have carried through my life, across a courtyard and up a flight of stairs.Choose between the lard and the olive oil pastries.For the lard pastry150g lard, diced and frozen for 10 minutes250g plain flourSalt3–4 tbsp iced waterFor the olive-oil pastry450g plain flourSalt2 tbsp olive oilAbout 200ml water, at room temperatureFor the filling400g stewing steak, diced to 2.5cm cubes100g kidneys (optional)200g onion, diced250g potato, diced1 heaped tbsp plain flourSalt and black pepper75ml cold waterMilk, for brushingTo make the lard pastry, rub the lard into the flour and salt until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs, then add just enough iced water to bring everything together into a dough ball. Knead briefly, wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour.Alternatively, to make the olive-oil pastry, put the flour and salt in a large bowl, add the oil and enough warm water to make a soft, putty-like dough, knead for one minute, then wrap in clingfilm and chill for 30 minutes.Put the meat, potatoes, onion and flour in a bowl, season generously with salt and pepper and toss well with your hands. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6 and pop in a baking tray.Roll two-thirds of the dough into a disc large enough to line – and overhang – a 20cm wide x 4cm deep, ideally loose-bottomed, pie tin. Pile the filling into the pie, carefully pour over the water, brush the edges with milk. Roll out the final third of the pastry into a disc wide enough to cover the top, roll it over the filling, and pinch or twist the edges together carefully. Make two slits in the top of the pie.Put on the preheated baking tray and bake for 25 minutes, then reduce the heat to 160C (140C fan)325Fgas 3, and bake for another hour for the lard pastry (cover it with foil if it looks to be browning too quickly), and a little more than an hour for the olive-oil pastry.Let the pie sit for 15 minutes, then serve with peas or pickles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b69ecb372ff826e74c7ffddea9e1df71762dcee4/0_3000_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62daf42190229e2dbc5a8a1de5f5bbd3","title":"thomasina miers lancashire cheese and ham pie recipe","story":"What could be more comforting than a pie? Especially one filled with silky-soft onions, creamy celeriac and succulent hamI always forget about pies. How foolish I am! When you have the time and inclination, you can spend a few blissful, therapeutic hours forgetting the world’s turbulent times and making your own buttery, flaky pastry to e into. Otherwise, cheat on the pastry and spend less than an hour assembling and baking a comforting, calming, nourishing creation that will make you beam inside and out.The buttery, silky-soft onion, cheese and celeriac filling is soothing and delicious – with or without the ham.40g butter1 bay leaf1 onion, finely sliced¼ nutmeg, gratedSalt and black pepper 350g celeriac, peeled100g cooked ham, shredded180g lancashire cheese, grated350g puff pastry1 egg, beaten with a splash of milkHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)375Fgas 5. Melt the butter in a small pan and add the bay, onion and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper, cook for eight to 10 minutes, until the onion is soft but not coloured, then take off the heat and leave to cool.Meanwhile, cut the celeriac into quarters and use a mandoline to slice them as thinly as you can – or just use a sharp knife. Bring a pan of salted water to a boil and cook the celeriac for a few minutes, until tender, then drain.On a floured surface, roll out the pastry to about 2mm thick. Use a bowl 10-12cm in diameter to cut out eight rounds of pastry, using the rolling pin to stretch four of them so they’re about 1cm larger in diameter than the others.Put the smaller rounds on an oven tray lined with baking paper, and prick all over with a fork. Arrange half the celeriac on the bottom of the rounds, leaving a 1cm gap around the edge, and season, then layer up with half the onion, cheese and ham. Repeat with all four layers for all the rounds, then brush the edges with egg wash and put the larger pastry round on top. Use a fork or your fingers to crimp the edges together, then brush all over with more egg wash.Bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes, until the pastry is golden. Serve with mustard and a green salad.Crisp, raw celeriac in a remoulade is a revelation in winter when you want a change from rich, heartier food. A mustard-heavy dressing is essential, then pair with masses of chopped parsley and smoked fish, a softly poached egg or the more traditional ham.

Puel would still have expected the XI he sent out to progress but with no midweek game and no other competitions to play for, supporters who made the long trip to south Wales would be forgiven their dark mutterings on the return journey after a humbling defeat. Sunday’s other Premier League fall guys, Fulham, at least have a relegation battle to occupy them until May but seventh-placed Leicester are a long way from sixth and with fine victories over Manchester City and at Chelsea last month have shown what they are capable of at full-strength. The Christmas period leaves players jaded but you don’t get second chances in the FA Cup. Paul ChronnellThere should have been two 19-year-olds on the scoresheet for Arsenal at Bloomfield Road as the young players entrusted by Unai Emery impressed against Blackpool. Joe Willock, the England Under-20 midfielder, seized his opportunities with two goals that owed much to sharp reactions and good awareness, and was only denied a first Arsenal hat-trick by a correct offside decision. Eddie Nketiah, was nowhere near as clinical, missing three presentable chances before half-time, and yet this remained a promising display from the Lewisham-born forward. Nketiah’s pace, movement and first touch all stood out against the League One side. As did his refusal to allow the misses to effect his contribution. He was replaced by Alexandre Lacazette in the 64th minute, a reminder of the obstacles in the way. Andy HunterDavid Wagner was chuckling before the reporter had finished asking a question that started with the words: “Luckily you’re in a January transfer window so you can bring players into the club …” The Huddersfield manager, bringing a touch of reality to it all, replied: “Theoretically this is correct. Everybody knows the circumstances which we have in our football club, that we financially are not at the top of the hierarchy.” His team are bottom of the Premier League and eight points from safety. The German added: “We will see what we can make happen or not make happen.” A chastening FA Cup exit at Bristol City made it nine successive defeats and there have been only two victories all season, suggesting the board needs to make as much as possible happen in this window to give Wagner a fighting chance, with a proven goalscorer surely the priority. Stuart JamesIf Roy Hodgson’s mood was anything to go by after his side edged past a valiant 10-man Grimsby, thanks to Jordan Ayew’s second goal in as many games, then this could be a long month for the Crystal Palace manager. Having pulled out of a loan deal to sign Dominic Solanke from Liverpool, finding a striker remains imperative given Alexander Sørloth’s travails in front of goal, although the impending return of Christian Benteke and Ayew’s sudden burst of form may give them some breathing space. The Ghana forward now looks likely to have his loan extended until the end of the season, while Hodgson claimed not to have even heard of Sunderland’s Josh Maja after he was linked with the club last week. “His name’s not been mentioned to me,” said the former England manager. “I don’t spend my time watching Sunderland play.” Ed AaronsChelsea were busily insisting the deal was not yet done, but the tears of Cesc Fàbregas as he left the Stamford Bridge pitch and the assorted tributes from colleagues suggested otherwise. He played what is almost certain to be his last game for the club against Nottingham Forest on Saturday before leaving for Monaco, but even though he has been a peripheral figure you wonder about the wisdom of letting him go mid-season. The Catalan has served as the primary back-up to Jorginho as the deep-lying playmaker, perhaps the most important role in Maurizio Sarri’s system. “It would be really a problem without Cesc,” said Sarri a few weeks ago, probably because the alternatives are the talented but extremely raw Ethan Ampadu and, erm, David Luiz? The Brazilian centre-back said: “You need a minimum 20 players to rotate.” Nick MillerIt felt unusual to hear Frank Lampard behaving like a typical manager on Saturday, offering up – if not quite excuses – then mitigation for his side. Derby travel to Leeds this weekend before replaying their FA Cup tie with Southampton and Lampard wanted it known that his squad will be stretched as his sixth-placed Rams look to hold on to their Championship play-off spot. “We’re going into a really important phase now, and it’s going to be test after test,” said Lampard. “We’re going to be competing against tough sides and just behind us are Aston Villa and Stoke with big budgets. I had to give Mason Mount a rest today, but I only have two centre-halves, so they’re playing. I’m not crying, I took this job knowing what it was. Spending the most money doesn’t mean you’ll win, but I do fear the tiredness and I’m not the only one saying that.” Paul MacInnesIn an ideal world, Marco Silva would not have introduced André Gomes as a half-time substitute on Saturday. The Portugal midfielder has looked tired in recent games and this was a much-needed opportunity for him to rest, but Everton needed to re-establish control against Lincoln City and so on he came. That he replaced Tom Davies was no great surprise given the 20-year-old’s largely ineffective display up to then. It was not the first time either from a boyhood Evertonian who, like Ross Barkley before him, is in danger of losing his way at Goodison Park. Davies, with nine Premier League appearances this season, looked the real deal under Ronald Koeman but, two permanent managers later, the picture is very different and having not grasped the opportunity afforded to him on Saturday it is possible he may not get another one soon. Sachin NakraniOle Gunnar Solskjær will enjoy a week of warm-weather training in Dubai with Manchester United feeling his players believe they can now finish in a Champions League berth. Saturday’s 2-0 win over Reading was a fifth consecutive victory as caretaker manager but after closing the gap to six points to Chelsea, fourth place is Solskjær’s prime target. “I think the players are getting confidence and the feeling that we have momentum,” he said. How United fare in Sunday’s trip to third-placed Tottenham will provide the best barometer yet of where United are. “They’ve performed really well over a few years now and they’ve been towards the top of the league,” said the Norwegian. “You’ve got Harry Kane, one of the best strikers in the world, Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min, Dele Alli – and we have to look at how we play against them.” Jamie JacksonHats off to Blackburn’s impressive Bradley Dack and Charlie Mulgrew for raising the tone but the reality is that most drama at Newcastle occurs off the pitch these days. Unfortunately it tends to be of the tragi-comic variety. For instance, the weekend saw an orchestrated leaking of a letter from Peter Kenyon to Mike Ashley saying he hopes his consortium will be offered more time to try and buy out Newcastle. Then there’s the separate suggestion the two consortiums headed by Kenyon and Garry Cook might somehow govern the club, coalition style. Maybe Kenyon and Cook could be joint chief executives? Meanwhile Rafael Benítez seems under pressure to sign a one-year contract extension – his current deal expires in May – in exchange for Ashley buying some new players this month. Benítez will not relish next week’s Ewood Park replay. Louise TaylorIt was tricky to assess Andy Carroll’s performance in West Ham’s nervy victory. On the one hand it was a typical piece of Carroll play that settled the tie, with the Birmingham defence powerless to stop the big man from rising to score his first goal since last April, and in those moments it is easy to understand why the 30-year-old might yet win over Manuel Pellegrini. The forward’s injury record will count against him when West Ham decide whether to renew his contract in the summer, but the sight of him soaring above a cowering defence remains something of a guilty pleasure. Before his goal, however, Carroll had infuriated the crowd with poor hold-up play and two woeful misses with his feet. His case for a new deal did not feel that strong when he made a farcical hash of trying to round Lee Camp, Birmingham’s goalkeeper.

The teams went into half-time at 2-2, and the leaders were then given what their usually mild-mannered manager, Joe Montemurro, described as their biggest telling-off of the season. He spent much of the last two weeks training against long balls and set pieces, only to watch his side twice fail to deal with long kicks from the West Ham goalkeeper, Becky Spencer, which released the Swiss forward Alisha Lehmann to set up Scotland’s Jane Ross for two sublime finishes. Arsenal have strengthened their defence with the Danish international Janni Arnth, who scored the side’s second goal on her debut, but despite conceding only nine goals in their 11 WSL games there is work to do at the back.West Ham have also been active in the transfer window, bringing in the 30-year-old South Korean midfielder Cho So-hyun and the 26-year-old Canadian forward Adriana Leon. These show the club’s ambition – of the other WSL teams only Arsenal and Chelsea have made moves so far this January window. West Ham know they can attract players from around the world because of the appeal of living in London, but to make it happen involves a significant commitment in terms of wages and accommodation. West Ham are at the same stage Manchester City were seven years ago: in their first fully professional season, a spine of experienced players they have brought in complement their own young players, and they are now strategically adding others to improve the squad. They play their home games at the club’s training ground, and I’ve been impressed with the set-up there. They’re sixth at the moment, and will be looking to push on next season.After a slow start to the season Chelsea have gained momentum, and have won six of their seven WSL matches since being thrashed 5-0 by Arsenal in October. In all competitions they’ve won 10 of their last 11 and drawn the other. In their 3-0 win against Everton Beth England, Drew Spence and Hannah Blundell were on the scoresheet, and it looks like the movement and link-up play that so efficiently sliced opposition defences apart last season has clicked back into gear. This week Chelsea signed Birmingham’s Ann-Katrin Berger, probably the best goalkeeper in the ision, and they now have three senior international goalkeepers who will all hope to be their country’s first choice at this summer’s World Cup – Sweden’s Hedvig Lindahl, who started on Sunday, England’s Carly Telford and Berger, a German international. The move for Berger might have been motivated by a desire to stop Arsenal getting her, but surely one of their keepers will now leave this month. Meanwhile Everton are still adapting to Willie Kirk, appointed as manager at the start of last month, but bottom club Yeovil’s form is so poor that, with five points, they are only a win away from safety.Birmingham might not be able to rely on Berger anymore, but they were still their same old selves against Reading, coming away with a 2-1 victory thanks to Meaghan Sargeant’s 89th-minute winner. Birmingham remain difficult to break down and tend to score scrappy or unspectacular goals to hold on for victory. This was a big win for them: had they lost Reading would have been a point behind them, but now they are fourth with a seven-point cushion. They need to stabilise after Berger’s departure – they can perhaps cope with losing one key player, but cannot start haemorrhaging important team-members. If they were to lose even one more, or perhaps their manager, things could unravel quickly – and the job Marc Skinner has done in the Midlands could see other clubs, perhaps in America, take an interest in him. Something like the exodus from Liverpool at the end of last season is the nightmare scenario: they need to keep things tight over the next few weeks.BT Sport has coverage of women’s football all season.

It contained a potato grater, an old travel clock, a silver funnel, a cookie press for making sesame cookies, and clothing. Berman moved to a small studio apartment in Manhattan’s West Village. Her two daughters lived in Manhattan and so did her grandson.One day, she decided to wear only white. She arranged her ironed, starched, folded white garments in totemic piles on white shelves in her white wardrobe, along with the three watches she liked to wear all at once, and one or two other objects.Hers was an “edited” life, says Berman’s daughter, Maira Kalman, and a quest “for beauty and clarity”. After Berman died, in 2004, Maira, an author and illustrator, and her sister were sorting out her mother’s effects. “It was when we were looking at this beautiful landscape of a closet and a life that the idea for an exhibition came,” recalls Maira. “‘We should save it,’ I said to my sister. ‘One day it will be an exhibit.’ I just knew it had to be part of our culture.”Berman’s grandson, Alex Kalman, a writer, designer and curator, agreed. But it wasn’t until 2014 that he acquired his first gallery space: a 4ft x 5ft disused freight elevator shaft in a Tribeca alleyway. He called it Mmuseumm. Sara Berman’s Closet was Mmuseumm’s second exhibit. Then, in 2017, the exhibit transferred to the American Wing of the politan Museum of Art. It was quite a step up for its unknown owner and her humble collection of shirts, underwear and brogues.Visitors to the Met were captivated, says Alex. “We overheard visitors of all nationalities saying: ‘Who is this Sara Berman?’ They expected her to be someone of great historical importance.” Exhibiting the closet was, he says, “a way of expanding the narrative of whose stories are being told, and how and why”.“Everything is usually based on wealth at the Met,” adds Alex’s mother. “But we were taking something that was from the vernacular, that was intimate and from the everyday. It spoke to people.”The closet certainly has a devotional intensity – and provokes outsider anxiety, even envy in those whose failure to impose order over the chaos of their material lives is writ large in their floor-drobes and paper mountains. But Berman was no ascetic, says Maira, and was “very funny”. The closet, like her lifestyle, was merely a kind of “offering” by a woman who “had found what was important” and measured her new stab at life in cherished routines: eating pizza with her grandson every Wednesday in the Museum of Modern Art’s cafeteria, watching Jeopardy! every night on TV, writing a weekly letter to her sister back in Tel Aviv.The public response to the exhibition inspired Maira and Alex to create the hybrid memoir, Sara Berman’s Closet. “This is a book about Sara,” we learn from handwritten text on a cover that features a portrait of Berman, painted by Maira. Her striking white suit and overcoat are offset against a fuchsia sidewalk and matching tree behind her. “And her journey to America. and eating Lemon ices. and the meaning of Time.” The imperfect punctuation and capitalisation are in keeping with Alex’s lyrical prose and Maira’s naive paintings. Along with family photographs and documents, they chronicle Berman’s early life in Belarus, her years in Israel and new beginnings in America.Berman’s existence “was about intentionality,” says Alex. “Rather than an endless accumulation of matter, what she had was intentionally acquired and placed there.” Her actions were equally mindful. The text opposite an illustration of a lemon and a letter states: “Every action was done with care. Every day was filled with precise and Brilliant Actions.”There is a feeling of energy and wit in the memoir a sense of a life in motion held steady by order, routine and stillness. Berman was playful and had a keen sense of the absurd that ran counter to what was, hints her daughter, a difficult marriage. Her pared-down existence “was borne of necessity and sorrow,” says Maira. “She left my father. They had a reasonably well-to-do life with lots of possessions. She left that life. She got a studio apartment with not much room. You can’t accumulate too much.“But starting fresh, what do you need? A bed, a table you write letters on to your sister and iron on – a fantastic limitation. It was the greatest freedom she had ever encountered in her own life,” she says, calling to mind Virginia Woolf’s exaltation of private space in A Room of One’s Own.Berman loved ironing, and so does her daughter, who finds meaning in an act that symbolises the paramaters of her mother’s known world when she was growing up in Belarus. “She came from a small village. Women never walked outside the house. For them, the expression of work was to take care of the home and family with utmost devotion.”The elevation of the domestic to art recalls Tracey Emin’s 1998 Turner Prize-winning artwork, My Bed. If that was an unsettling expression of chaos, Berman’s closet is a paean to the soothing power of order and also, says Maira, to “what it reveals about us as humans: that we need to persevere in this thing called life and to find a way to do so with meaning.”Her curated life and uniform of white were “not for show”, says Maira. “She was beautifully dressed all her life. But she was not vain. It was all done with a great sense of humour and certainly not in a self-conscious manner. It came from a sense of pleasure and wellbeing.”The potato grater, like its owner, travels through space and time. “The most quotidian things in the world can have the most meaning,” says Maira. “What we are saying is, the most humble, the most simple, the smallest moments in life are really the sweetest and can live on through decades and through centuries. We never want to forget that. We like to think of Sara making her potato pancakes with the grater, and to think of her as a source of wisdom.”Remembering is, of course, a way of conquering time. It is fitting, then, that next year Sara Berman’s Closet will mark the Fourth of July celebrations. It will be exhibited beside the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia – “a monument to freedom and independence.” Alex says. “It raises the question of what is monument-worthy. Sara Berman’s Closet is a monument to a life lived with great humility and tenderness.” And an awful lot of starch.Sara Berman’s Closet by Maira and Alex Kalman is published by HarperDesign at £20"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0568e59e6e5914f23a0ed592b4e83a7180224d67/0_360_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b96fd108eda1e11126fe87600318a6b6","title":"syrian who lived in airport new life canada hassan al kontar","story":"Stranded in arrivals in Kuala Lumpur for eight months, Hassan al-Kontar was granted asylum to make Whistler his home Hassan al-Kontar has been living in Canada for just under a month. But the Syrian refugee – who made global headlines after becoming stranded in a Malaysian airport for more than eight months in 2018 – is so busy with media requests that he jokes he has only managed to get out into the snow a handful of times.“It’s very much like living in the airport, all the interviews. But obviously you cannot compare the two of them,” says Kontar, 37. “Whistler is an amazing place. There is nothing but nature, fresh air, wonderful people and beautiful snow.”Kontar was working in Dubai when war broke out in Syria in 2011. Knowing he would be forced to fight if he went back home, Kontar stayed in the UAE after his passport and work visa both expired, and was eventually deported to Malaysia. After being refused entry to Cambodia, Ecuador, Malaysia and Turkey, Kontar – a pacifist and minority Druze from Sweida province – found himself stranded in the arrivals section of Kuala Lumpur airport, a transit zone without restaurants or shops. For eight months, he slept under stairwells, showered in a disabled toilet and ate donated airline meals.He feels lucky to have been granted asylum – a status achieved with the help of a few Canadians he calls his “avenger team”, who sponsored him privately for resettlement. Yet he always carries the weight of knowing that though he has made it to safety, many others have not.“The guilt. The guilt is always there,” he sighs. “I am still receiving hate comments, and that is very hard. … But the hate is strong, especially from Malaysia and the Arab world, even from Syria – they always find something to criticise. For some I betrayed my country, for others I’m a coward who ran away from his duties.”He fights the negativity by trying to find solutions. He lobbies on behalf of detainees in Manus Island, Australia’s offshore detention centre, speaks in Canadian schools about his experience and is using his story to push wider knowledge about what is happening back at home in Syria. But he also recognises his own limitations.Kontar is now living with one of own his real-life heroes, Laurie Cooper, a media relations consultant from Whistler who, along with some friends, organised Kontar’s resettlement. Kontar even got his own version of a Hollywood ending to a story that has drawn multiple comparisons to Steven Spielberg’s The Terminal: his asylum papers came through just in time for Christmas.He lives in a log cabin on the edge of the woods with Cooper, her family and their pets, and is treated as a minor celebrity whenever they go into town. “He’s been very warmly welcomed by the community here,” says Cooper. “We cannot walk around the village without people coming up to say hello, give him a hug, welcome him to Whistler, buy him a coffee or give him a high five.”Kontar believes it is people like Cooper, who has helped with more than 30 refugee resettlements to Canada, who will turn things around in a world increasingly hostile to migrants and refugees. “When it comes to organisations, or the United Nations, or global systems, they have failed us – not only us as Syrians but the Yemeni, Iraqi, Rohingya, everyone who needs help,” Kontar says. “I’m trying to focus on the normal people who enjoy their normal lives from their normal living rooms. They can make a difference if they decide to: all we have to do is educate them, enlighten them about what is happening, and show them how they can help.”Kontar has not seen his family for a decade. He watched from afar as friends and family in Syria married and had children. War broke out. His father died. His city came under attack from Isis. And all the while, he was thinking, “I am not there,” he says.“I could not be there. That is a sadness that makes you feel it will never leave you, it will break you or leave you damaged. I feel now like I’m running out of time, like I need to make them happy, like I want them to taste what I’m tasting right now.”The hope is that one day, maybe they will join him in Canada. But for the moment, Kontar is happy to have been adopted into the Cooper family – and the Coopers are glad to have him.“We’d been in almost daily contact for seven months before he was detained and I felt I really knew him, even though we’d never met,” says Cooper. “When I finally gave him a hug, it felt like my son had come home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e6c871918f9a4e1aa299d80c9cb9e3846e68ee9/0_54_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b654650fb2bc848536e47b9fbdff62f1","title":"drake kisses fan 17 ogden theater denver colorado 2010","story":"The Canadian rapper shouted, ‘I can’t go to jail yet, man!’ when the girl revealed her ageVideo has surfaced of Drake kissing a 17-year-old girl in Denver, Colorado in May 2010.

We can copy and paste – but what is the point if it is a copy and pasting exercise?”Downing Street indicated it was hopeful of securing written political and legal reassurances from the EU in the coming days, before the meaningful vote anticipated on Tuesday next week, although insiders would not say what form they expected the reassurances to take.But the all-important document is not expected before the Brexit debate begins on Wednesday, raising questions as to whether MPs will be discussing May’s deal with all the available information at the beginning of what is expected to be a five-day debate.The UK wants the EU to stress its intention that a future trade agreement would begin by the end of 2021 at the latest, so rendering the unpopular Irish backstop irrelevant, but it is unclear whether it would be enough to win rebellious Tory MPs over.An appeal by Downing Street for a stronger legal commitment by the EU to finalise the deal by the later date of the end of 2021 – ensuring the backstop would be in place for a year at most – has so far been roundly rejected in private discussions before and after Christmas.“They cannot expect a legal commitment to land complicated negotiations by December 2021,” the EU official said. “We do not want to make ourselves legally culpable for a situation that we can’t control.”The prime minister insisted over the weekend that the delayed vote on the deal would take place in the Commons next Tuesday despite widespread doubts that Downing Street has any hope of success.A deadline is one of three elements of a package – along with strengthened parliamentary oversight and a commitment to keeping open trade between Northern Ireland and Britain – designed to address MPs’ concerns that commitments to avoid a hard Irish border will shackle Britain to Brussels indefinitely.The correspondence between Brussels and London, which has become the focus of behind-the-scenes talks, would highlight and elaborate on the meaning of this clause and the arbitration process that would ensure that both sides stuck to it.“We agree with the UK – we don’t want to use the backstop and it will be temporary – but we will not reinterpret what is in the withdrawal agreement,” the EU official added.On Monday, the European commission’s chief spokesman repeated that a phonecall last Friday between May and Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission’s president, had been “friendly” and that a further conversation would be held later this week.“The deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible,” he said. “This was confirmed by the EU27 in our December article 50 European council and this deal will not be renegotiated.”The spokesman added that Brussels would monitor developments in London and examine “the need for additional action on contingency” plans to mitigate the worst repercussions of a no-deal Brexit.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has tabled an urgent question for 3.30pm this afternoon, demanding that she tell MPs what progress she has made in the Brexit negotiations, complaining that the Commons is not being kept abreast of developments. Labour insisted that the prime minister come to the house and answer Corbyn, but there is no requirement on her to attend as long as a relevant minister is sent instead.The prime minister’s official spokesman said that in addition to May’s conversations with Juncker she had also spoken to France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, on Friday , at the conclusion of a week of high-level diplomacy in an attempt to obtain fresh language to get her deal over the line.May also spoke to Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, on Wednesday, in addition to previously disclosed calls to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Donald Tusk, the European council president. She was also “in contact” with the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, her spokesman said.

He will make the address in English, with a large German media contingent accredited, a reflection of how significant his speech is deemed back in Berlin.Last week the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, had a lengthy telephone call with Angela Merkel. He then flew to Munich to address a meeting of her coalition partners, the CSU, and on Friday met the Germany chancellor’s successor as CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, for discussions on Brexit and the future of Europe.The emerging Irish-German nexus on the Irish border backstop “fix” is being seen as significant in Irish political circles, where people also point to the fact that Varadkar speaks German and has a good working relationship with Merkel. They point out it was Merkel, not the taoiseach, who requested the phone call with Varadkar last Thursday.The talks lasted 40 minutes and were, according to Varadkar, “an opportunity to kind of brainstorm a bit as to what we could do to assist prime minister Theresa May in securing ratification of the withdrawal agreement”.But informed EU sources say Brexiters should not raise their hopes of a reopening of negotiations. The “fix” will be further details in the political declaration on the future relationship and not the 585-page withdrawal agreement. “That is locked,” said one EU source.There is deep frustration that the British cannot see how far the EU went to break the impasse on the Irish border talks, yielding to May’s demands for a UK-wide customs arrangement. One EU source said: “The EU was totally opposed to this in 2017 and again in March and June in 2018. It then emerged out of the tunnel in the autumn as the solution, but the Brexiters did not see it for what it was – a major concession.“They are now looking for more concessions, but they just can’t be given. The Brits banked this major concession and just did nothing with it. People can’t understand why it wasn’t sold as a victory for May.“The EU cannot now give another concession ahead of the vote because if the deal isn’t ratified, it means any new concessions will simply be banked again to no benefit at all. It would be pointless.”No-deal planning is being stepped up in Ireland, where the cabinet is being briefed on 15 January on medicines and transport arrangements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14dcc1073eede0b69318a3e0a0ad4cb21bce80ce/0_79_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3cd2f32e29446e61962f1dd4519eebd","title":"i never thought of myself as anything other than european voxpop brexit tower hamlets young people","story":"In the first of a series,  reporters visit constituencies across the country to listen to young people’s views on Brexit. First stop: Poplar and Limehouse, Tower Hamlets, LondonDominic Buxton didn’t much care for politics when he was at school but in June 2016 he stayed up to watch the results of the Brexit referendum. Born in London in 1999, he migrated to Germany when he was three and moved back to London in 2015. When it was clear the UK had voted to leave the European Union, Buxton, now 19, was shocked. “I never thought of myself as anything other than European,” he said. “It was like a large chunk of my identity was being stripped away from me.”With Brexit less than three months away and the debate showing no sign of abating, the futures of young people like Buxton have become central to the discussions – even if they aren’t always consulted about it. In his local constituency of Poplar and Limehouse, he is one of many who feel their voices are not being heard.The east London borough – which includes a booming financial sector, a large student population from the nearby university, and just over half of its residents from a minority ethnic background – voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. But the local Labour MP, Jim Fitzpatrick, who campaigned against Brexit, has said he will respect the result of the referendum. It’s a decision that has angered and dismayed some of his younger constituents.“Poplar and Limehouse voted to remain in the EU. As an MP, Jim Fitzpatrick’s immediate concern should be listening to the wishes of his constituents,” said Buxton, adding that his area had far too much to lose from leaving the trading bloc. He joined the Liberal Democrats soon after the referendum and describes them as “the only party fighting for an exit from Brexit”.The European Medicines Agency and European Banking, both currently based in Canary Wharf at the heart of the constituency, are relocating to other European cities. A recent study by Sussex University on the economic impact of Brexit noted that Poplar and Limehouse would be the third most affected constituency in terms of potential job losses caused by a no-deal Brexit. It is estimated the area could lose 7,950 jobs.“It provides me with a challenge and a contradiction and some great difficulty. But as I said to all my constituents, either leave or remain, it wasn’t a Poplar or Limehouse referendum, but it was a national referendum and the national vote is we’re leaving the EU,” said Fitzpatrick.Fitzpatrick said he was inclined to vote against Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement and cited Labour’s current policy on Brexit: vote down May’s deal, push for a general election, and try to renegotiate a new deal. Other options – including a second referendum – remain firmly on the table.Fitzpatrick said he was listening carefully to the concerns of his constituents, adding: “I have to square the circle between the national decision to leave, the national interest, party politics, constituency interests and my own conscience.”Fitzpatrick is also under pressure from young Labour voters to keep the country in the EU.“I would say with every Labour MP who wants to push ahead with Brexit, the country did not vote for a Tory Brexit. Just because Theresa May’s deal is the one on the table, doesn’t mean it is the one we should vote for,” said Megan Corton Scott, who works part time in Brussels for a member of the European parliament.Scott, a long-term Labour party supporter, said that while she understood people’s reluctance to come out in favour of a second referendum, she did not believe “there’s any Brexit that’s a Labour Brexit. That’s not aligned with my Labour values.” She firmly backs a “people’s vote”.Adam Allnut, 29, a Labour activist and a supporter of For our Future’s Sake, a youth-led group backing the People’s Vote campaign, has been lobbying Fitzpatrick to oppose Brexit, but respects and understands his MP’s position.“There’s no such thing as a jobs-first Brexit because every form of Brexit destroys the economy,” Allnut said. “I want a people’s vote, I want to remain in the EU, I want Labour in government, but I also want food on the table and to have a job.”The economy weighs heavily on many young people’s minds. Nathosh Wjendran, 21, a student at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), said he didn’t understand why people would want to leave such a large trading area. “It will definitely take a major toll on business,” he said.Millie Brooke, 18, who is studying film at QMUL, said the last few weeks have filled her with despair. “The government doesn’t really know what it’s doing and they probably should … But they don’t.” She has resigned herself to the idea that Brexit will happen.Her friend Maliha Anas, 19, a student from Norway, said she was happy with her own country’s arrangement with the EU. “It works so well in Norway. It could work here. But then again, because the UK has been in the EU as long as it has, I don’t know how it will affect the relationship between the other EU countries,” she said.The campaign for a second referendum had the backing of all the young people the  spoke to in Poplar and Limehouse. Allnut said: “I think it should be between Theresa May’s deal and remain. These are the only two actual options on the table.”Allnut said the first referendum was a vote between a known, staying in the EU, and the unknown – life outside the EU. He believes remain would defeat May’s deal in a second referendum. “This vote is a known versus a known. If people have those stark statistics in front of them, I don’t think there would be much of a fight if people actually engage with it.”Scott said many people talked about the economic impact of Brexit but she was keen to stress its terrible effect on Britain’s social and cultural life. “For a long time the EU has been bankrolling the cultural face of Britain, but Brexit will make art even more reserved for the wealthy and elite, meaning it will only reflect a certain subset of people.”Scott likened the last six weeks in parliament to a soap opera. “It’s worse than I could have ever imagined,” she said. “I don’t want to believe anyone wants to plunge this country into its darkest day, but I’m not holding out much hope.”Constituency: Poplar and Limehouse"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c8bbc7ed595ad5b85e5747bb2c127783aa44c22/0_117_3568_2141/master/3568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91d7fe9f2b5a1a3ccb5b18f995a9aaa1","title":"labour backs cross party amendment to block no deal brexit","story":"Frontbench likely to whip MPs to back amendment tabled by Yvette CooperLabour is to support a backbench amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper that could force a government shutdown unless a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table.The Labour frontbench is likely to whip its MPs to back the cross-party amendment, significantly increasing its chances of success in the Commons.The amendment has the backing of a number of Labour and Conservative select committee chairs, including Tories Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, Labour’s Hilary Benn and Frank Field, the pro-Brexit chair of the work and pensions select committee.The amendment to the finance bill, tabled over the weekend, is one of the first of a slew of parliamentary tactics expected to be adopted by MPs to try to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Its effect would be to restrict the government’s freedom to make Brexit-related tax changes without parliamentary safeguards.The amendment would be attached to one clause in the finance bill, designed to give the government the power to keep tax law working in the event of a no-deal Brexit. If it is passed, it would mean that clause would only be allowed to come into force if there were either a Brexit deal, a decision to extend article 50, or a vote in the Commons specifically approving a no-deal Brexit.Should the amendment fail, other bills that could be targeted with amendments include immigration, fisheries and trade.“The risks to our economy and security from no deal are far too high and it would be irresponsible to allow it to happen,” Cooper said. “Time is running out and this is too serious for brinkmanship. Parliament needs to make sure there are opportunities to stop the country reaching the cliff edge by accident. This amendment helps to do just that.”Morgan said that it was time for parliament to create a mechanism to stop no deal by default. “Many of us have been clear that parliament will not allow a no-deal situation to unfold, and with less than 12 weeks to go until 29 March it is time for parliament to show our opposition to a no-deal exit,” she said.Other efforts are also under way to demonstrate the extent of parliamentary opposition to a no-deal Brexit. More than 200 MPs have signed a letter calling for Theresa May to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Tory ex-minister Dame Caroline Spelman, who organised the letter with Labour’s Jack Dromey, said the group had been invited to see the prime minister on Tuesday.MPs returning to Westminster on Monday have also launched a new drive for parliament to coalesce around the so-called Norway-plus option championed by former Tory minister Nick Boles and Labour’s Stephen Kinnock.On Monday, Labour former shadow minister Lucy Powell and Tory Robert Halfon, who chairs the education select committee, launched a detailed plan for a Norway-style compromise arrangement that would see the UK remain mostly within the European single market.Their plan is laid out in a new pamphlet, entitled “Common market 2.0”, which says the UK should remain in the single market and ensure continuity in current customs arrangements.In a joint statement to launch the report, Powell and Halfon said the route was “the only sensible, common-sense Brexit deal that can work” and called for more MPs to support the plans.“Common market 2.0 offers Theresa May a last chance at a Brexit deal that can command a cross-party majority,” they said. “It is also the only deal that meets Labour’s six tests by delivering on Jeremy Corbyn’s call for a customs union and a strong single market deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e09213b6c3a99911f887ce2894dbc5f4f2c88c2e/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c55bdd72a92ced84e07c4c9f974ffd02","title":"no deal brexit rehearsal tests traffic congestion in kent","story":"Only 89 trucks take part in trial of emergency traffic system designed to cope with 6,000 vehicles A live rehearsal of an emergency traffic system that will be put in place to prevent congestion in Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit has been described as “a waste of time” by drivers participating in the test in Kent on Monday.The Road Haulage Association said the dry run of a contingency traffic plan for the port was “too little too late”.The location for the Department for Transport’s trial was a disused airport north of the Kent port that was once used to test the bouncing bombs employed in the “Dambuster” raids in the second world war.Under contingency plans, Manston airport will be used as a parking facility for 6,000 lorries, but only 89 participated in the trial staged at 8am on Monday.The lorries started their journey at dawn at the airport, where they queued before being given the goahead to drive to a second holding area, a three-mile stretch of the A256, which had been coned off to normal traffic.From there they were directed en masse to Dover, Britain’s biggest roll-on-roll-off port that handles about 10,000 lorries a day.After the first dry run drivers said while it was good the government was doing something the exercise was so small it was pointless.“It’s a waste of time. They should have done it in rush-hour. You can see the traffic here is just average. This is not what it will be like in no-deal,” said Adam Carter, a driver with Int Logistics.It took about an hour for lorries to make the 33-mile journey to Dover and it appeared to go smoothly with no queues evident en route.“To be honest, it was a waste of time. At least they have done something and it worked, but 80 trucks from our point of view isn’t testing the system,” said David Martin, who is also a driver with Int Logistics.He said the government’s contingency plan would create huge expense for drivers in petrol and other costs, particularly those who would be forced to go to Manston airport even if their final transit point was the Eurotunnel, several miles up the coast from Dover.“When you’re doing that extra 40 miles two or three times a week and at eight miles to the gallon, it all adds up,” added Martin, whose company transports frozen and chilled food including cheese and yoghurt from the continent to British supermarkets.The Calais politician Xavier Bertrand has said a two-minute delay would lead to a 27,000-strong queue on both sides of the channel.And the Road Haulage Association has said the documentation required if the UK leaves the single market is so impractical it would take eight hours per truck to complete. The challenge facing the government and Kent county council was evident at dawn as an argument broke out between marshals about where the trucks were supposed to go.The association described the test as “window dressing”, saying it could not possibly mimic the reality of 6,000 trucks that would be held at Manston airport in the event of no deal.“This is designed to test what happens if there is no deal and Operation Brock is implemented,” said a spokesman referring to the codename for the Brexit traffic management plan.Kent county council has warned a no-deal Brexit could cause major disruption across Kent, with gridlock on the roads around Dover.Rod McKenzie, the managing director of policy for the Road Haulage Association, said the rehearsal was too limited in scope.“Critics might call it window dressing,” he said. “With 89 trucks, in no way can it replicate a potential 6,000 trucks that might need to be held in or around Kent and Manston. This planning should have been done many months ago, and preferably on a bigger scale. It should have been continuous and stress-tested, I doubt many truck drivers will be impressed by this.“What we need is a deal or at least a transition deal. Business is simply not ready for a cliff-edge Brexit,” he said.Local driver Jim Andrews said it was a good idea to use the route from Manston airport but questioned the leadership of Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, on no-deal planning for Kent, which will bear the brunt of traffic disruption.“I love my country, but we are a nation of lions led by donkeys. Nobody asks us, the people in Kent, the drivers, what we think,” said Andrews, a supporter of Brexit.Neil Wheeler, an NHS security official who was at a truckers’ stop along the route, said he was concerned about emergency services. “If you have gridlock and you have an accident on the road, I do not see how you will be able to get to hospital,” he said.Staff at the nearby McDonalds said local drivers had steered clear of the area this morning. “Everyone new this was happened, so stayed away. It’s been very quiet,” said one.A DfT spokesman said it did not expect a no-deal scenario, but it was “the duty of a responsible government to continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies, including a possible no deal”.He added that “any lessons learned from today and further mitigation measures will be considered carefully” to ensure the system was fully functional if needed.

And it doesn’t have to break the bank.Scattering plants around the officeYou don’t need to be a botanist to realise the positive effect plants can have on an environment, and the workplace is no different. Plants that have been shown to have a de-stressing effect include aloe vera, peace lilies, bamboo palm, spider plants and rubber trees. Try dotting a few of these on your desk and around the office and see what the effect is on people’s moods.Allowing petsThe act of stroking a dog has been shown to increase levels of a hormone called oxytocin in both the dog and the human, while reducing cortisol levels in the person, too. Oxytocin is a happy hormone, whereas, cortisol is related to stress. So stroking dogs makes you happier and less stressed.At the UK Mars Petcare offices, dogs are a constant feature. “What’s amazing about having dogs in the office is the genuine relationship of support that can build over time between people and pets,” says Essler, who also works at a pet care company.“I often notice people taking short breaks in their day to stroke, cuddle or play with the dogs, which relieves their stress and over time builds a positive bond with the dog,” she says. “This unconditional relationship is extremely beneficial in challenging environments and often I see dogs seeking to comfort those who are having a difficult day.”Creating a stress-free zoneTaking time away from the threat – or perceived threat – that’s making you stressed has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to overcome it. This is why having a separate area that people can go to when they feel overwhelmed will help improve the wellbeing of people in your office. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy it might be a coffee area or simply a corner of the office with beanbags or cushions.Socialising“We’re only a small team, but spending time together outside of the workplace to relax, bond, laugh and reflect has improved productivity and team dynamics endlessly,” says Ben Barker, founder of cold-brew coffee company Artemis Brew.“It can be as simple, cheap and non-disruptive as you make it,” he says. His team has been to events such as escape rooms and independent film festivals, and it usually involves a beer or two afterwards.Playing musicMusic can be comforting, relaxing and it has been shown to increase productivity. Instead of having everyone listening to their own music through headphones, try playing music in your office to help people feel less stressed.“We have the radio playing in all areas of the building,” says Tracey Dawson, managing director at Daletech Electronics, a company with 14 employees.Or, if you’re in the mood for something a bit different, why not try a podcast?“We love having music on in the office, but more recently we’ve been putting podcasts on, too, which are a great alternative,” says James Gupta, founder and CEO at Synap, an online education platform.Communication is keyMaking sure everyone knows what is going on helps to manage stress, says Gupta. “At the beginning of every week, we have a team meeting to discuss what we’ll each be working on,” he says. “The development team get to see how their work is being received by customers, and the sales team have an understanding of when new features are likely to be available.”Provide healthy snacks“We try to encourage active, healthy lifestyles, so we supply free fruit and we have a company lunch together once a week,” says Dawson.Healthy eating has been shown to help stress levels decrease, and if someone is working to a deadline, having a quick, healthy snack might be exactly what they need to get through a busy morning. Offering caffeine-free alternatives to tea and coffee can also help keep tempers from boiling over and keep the jitters at bay.Celebrate success“Celebrating success is important,” says Gillian Rattray, entrepreneur acceleration manager at Royal Bank of Scotland.Recognising small wins such as hitting certain revenue targets or securing an important meeting helps even out the rollercoaster of running a business. “At the moment, we are looking carefully at celebration,” says Dawson. “As a first step, we have installed a ship’s bell that we ring each time an order leaves the building.”“In my own business, we had fizz days – we bought a bottle of sparkling wine when we made £1,000 or more in a day,” says Rattray. “The more revenue we earned, the more fizz we bought!”SEAT believes in helping people move forward.

But spare a thought for the Chicago Bears kickerIt was the double-doink heard around the world. Cody Parkey, for the sixth time this season, hit the upright … and then the crossbar. His failed attempt at a game-winning field goal had cost the Chicago Bears a come-from-behind playoff win over the Philadelphia Eagles.The odds of a kicker hitting the uprights six times in one season are so absurd few watching could believe it had happened, but perhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised after an exhilarating game. There was great offense and defense. There were officiating snafus, busted coverages, creative play calls, great clock management, and terrible clock management. Moments of utter brutality were interspersed with astonishing feats of athleticism. We witnessed football near its finest.And it ended as these things so often do, with the smallest man on the team jogging to midfield, to hoof a ball between a pair of yellow sticks, a concept that still feels alien to the rest of the enterprise it must be the loneliest feeling in sports.Parkey’s miss will come to define the game. But his is not the most interesting story. Nick Foles’s is. Again. Foles is now 6-0 in must-win games – running the table this season to get the defending champs back to the postseason. And still – still! – there are doubters. You are reading one now. Foles’s December-to-January greatness has become so hard to explain that we may as well stop trying.He wasn’t perfect on Sunday. As ever, Big Nick attempted Big Nick throws, which usually include a 300lbs behemoth barreling towards his chest. Somehow, improbably, he completes more of those throws than any quarterback in the league: Foles is top of the NFL’s ratings for passes made on contact. But those kinds of throws will come back to bite a player every now and then. Foles tossed a couple of interceptions against the league’s best defense, including an awful ball delivered with four defenders converging on his intended receiver.But Foles kept coming. In what would likely have been his final game for the team had they lost, he engineered the perfect two-minute drill to put Philly up by a point with under a minute to go. It was a lead they would not relinquish.Chicago could not have done much more. Their defense was excellent for most of the game. Indeed, the prevailing wisdom heading into the postseason was that Chicago’s defense would carry quarterback Mitch Trubisky and the offense. Not so: Trubisky played exceptionally, making clutch throw after clutch against a complex defense with all the savvy of a playoff veteran.Halted by an early leg injury, Trubisky didn’t have his usual wheels, a key element in the Bears offense. He was forced to play from inside the pocket. The ball came out quickly, on-time and in rhythm. He picked on the Eagles’ young defensive backs, hitting big, important shots downfield. After Foles’ gut-check drive, Trubisky responded in-kind: delivering the play of the night on a corner route to Allen Robinson to put the Bears into game-winning position:There are a handful of quarterbacks walking the Earth who have the velocity, touch, and precision to make the kind of throw in the video above. Apparently, Trubisky is one of them.If only he had a kicker. That may be a little harsh: Parkey was a lucky bounce away from being the hero. Now, he will be the pariah. “I feel terrible,” Parkey said after the game. “I thought I hit a good ball”. Fortunately for him, it’s not like Chicago has a history of vilifying an inidual for a loss in a team sport.Foles and the Eagles will move on to face the New Orleans Saints, looking for a seventh win in a row in win-or-go-home games. This really is a weird and wonderful game.The NFL couldn’t get through a weekend without a series of replay review blunders. The most bizarre came in Chicago, with our first ever catch-fumble-incomplete play:Without a clear recovery, the fumble was ruled as an incomplete pass rather than given back to the Bears at the spot of the fumble. The ruling was correct, though announced poorly by the on-field referee, and is merely a quirk of a protracted rulebook. It was the strangest replay review the league had seen for at least two hours.Next week we get to see this guy:Melvin Ingram, Los Angeles Chargers. This could and probably should go to the entire Chargers defense. Entering the fourth quarter on Sunday, the Ravens had negative passing yards. The Chargers had more sacks (six) than the Ravens had first downs (four).Ingram was the star of the show in the Chargers’ win. The pass-rusher racked up two sacks, two quarterback hits, and recovered a game-clinching fumble. Like Joey Bosa, his marvelous running mate, Ingram shuffles right across LA’s front. The pair took turns clowning each member of the Ravens’ offensive line.15. Lamar Jackson’s game-sealing fumble was his 15th of the season. No player had more fumbles in 2018 than Jackson, even though he started less than half the season. Sunday proved Jackson has plenty of flaws to address, but holding onto the ball is the most essential.“You can call it what you want” – Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin on reports star wide receiver Antonio Brown has requested a trade.As Ron Burgundy would say, that escalated quickly. The drip, drip, drip of information out of Pittsburgh this week has been as compelling as it has been absurd. I’m all for player empowerment, and I side with labor over management on many of the issues that dog the NFL. But, come on, you have to at least show up for the job you’re paid to do.A new report suggests the Steelers will ship Brown out of Pittsburgh by 13 March – the start of the new league year. Finding a credible landing spot is tough. Only the Jets and Bills have the cap room and need, without sacrificing a serious amount of their current roster. And what incentive do the Steelers have exactly? Brown will cost the team the same amount regardless of whether he’s on the roster or not — a $25m cap charge.Moving on from a “distraction” is the kind of thing fans crow about on Twitter. Smart teams like the Steelers don’t typically succumb to that kind of pressure they make analytical decisions, not emotional ones. But this time feels different. This time feels far more combustible. Management is siding with its coach and quarterback, which other members of the team – most notably Brown and Le’Veon Bell – view as an extension of management itself. There is distrust throughout the organization. Something will give.-- On Saturday night, the Seahawks limited Russell Wilson to 21 pre-final drive pass attempts during their loss in Dallas. Their running backs carried the ball 21 times for 59 yards (2.81 YPC). Wilson averaged 8.6 yards per pass attempt. Yikes. At least they established the run and showed their identity, right?-- Remember the Josh McDaniels-Indianapolis Colts will-he-won’t-he saga? That feels like a million years ago. Frank Reich was the afterthought, not even the team’s second choice, and now they’re in the isional playoffs. Sometimes the best deals in life are the ones you don’t make.-- Think about this: the 12-4 Chargers traveled all the way to Baltimore to beat the 10-6 Ravens. Now, they get to travel all the way to New England to play the 11-5 Patriots. The Chargers worked all season to secure the second-best record in their conference. They’ve been rewarded with two cross-country trips, one an early kickoff. The NFL needs to rethink its playoff seedings. Guarantee ision winners a spot in the playoffs, but seed the tournament by overall record."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5763960a213df47cb969d5be2863dcf169ee8d73/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59f0724e8c863550b0fc013c693a2ff4","title":"simona halep dream best tennis donald mcrae interview","story":"The world No 1 on how winning her first grand slam finally lifted the pressure on her shoulders and allowed her to relax as a person“Everything I did in life, until now, was just for tennis. Nothing else mattered. That’s why it became too much, maybe. That’s why I suffered,” Simona Halep says intently on a mid-winter afternoon in Bucharest. We sit in a corner of a restaurant where the chink of cutlery provides a refined backdrop to the raw immediacy of a rare interview with the world No 1.There is snow on the ground outside but only warmth from Halep. Beyond her burning intensity she smiles with relief. “There is no pressure now. I feel lighter. I feel better. I wouldn’t have been this relaxed if I hadn’t won the French Open. A big weight is off my shoulders.”The 27-year-old has avoided opening up before because, apart from being shy and private, she was consumed by a fixation she finally quenched in Paris last summer when winning her first grand slam. Halep can now offer insight into her life in Bucharest.We meet at 9am and she chats cheerfully while we are driven to an indoor court on the outskirts of the city. I watch her practise for the Australian Open, which begins next week in the contrasting furnace of Melbourne, where Halep suffered so much last year. On the way to lunch, with Halep drained after playing hard for two hours, she finds pleasure in the simple fact she spent her first Christmas at home in 10 years.Halep now appears the opposite of a one-dimensional obsessive. Instead, as she reflects on the dedication needed to reach her goals, she talks expansively about physical trauma, psychological barriers, the role of her former coach, Darren Cahill, and the sweetness of victory.Cahill will spend most of this year with his family in Australia and so Halep is currently without a coach. This unusual situation adds to her fascination as to whether, while returning from a back injury and exhaustion after her momentous 2018, she can become an even better player.Halep’s psychological resolve has been tested but at last year’s Australian Open she was subjected to a physical battering which meant she was taken to hospital after her draining three-set defeat in the final against Caroline Wozniacki. The entire tournament had been an ordeal. “I have never played such a tough tournament and I hope I will not have to again,” she says. “It was a disaster. My mum was scared and she said I must never do that again because it was too much. It was a warning.”She had twisted her ankle badly in the first round but struggled on and won two matches before facing Lauren Davis. They played for three hours 45 minutes in searing heat, costing Davis some of her toenails, before Halep won 15-13 in the final set. “That was amazing,” Halep says. “She played so well and had three match points. But I think I had more desire to win. That match meant a lot because mentally I was strong. I could stay so many hours on court.”Just over four months later she was about to be examined psychologically rather than just physically in Paris. A fourth successive defeat in a major final would have felt ruinous – especially as Halep had lost the French Open the previous year when a set and 3-0 up in the final against Jelena Ostapenko. “I have the courage to say I lost that final,” she says. “She won it in the end because she was great and when you are young you just play. I lost it because I couldn’t handle the emotions. For the next three months I cannot use the word ‘depressed’ because it’s too much. But I was sad for a long time.”In the 2018 French Open final, Halep was a set and 2-0 down to an inspired Sloane Stephens. “I didn’t expect her to play so well on clay so I thought everything will be lost again,” she admits. “I said I have to try something so I was more aggressive. I went to the net three times in one game, which I never do. I won the game and I had the confidence because I thought about the year before when I was leading and lost it. I really believed then.”Halep’s face lights up as she remembers how 20 years of grinding work had finally given her the ultimate happiness she craved on court. “Everything I had dreamed was real in that moment. All the people I love were there and when I lift the trophy, and the national song is played, it was the best moment I ever had. I was crying because it was huge. Maybe it will be my best moment as an athlete. But let’s see. Maybe the future will give me even more.”That future is made intriguing by Halep’s decision not to replace Cahill immediately. In explaining how much he helped her overcome mentally, Halep suggests her personal challenge is shared by many Romanians. “People here don’t believe in themselves much. We are very talented but we don’t have confidence. I was lucky. Darren is Australian and totally different. He pushed me to be positive. I changed a lot.”Can she succeed without a coach? “No, I need to find a coach. At this level it is impossible to go alone.”Will she and Cahill be reunited? “I don’t know. I can say I hope so because he’s a great person and that matters the most.”Her rise is remarkable because, apart from her Romanian background giving her few advantages, Halep also describes her character as a girl. “Sometimes I was crying that I don’t want to go on the court because I was too shy. I was very introverted. I am still an introvert.”Halep smiles when I say she has been confident and revealing in this interview. “I am open now. I improved a lot and I can be more natural.”She has begun to support young Romanian players hoping to make it on the pro circuit. “I received a lot from tennis so it’s good to help others because it’s very difficult. Many talented kids get lost because they don’t have the money. Tennis is an expensive sport in Romania.”Halep also supports a girls’ ice hockey team. “I am paying for everything they need – equipment, coaches, some tournaments outside of Romania. They started to beat the boys so it’s good. Sometimes I go see them for the energy and to get motivated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82bd740017daf4e88dc74475804c627faef74612/0_59_3804_2282/master/3804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97ac2005afc4dff88d2a6d3b6769b8e9","title":"weve got what weve got india series underlines australias batting issues","story":"No player was able to reach three figures and captain Tim Paine says a deep pool of batting talent is currently a ‘fantasy’ With the Australian captaincy, Tim Paine has already been handed one of the hardest jobs in the country – even in the cheeriest of times, it is seldom a picnic. So it is perfectly understandable that he doesn’t want to do as several of his predecessors have by signing himself up as a formal selector. Not now, at least. Not when the job of picking this team is one of the most scrutinised in the country.As substandard as some of the sectorial answers have been since the fateful day in Cape Town, the questions – in the short term at least – are increasingly puzzling. Paine knows this, realising that the best he can do right now is mine for positives, both in a couple of months, when he has at his disposal two of the best players in the world, and further into the future when trying to calculate the longer-term benefits of blooding batsmen before their time.“No,” he replied bluntly when asked if he would like to join the panel. “I’ve got enough on my plate at the moment. I’m happy when I’m asked my opinion and will give it. I’m happy with that,” he added, noting that he has never had an issue communicating with Trevor Hohns’ trio, emphasising the “difficult situation” they are also in through this disastrous period.The skipper acknowledged that “in an ideal world” younger players, such as Travis Head, would have required a lot more runs before getting to pop on a baggy green. “We can’t help that we haven’t got Michael Husseys, Michael Bevans, Jamie Coxs – it’s fantasy,” he said. “We’ve got what we’ve got and our playing group are working as hard as we can.”It makes harrowing reading that over the last 12 months, as calculated by cricket writer Brydon Coverdale, no Australian averaged more than 32 in Tests with only one ton posted – Usman Khawaja’s epic in Dubai. It is the latter point that Paine emphasised before the Test, wanting to see three-figure scores. It didn’t happen, Marcus Harris top scoring with 79.“If you are batting top six in Test cricket you need to be scoring hundreds,” Paine lamented, noting that they were disappointed not to get the chance to bat a second time on the washed out final day in Sydney. “For some of the guys in their third, fourth Test maybe it’s hard to look and say ‘I haven’t scored any hundreds’ but Marcus (Harris) and Travis (Head) showed, and Marnus (Labuschagne) in the first innings, that they can score runs at Test cricket.”This was an example of Paine going out of his way to group Head with Harris when dishing out praise, a sign that Paine wants the South Australian retained for the Sri Lanka Tests despite a string of reckless dismissals since Christmas. “They are two examples of guys who might not have played any Test cricket at this stage,” he said. “They’ve got an opportunity through an unusual situation and I thought both those guys acquitted themselves really well.”On the other side of the ledger, Paine is also hinting that Shaun Marsh, despite averaging 18 over the last 12 months with only one half-century in this series, will have his support when the squad for two Tests against Sri Lanka is named on Wednesday. “I don’t think it was just those two,” he said of questions of Marsh and Khawaja’s output against India as the team’s senior batsmen. “Both of those players we know are absolute class, we know they can score a lot of runs. We have faith in them going forward.”As for the fast bowlers, who experienced their share of days in the dirt in Melbourne and Sydney, Paine doesn’t anticipate change or rotation. “At times they bowled really well in this series and at times they didn’t,” he acknowledged. “Sometimes that was due to the pressure they were put under by the Indian batsmen. The group of bowlers we have in this team have been fantastic for quite a while now. They didn’t have their absolute best series but it’s not easy at this level and that can happen.”A 2-1 series defeat has been tough for the host nation but just as India’s sides of the 1990s credited much of their hardening up through punishing tours of Australia, Paine wants this hurt to have a similar steeling effect. But on the available evidence, that’s too far away to even start to consider. This might not even be the end of the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/285bfaaa1a682d823b0b682b542b179b205d1785/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6de67c5049352afaf104ddf5a966e918","title":"rugby union talking points from the premierships weekend action","story":"Cipriani’s bargaining position gets stronger, Vunipola shakes off the rust and the Dominator makes his England caseBristol’s head coach, Pat Lam, has asked Twickenham to scrutinise the law governing the lineout, arguing that Exeter are regularly awarded tries that should be penalties to their opponents. The Chiefs won the West Country derby with two tries that followed lineouts. Lam’s gripe with the first one was that the throw was not straight but his main complaint was with the second which turned into a driving maul. Lam wants the governing body to enforce the lineout regulation which states that players who do not participate in a lineout have to remain behind the offside line until play crosses the 15-metre line (from touch), pointing out backs who join a maul before that point has been reached are offside. HQ can expect another call. Paul ReesAs Johan Ackermann pointed out after Gloucester’s defeat by Leicester, it can be too simplistic to blame a loss on the absence of iniduals, all the more so when they have a profile like Danny Cipriani’s. But there can be little doubting he has been missed since he went down with a chest injury last month. Gloucester lost the match he was injured in, squeezed past Newcastle but have since lost to Sale and Leicester. On Saturday they performed far better than against the Sharks but Cipriani’s direction was still sorely missed and how Gloucester have underperformed in his absence should prove a powerful bargaining tool as he engages in talks over a new contract. Gloucester cannot get him back on the pitch soon enough. Gerard MeagherGood news for Saracens and for Eddie Jones: Billy Vunipola is back, not yet fully match fit after almost three months out with another broken limb, but causing havoc again. The England No 8 scored a superb opening try and played the full 80 minutes of Friday’s 24-18 defeat at Sale. It was his first appearance since fracturing his left forearm against Glasgow in October and put him in line for England’s Six Nations opener in Ireland on 2 February. Vunipola has started only three of England’s past 23 Tests due to a catalogue of injuries but an international return now seems inevitable. His teammate Richard Wigglesworth summed it up afterwards: “Billy deserves a bit of luck in the next few weeks.” Amen to that.

He scored his sixth try of the season against Saracens on Friday, and what a finish it was. Faf de Klerk fed Sam James whose inside pass found Solomona, who dropped the shoulder to leave Saracens’ defenders in his wake.Blake to make Tigers returnGeordan Murphy all but confirmed the return to the Leicester coaching staff of Phil Blake over the weekend. The former rugby league player initially joined the club as defence coach in 2014 but left the club a year later following a six-month suspension for breaching the Rugby\u0026nbspFootball Union’s betting rules.\u0026nbspHe has also worked as a defence coach for Wasps since leaving Welford Road but he was spotted at Saturday’s victory over Gloucester in a Leicester tracksuit. “Now Phil’s come around and we’re\u0026nbspjust sorting\u0026nbspout the final nuts and bolts,” said Murphy.Owens impresses at No 8A doff of the cap to Ken Owens, the Scarlets captain and hooker who lined up in the unfamiliar position of No 8 against the Dragons, such is the length of their injury list. Owens impressed and earned rave reviews from the Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac after his side’s 22-13 victory: “We didn’t have anyone one else. I thought he handled it pretty well.”Mike Brown made a record-breaking 308th appearance for Harlequins at Newcastle on Saturday, eclipsing the previous record set by Grahame Murray in 1973. A thumping win was the perfect way to celebrate the landmark and, while Brown was his usual effervescent self, centre stage went to blindside flanker Alex Dombrandt. The 21-year-old from Croydon, dubbed “The Dominator”, was all things to Paul Gustard’s men: winning tackles at the breakdown, supporting the attack, cajoling his teammates. Inspiring. Dombrandt is being talked up as an England candidate and it would be no surprise to see him make Eddie Jones’ squad for the forthcoming Six Nations. Ross HeppenstallThe temptation to bend the rules must have been intense, but each time Bath lost a prop to the sinbin they dutifully sent on another for a scrummaging contest they knew they could not win. Contrast with the 2017 shenanigans of France and Wales at the end of the only other finish to compare in recent years. Todd Blackadder has had his problems but when he looks you in the eye to say such gamesmanship never occurred to him you know you are talking to a man of integrity. We think it is the first time a squad has finished with more players off the pitch than on. Michael AylwinNorthampton have endured a topsy-turvy seasonal period and uncertainty also still surrounds the fitness of England’s co-captain Dylan Hartley. Chris Boyd, Saints’ director of rugby, has strongly hinted his hooker will not feature for Northampton again prior to the Six Nations. So will Hartley be fit to face Ireland in Dublin? “I would have thought so but grumbly knees can keep grumbling,” replied Boyd. How would he define “grumbly”? “It’s not ligament, it might just be wear and tear. I do know he’s been working incredibly hard and doing two or three fitness sessions a day. Apart from the grumbly knee he’s actually in pretty good nick.” Wasps’ director of rugby, Dai Young, meanwhile, believes his son Thomas still has a decent Test career ahead of him. “He’s an international rugby player not playing international rugby,” said Young Sr. “Mind you, he knows he’s got to play well otherwise he can’t come round to the house and see his mother.” Robert Kitson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b38a4e6150215b51a405a18b063559943bc2f71/0_82_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a051baa4adb64e1d46d0d345a948679a","title":"time is love tiempo es amor review finborough london","story":"Finborough, LondonChé Walker’s enigmatic drama, set in Los Angeles, is the theatrical equivalent of film noirWritten and directed by Ché Walker, this play brings a touch of unexpected glamour to a tiny Earl’s Court theatre. It is set in Los Angeles where it was originally performed, stars Girl from the North Country’s Sheila Atim – who also composed the atmospheric score – and makes extensive use of video and dance. Yet, for all its high production values, I found it as puzzlingly enigmatic as its bilingual title suggests.The plot is as convoluted as The Big Sleep, and there are times when Walker’s dialogue seems to be paying direct homage to Chandler: at one point Atim as a sophisticated lapdancer called Rosa laconically tells a cop: “You know your way round a woman and you have good hygiene.” The essential story, however, is one of betrayal. Blaz, a petty hood in the barrio, takes the rap for a hold-up when his partner-in-crime, Karl, flees the scene.While Blaz is doing three years in jail, his lover, Havana, has a fling with the detective who has put him behind bars. On emerging from the slammer, Blaz instinctively seeks revenge on those who have done him wrong.Walker has been quoted as saying he was inspired by the idea of “what if Desdemona was actually cheating” and the echoes of Othello are loud and insistent. Karl becomes an Iago-like plotter besotted by Blaz and informing him, “I know you longer than your woman know you.” Atim, who played Emilia last year in Othello at Shakespeare’s Globe, here fulfils a faintly similar role in that she acts as Havana’s counsellor when she is accused of infidelity. In addition to Shakespeare, the piece is also studded with references to films and plays ranging from Nosferatu to Mrs Warren’s Profession.But I found myself constantly wondering what Walker was driving at. Is he suggesting, like Bacon, that there is a “wild justice” in revenge, that love is inseparable from treachery or that Los Angeles is the last refuge of the lonely? All those ideas surface but none of them is strong enough to hold the story together.What we get is the theatrical equivalent of film noir. Atim’s music has a nerve-jangling quality. The sex, especially between Havana and the cop, is upfront and is represented both by cinematic coupling and choreographed movement. The threat of violence is also ever-present. The cast, most of whom switch between English and Spanish, perform with great precision. Atim is always hypnotic as a denizen of smoky nightclubs searching for romantic love. Gabriel Akuwudike invests Blaz with a baffled menace, Jessica Ledon hints that Havana, however unfaithful, is good at heart, and Benjamin Cawley leaves us in no doubt that the conniving Karl is in love with Blaz whom he incites to violence.The strangest role, however, is that of a sex worker named Serena who acts as a chorus. Played with dash and spirit by Sasha Frost, she is given to recurring dreams about pterodactyls flying over Los Angeles, which seems a rather desperate attempt by Walker to lend mystery to a city that was once said to have “the personality of a paper cup”. Like much else in Walker’s baroque play, it doesn’t really add up, yet I found myself succumbing to the filmic verve of his production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e52fb7454f217de6cb8f78ec5885bb8692b6e8/0_69_2071_1243/master/2071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e259990db7ea7c4dc19ebf87fa8d328","title":"tell us about a great retreat experience for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Whether it was yoga or mindfulness, painting or running, we’d love to hear about retreats worldwide that have soothed, inspired or made you thinkMaybe you rebooted your mind with a meditation holiday, kickstarted an exercise campaign or spent a week immersed in learning a new skill.

Wake up your neighbours … rise up as one and take control of the street,” he added, calling on Gabonese to occupy the country’s airports, public buildings and media organisations.A witness told Reuters a crowd of about 300 people had gathered in support of the attempted coup at the state broadcasting headquarters, where the military fired teargas to disperse them.The Bongo family has ruled Gabon since 1967, except for four months in 2009 after Ali Bongo’s father, Omar, died.Four of the five plotters were taken into custody on Monday morning, Mapangou told France 24. The fifth was caught in the afternoon. “The government is in place. The institutions are in place,” Mapangou said. The communications minister said the men were “a group of jokers and the military hierarchy does not recognise them”.Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chair of the African Union, said he strongly condemned the coup attempt. A spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry also criticised the action in its former colony. “Gabon’s stability can only be ensured in strict compliance with the provisions of its constitution,” she said.Bongo became ill in October while on a visit to Saudi Arabia. Rather than going home, he went to recuperate in Morocco, from where he gave a New Year’s Day statement in which he admitted he had been “through a difficult period, as sometimes happens in life”. He said he was preparing to return home soon.Obiang said Bongo’s speech, in which he slurred some words and appeared unable to move his right arm, had “reinforced doubts about the president’s ability to continue to carry out the responsibilities of his office”.Omar Bongo squandered much of Gabon’s vast oil wealth and kept close ties with France in a system known as Françafrique.

I want to win a title while I’m at junior high school.”Go, which requires players to take control of territory on the board, is said to have originated in China more than 2,500 years ago and has an estimated 20 million active players, mainly in east Asia.Fans of go will be hoping that Nakamura’s extraordinary rise will boost interest the game, in the same way Sota Fujii did for shogi, a Japanese version of chess.Fujii set a record for consecutive victories in professional shogi in 2017, aged just 14, winning plaudits from the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and sparking a surge of interest in the game.Last month, Fujii won his 100th official match, becoming the youngest professional player to reach the milestone. He also completed the feat faster than any other player."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca9e37a9ff26b12204a8d38cefe8ebc471571261/0_0_2117_1270/master/2117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b51254c028311943e787816df477903f","title":"kevin spacey nantucket ","story":"Actor due in courtroom to be arraigned on felony charges for an alleged sexual assault against a busboy at a restaurant in 2016The tiny, fish-hook shaped island of Nantucket feels like a place separated from America by place and time. There are no traffic lights. You won’t find a McDonalds, CVS or any other chain store ubiquitous across the US. In its quiet and partially cobblestoned downtown, some leave their cars running while they go into shops. In winter, the silence is only broken by church bells and the sound of a foghorn.In the 1800s the island was the centre of the whaling industry but it has left its gritty past behind. It now attracts the richest of the rich, among them scions of business, owners of sports teams and faces familiar from TV: former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Tommy Hilfiger, Chris Matthews, John Kerry, Charles Schwab and Ben Stiller come here, among many others. Among those who have everything and can go anywhere, many choose to live – or at least summer – here.The actor Kevin Spacey visited the island in recent years. On Monday, he is due in the island’s lone courtroom to be arraigned on felony charges for an alleged sexual assault against a busboy at a restaurant in 2016. If convicted, the actor could face five years in prison. He would also have to register as a sex offender.The saga has brought the #MeToo movement, and all the attention it generates, to an island where many go to get out of the spotlight.“Extremely wealthy people or famous people or high-level politicians are attracted to Nantucket for a variety of reasons,” said Bruce Percelay, publisher of Nantucket Magazine and the chairman and founder of the Mount Vernon Company, a New England real estate firm. “But one of them is that people don’t care. If a celebrity comes to Nantucket and is hoping to be fawned over, they will be very disappointed. This is not the kind of place where people go to genuflect over sightings of the rich and famous. We leave that kind of behaviour to the Hamptons.”There appears to be truth to this. On Friday evening Bill Belichick – coach of the New England Patriots football team, practically a deity to many in Massachusetts, particularly at playoff time – was having a quiet dinner in the corner of a dimly lit restaurant where this writer was enjoying a beer. Nobody appeared to be paying him much attention, save for perhaps this writer, who couldn’t help but steal glances at the man with five Super Bowl rings.“Enjoy your evening coach,” a hostess said casually as Belichick walked out into the cold winter night. “Good luck next Sunday!”“You could be sitting on a bench on Main Street next to a billionaire and you wouldn’t know it because everybody is just casual and in their happy place,” said Jeneane Life, owner of the Carlisle Inn. “Nantucket just gets in your blood. It’s just a peaceful, serene, beautiful place.”On Nantucket, Percelay said, the rich and famous “can be themselves. That is something increasingly difficult to find.“You can pick up the phone book and find the names of Fortune 100 CEOs and their home phone numbers.”For those who want to make a home here, the entry barrier is set forbiddingly high. According to the Inquirer and Mirror, the island’s weekly newspaper, the median home price on the island last year was $1.8m. The average price sat at $2.7m.“We like to jokingly say that this is where the millionaires have to mow the lawns for the billionaires,” said Renee Ceely, executive director of the Nantucket Housing Authority. “Because if you do own real estate, more than likely it’s worth more than a million dollars.”Even visiting the island is out of reach for many: during the summer, rooms at inns run to many hundreds of dollars a night. There is one hostel, but visitors won’t find any motels or popular chain hotels.The exclusivity of Nantucket is enhanced by its seclusion, 30 miles off the Massachusetts coast. The only way on or off is by ferry or plane, though both of those options can be delayed by poor weather.The island has about 10,000 year-round residents, but that number can go up more than five-fold in the summer. With most of the island zoned as conservation land and unavailable for development, land and housing stocks are limited. That means that finding housing for the workers who make the island tick – school teachers, postal workers, cops, restaurant and hotel staff – presents significant challenges.“Affordable housing affects everyone, even the wealthy,” Ceely said. “They get their meals, who takes care of them behind the register at the supermarket, who’s cleaning the floors at the hospital? Who’s your nurse?”On such an island, where invisibility and seclusion are main draws, the attention brought by the Spacey case is unwelcome, a breach of presumed safety and serenity.Spacey was an outsider, just visiting, when the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred. His accuser, however, is from a family with Nantucket ties. He is the son of Heather Unruh, a former Boston news anchor and a fixture on the island. In October 2017, as the #MeToo movement was born with sexual abuse allegations surfacing against film producer Harvey Weinstein, Unruh used Twitter.“The #weinsteinscandal has emboldened me – #truth time,” she wrote. “I was a Kevin Spacey fan until he assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell.”Days later, actor Anthony Rapp came forward with allegations against Spacey, saying that when he was a 14-year-old child actor in New York, a 26-year-old Spacey tried to force himself on him. Spacey said he did not remember the alleged incident, but apologised for “deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour”.In November that year, Unruh held a press conference where she said her then 18-year-old son had been star-struck when Spacey showed up at the Club Car restaurant, where he worked. She alleged the actor bought her son alcohol and later stuck his hands in his pants, grabbing his genitals. She said her son fled the restaurant when Spacey excused himself to go to the bathroom.Spacey will plead not guilty. But to Percelay the alleged incident was a violation of what Nantucket is about.“This type of celebrity just doesn’t fit the ethos of Nantucket.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/204598045c9b51d4ad182917e94ba015e41af67f/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2d966cf534e6afe388c77017240e5ce","title":"saudi woman fleeing family wont be deported say thai officials","story":"Reprieve for Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, who wants to claim asylum in AustraliaAn 18-year-old Saudi woman seeking passage to asylum in Australia after fleeing her family in Saudi Arabia and renouncing Islam will be temporarily admitted to Thailand, Thai authorities have said.Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun barricaded herself inside a transit zone hotel room in Bangkok airport to prevent immigration officials putting her on a flight to Kuwait after she was denied entry to Thailand while en route to Australia.Qunun said she would be killed if she was returned to Saudi Arabia, and vowed not to leave the hotel until she could see representatives from the United Nations high commissioner for refugees.Surachate Hakparn, Thailand’s immigration police chief, told reporters on Monday evening that Qunun would be granted entry under the protection of the office of the UNHCR, which says it has been in touch with her.He also said Qunun’s father was due to arrive in Bangkok on Monday night and that officials would establish whether or not she wanted to return to the Middle East with him.Qunun, who has a three-month tourist visa for Australia, said in a video posted on social media from inside the airport that she was trying to escape from her family because they subjected her to physical and psychological abuse. She has appealed for help from Europe, the US, Canada and Australia.After her case was picked up in international media, Samut Prakan, the head of Thailand’s immigration bureau, told reporters: “If deporting her would result in her death, we definitely wouldn’t want to do that.”A 20-year-old friend of Qunun, whom the  has chosen not to name and who recently moved from Saudi Arabia to Australia, said the threats to her were real. “She’s ex-Muslim and has a very strict family. They’re using violence with her and she faced sexual harassment,” she said. “She received a threat from her cousin – he said he wants to see her blood, he wants to kill her.”Qunun’s friend has lived in Australia for three months, and said she was seeking asylum there after being abused in Saudi Arabia. She said she had known Qunun for a year, after connecting with her online. “She’s an activist, she’s a feminist,” she said. Georg Schmidt, Germany’s ambassador to Thailand, tweeted his support for Qunun, saying: “We share the great concern for Rahaf Mohammed and are in touch with the Thai side and the embassies of the countries she approached.”Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch’s Asia deputy director, said there was no doubt Qunun needed refugee protection.“Rahaf faces grave harm if she is forced back to Saudi Arabia so she should be allowed to see UNHCR and apply for asylum, and Thailand should agree to follow whatever the UN refugee agency decides,” Robertson told the .“She’s desperately fearful of her family, including her father who is a senior government official, and given Saudi Arabia’s long track record of looking the other way in so-called honour violence incidents, her worry that she could be killed if returned cannot be discounted,” he said.Saudi culture and ship policy requires women to have permission from a male relative to work, travel, marry, and even get some medical treatment.Qunun, from Ha’il, in north-west Saudi Arabia, said she was stopped by Saudi and Kuwaiti officials when she arrived at Suvarnabhumi airport on Sunday and her travel document was forcibly taken from her, a claim backed by Human Rights Watch.Police officials and staff at the Bangkok airport hotel where Qunun was staying said late on Monday that she had already left her room there, though her exact destination was not made public.The Saudi embassy in Bangkok said Qunun was initially held for not having a return ticket, and that she still had her passport, a claim she denied."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77f2a7b71ea97b7819126c52573c729d81f657c3/0_118_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b44ec1a32e83c41c27a4174391e8a65f","title":"the mormon polygamists who believe missouri is the promised land","story":"The Ranch is a mystery to those in neighboring towns, but is considered Zion to the about 400 polygamists who live thereAfter church, Flint Laub, his two wives and their 10 children sat down at the kitchen table to eat pizza.The lunch was served in the big house, where Michelle Laub, 32, and her seven children live. Flint’s second wife is Ruth Anne Laub, who is 25 and Michelle’s half-sister. She recently gave birth to her third child. Ruth Anne Laub and her kids live in a second house a few steps away from the big one.The Laubs live in a polygamous community of perhaps 400 people in rural Missouri between the towns of Humansville and Stockton. The residents call it “The Ranch”, though the agriculture is limited to a hay field and a few cows and chickens. People in the neighboring towns refer to the community as “the compound”, but you won’t see any high walls or armed guards — just brown dirt roads winding through clusters of trees and homes.Inside the big house, the adults laughed about what outsiders think of them. Flint, 40, runs a roofing company. If someone asks him if he’s a polygamist, he’ll say yes. Sometimes people will ask if The Compound is really prepped for warfare, assuming they are survivalists (they’re not). Ruth Anne, who has worked as a first responder in Stockton, says one day someone asked her if she believed in air conditioning. Yes, she said. Her house is modern constructed from concrete poured into plastic foam.“It probably bothers me that people think that’s who we are,” Ruth Anne said, “but it’s funny, too.”“If I was raised outside the religion,” Flint said, “and heard about people with multiple wives, I would think that’s pretty crazy, too.”“I believe Missouri is the promised land,” said Sean Anderson, a 51-year-old fundamentalist Mormon from Mexico who has also lived in Arizona and Utah. He recently moved to The Ranch with his wife and their six children.The residents are a hodgepodge of people whose members in Utah haven’t always gotten along. But here, the polygamists worship not only with each other, but also with the Mormon church, also known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which officially abandoned polygamy in 1890 and excommunicates members found practicing it.Despite their differences, the mainstream Latter-day Saints and people on The Ranch still share core beliefs, and the community still uses its texts. This week, Seth Laub, an elder in the congregation, gave a lesson from the Book of Mormon. “Nothing is hopeless in God’s eyes,” Seth told worshippers.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was founded in 1830 by a then-24-year-old Vermont-born Joseph Smith. To this day, anyone considering themselves to be a Latter-day Saint still reveres Smith. Fundamentalist Mormons, the ones who are not part of the mainstream church, and often practice polygamy, believe in following his original teachings, including a revelation Smith said he received three times between 1834 and 1842: Smith told associates that an angel appeared to him and told him to practice plural marriage. Historians believe Smith married his first plural wife in Kirkland, Ohio, in the mid-1830s. Smith died in 1844.Today, some fundamentalist Mormon polygamists believe plural marriage is necessary to reach the highest level of heaven. Others practice polygamy simply to follow Smith’s teachings. These polygamists tend to believe in big families: women often give birth to 10 or more children. While some of the polygamist leaders have been known to have 20 or more wives, most men have two or three.The idea of The Ranch emerged on 7 November, 1983, when Stephen Laub was at his home in Motoqua, an enclave in south-west Utah for members of a polygamous church called the Apostolic United Brethren, or AUB.He was in the cellar, stocking and preparing it to ride out an apocalypse at the end of the millennium, when he heard someone call his name.He went to his wives to ask what they wanted. They said they didn’t call him and didn’t hear a voice.He heard the voice over eight days. Eventually, he tracked the voice to a nearby mountain. He started hiking. The voice had more instructions as he hiked farther up the mountain.As he recorded in his journal: “The Lord told me he wants me to go to Missouri and buy a farm.”For Mormons of all stripes, Missouri — specifically Jackson County — is a landmark. Mormons began arriving there in 1831 and that year, Smith had a prophecy that Zion was in Jackson County and that Jesus would return there one day.But Latter-day Saints had conflicts with other Missouri settlers over land, commerce and governance and by 1838, violence got so bad modern textbooks call it the Missouri Mormon War. The ugliest episode happened that year, when 17 Latter-day Saints and one sympathizer were massacred at a place called Haun’s Mill. Latter-day Saints soon began leaving the state.When Laub hiked down from the mountain and arrived home, his brother Derril Laub and another resident, Bruce Compton, were there to help him with the cellar. He told them they needed to go to Missouri. Because Latter-day Saints believe their movement started with a revelation from God, no one challenged him.They did ask where in Missouri they were supposed to go. To provide them with an answer, Stephen Laub hiked back up the mountain to seek a clarification. God told him to go about 100 miles south of Independence.The next day, the Laub brothers, some of their sons, Compton and another resident named Kent Andra loaded into a blue pickup truck and began driving east.“The idea was to build the kingdom of God, establish Zion,” Compton, now 76, said in a recent interview.The men stopped in St George, Utah to make a phone call. It was to the president of their church, Owen Allred, in Salt Lake City. Stephen conveyed his plan.Allred didn’t like it. After being driven from Missouri, the early leaders of the Latter-day Saints issued prophecies saying God’s wrath would be visited upon western Missouri. While some Mormons believe the burned towns and bloodshed western Missouri suffered during the American Civil War fulfilled the prophecy and wiped the slate clean, Allred was among those who thought Missouri still had it coming.He told Stephen to go look at Missouri, but not to buy anything.The truck stopped in Fort Scott, Kansas, just across the state line from Missouri. The men went into a real estate office, where one of the men saw a pamphlet advertising 600 acres between the Missouri towns of Stockton and Humansville.It was a wooded, undeveloped property on one of the Ozark mountains’ massive plateaus. The men drove to the 600 acres to inspect it. They had found their place.The men negotiated a purchase price of $300 an acre and paid $3,000 earnest money. They promised to make a down payment of $34,000 within 30 days. That was money the men didn’t have when they made the agreement. Other believers back in Utah chipped in, and the financing of the property has become part of its mythology — proof that God wanted the believers to be in southwest Missouri.The group contributions were also the first example of ranch residents practicing what’s called a United Order, a fundamentalist Mormon form of communal living where followers give money, entire pieces of property or time and talents to benefit the community.At a coffee shop in Stockton, Missouri, on a blustery November day, Anderson explained what he liked about living out at The Ranch.He’s a two-hour drive from Jackson county for the day Christ returns he also likes that he can have discussions of Mormon doctrine with other residents without fear of offending someone. “They may not agree with me,” Anderson said, “and they aren’t going to ostracize me.”That makes The Ranch a unique spot. Even though Mormon polygamists all trace their beliefs to the same place, they have had disagreements. The groups have tended to isolate themselves within specific neighborhoods in metropolitan Salt Lake City or locations in the Utah or Arizona deserts.While most of the disputes have been peaceful, the most infamous episodes happened in the 1970s when a polygamist named Ervil LeBaron ordered the murders of rival polygamous leaders and others who he thought offended God. One of the victims in 1977 was Rulon Allred, who founded the AUB. He was shot to death in his chiropractic clinic in Salt Lake City.Today some of LeBaron and Allred’s relations live among the polygamists near Humansville. The Ranch has residents who hail from at least three distinct polygamous sects, plus what are known as independents. Those are people with fundamentalist Mormon beliefs who do not affiliate with a church.Anderson would qualify as one of those. He was born in Mexico to a Mexican mother and American father. Anderson developed a belief in fundamental Mormonism. He had two wives for a time, but those marriages dissolved.He and his current wife, Clara Anderson, moved to The Ranch in the fall with their six children. Clara, 39, is one of Rulon Allred’s great-granddaughters.Within their household, the Andersons admit the roles are traditional. Sean works in construction and is a part owner of a barbecue restaurant while his wife stays home.“I stay home with my kids because I want to stay home with my kids,” she said. “It’s not because Sean told me to stay home.”Women from The Ranch are weary of the public perception of wives in polygamy as trapped inside a home. Some women hold jobs in the surrounding communities and some don’t.A review of marriage licenses in southwest Missouri shows most residents of the polygamous community marry in their 20s, though a few brides and grooms have been as young as 17. In Mormon polygamy, the husband usually has one legal wife subsequent marriages are ordained in a religious service, but there’s no license on file with any county clerk.In Missouri, you can be convicted of bigamy if a married person “purports,” to quote the statute, to marry another person. The offense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. That’s a lesser punishment than, say, Utah, where polygamy is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison or 15 years if it’s committed in conjunction with a fraud or violent offense.Cedar county prosecutor Ty Gaither, one of the locals who refer to the polygamous community as The Compound, said he has not received any complaints about crimes there. He points out his county is home to multiple religious communities, including Amish and Mennonite.“Let’s put it this way,” Gaither said of a plural marriage, “if I had three parties who were consenting adults, I wouldn’t have a complaining witness. If I had a complaining witness, we would take a look.”As they finished lunch, Flint, Michelle and Ruth Anne Laub talked more about some of the perceptions people have of their family.Over the years, some have asked if the community has a relationship to Warren Jeffs, the president of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who is serving a sentence of life plus 20 years in prison for crimes related to sexually abusing two girls he married as plural wives. (The answer is no there are no known Jeffs followers at The Ranch.)The spouses also discussed the changes they have seen in the community. The AUB leaders in Utah were never pleased with those who moved to Missouri and as a result, the two communities have had little relationship in the last 35 years.People have come and gone over the years. Compton, one of those Motoqua men who drove to Missouri in the blue pickup truck, didn’t find everything he was looking for on those 600 acres that was supposed to be Zion.Compton says living in a plural marriage and a united order gave him a lot of questions and not enough answers about God. Before he moved to Missouri, Compton came across a book about Jewish Kabbalah during a work trip to California.Kabbalah is meant to explain the relationship between God and the universe. Compton developed an interest in metaphysics. The other Motoqua men didn’t like it. They believed metaphysics conflicted with their fundamentalist Mormon beliefs. They eventually asked Compton to leave.Compton separated from his plural wives, remarried to just one woman, and now leads a church in nearby Buffalo, Missouri, where he preaches a belief in an almighty creator. He’ll teach from the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Torah, the Qur’an or any other text promoting monotheism.“I search for truth,” Compton said.You can also buy a psychic reading from Compton and his wife, Connie Compton. The client will share certain information that Bruce relays to Connie. Through a trance, she will give advice or tell the client the cause of any physical or emotional ailments.As for what’s next at what people call either The Compound or The Ranch, the residents years ago poured a concrete foundation for a temple against a small slope near the center of the community.No one seems to know when the rest of the temple will be constructed, or whether it will take the impetus of the residents or direction from God.• This piece was co-published with The Salt Lake Tribune."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3739267.1545409801!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"crappy new year 16 ways to survive skint january","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHundreds of millions of coppers worth tens of millions of euro, that have simply disappeared in Irish homes.

File photograph: Tom HonanPA Wire Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said British prime minister Theresa May’s acceptance that ensuring a seamless Irish Border post-Brexit needed to involve more than warm words was helpful. The Taoiseach made the comments on Sunday, the first day of his week-long trip to Africa, after an interview Mrs May gave on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.During the interview, the British prime minister stated that solid action was required to avoid a hard Border after the UK leaves the EU in March.Mr Varadkar described Mrs May’s comments as significant. “One thing the prime minister said today which I think is very valid, and I hope will be listened to, is avoiding a hard Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is not just the case of people saying they don’t want one,” said Mr Varadkar.“It is also necessary to give practical and legal effect to that. “That means agreeing the same customs rules and full regulatory alignment. That is what is required to avoid a hard Border. “We need more than good intent and warm words. We need a treaty that can give effect to the practical considerations.”Mrs May faces a crucial ballot this month in the House of Commons, when MPs vote on whether to accept the UK’s withdrawal agreement with the EU.Mr Varadkar on Sunday dismissed the idea of the Republic as having any role as a persuader in the debate preceding the vote. Mr Varadkar was speaking in Mali, where he met Irish troops who are currently serving with the EU training force in the country.

scrutinised","story":"British prime minister Theresa May says the UK will be in “uncharted territory” if MPs reject her Brexit deal. A vote on the deal is earmarked for the week starting January 14th. Video: BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr Show\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Theresa May on the BBC’s “The Andrew Marr Show”: said she would work to secure further assurances from EU leaders on the backstop to assuage members of her Conservative Party and the DUP. Photograph: Jeff OversBBCHandoutA formal exchange of letters between the EU and the UK, stipulating that the Northern Ireland backstop will be temporary and superseded by a comprehensive trade deal, is to be examined by officials as a way to break the Brexit impasse at Westminster.The moves, likely to be approved by the Government, come as British prime minister Theresa May steps up efforts to secure the backing of the House of Commons for the agreement reached with the EU on the UK’s withdrawal.Mrs May on Sunday insisted that the vote – postponed before Christmas – would go ahead next week, but the DUP, which props up her government, described the backstop as “the poison which makes any vote for the withdrawal agreement so toxic”.Mrs May was sticking firmly to her position that the backstop – a mechanism that aims to insure there is no hard Irish border should the UK not reach a deal – was a necessary part of the agreement. Her comments were welcomed by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who was speaking on the first day to a trip to Mali.“One thing the prime minister said today which I think is very valid and I hope will be listened to is that avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is not just the case of people saying they don’t want one,” he said. The Taoiseach said an agreement on “the same customs rules and full regulatory alignment” was required to avoid a hard border. “We need more than good intent and warm words. We need a treaty that can give effect to the practical considerations,” he said. Mrs May told the BBC she would work to secure further assurances from EU leaders on the backstop to assuage members of her Conservative Party and the DUP.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that, following engagement between his party and Downing Street, “the fundamental problems which make this a bad deal appear not to have changed”. Mrs May cautioned that between Tory MPs seeking “a perfect Brexit” and Labour MPs seeking a second referendum, “the danger there is we end up with no Brexit at all”.Mrs May’s allies were continuing efforts to turn around huge opposition to the backstop among her MPs, with reports suggesting a variety of mechanisms, including consulting the EU Court of Justice on its temporary nature.Irish and EU sources were clear that anything which affected the legal text of the withdrawal agreement would not be possible. The exchange of letters setting out each side’s understanding of the intended temporary nature of the backstop is said to be more realistic. Some sources expressed scepticism that it would be sufficient to win over the DUP and Tory Brexiteers. EU leaders are keen to offer Mrs May help in her efforts to pass the treaty at Westminster but are wary that any concessions or guarantees to the British would be “banked” and that Mrs May would return to Brussels seeking further movement, perhaps after losing next week’s vote.Irish and EU sources believe that, even if she loses next week’s vote, Mrs May will continue to seek approval for her deal, returning to the House of Commons at a later date. Mrs May repeatedly refused to rule out such a move on Sunday.Mr Varadkar dismissed the idea of Ireland having any role as a persuader in the debate preceding the crucial vote in the House of Commons next Monday. “Ultimately the vote and decision by the British parliament at Westminster is a decision for them. You have to weigh up on the one hand our desire to see it ratified with the possibility that that could backfire if we were trying to tell another parliament, another country, how they should vote.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Victoria JonesPA WireA large convoy of lorries has descended on a disused airfield as the British government carries out a major test of its plans for UK border disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Nearly 100 lorries arrived at Manston Airport near Ramsgate in Kent early on Monday morning to line up along the runway before driving along the A256 towards Dover.The trial, called Operation Brock, is testing out the site as a mass HGV holding bay to ease congestion on roads to Channel ports.Road signs were erected on Sunday night directing drivers to the test.Lorries from regional and national haulage companies — with Eddie Stobart leading the pack — started to arrive at the airfield from around 7am on Monday to form a queue along the runway.The drivers congregated in a large group before being directed by officials from the UK department for transport, Kent County Council and police officers.The first practice run began in rush-hour shortly after 8am, with four convoys leaving at intervals between 8.13am and 8.39am.The first of the convoys arrived in Dover at 8.52am.Up to 150 lorries were initially anticipated to take part. So far 89 have been involved, the department confirmed after the first test on Monday morning.The plans emerged last week after the department and council sent letters to hauliers explaining this was to “establish the safest optimum release rate of HGVs”.The 32km (20 mile) journey takes about half an hour depending on traffic.A second test was expected to take place at 11am.A department spokeswoman said: “We do not want or expect a no-deal scenario and continue to work hard to deliver a deal with the EU.“However, it is the duty of a responsible government to continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies, including a possible no deal.“We will be testing part of Operation Brock to ensure that, if it needs to be implemented, the system is fully functional.”Congestion at the Channel ports caused by the reintroduction of customs checks on goods has been one of the most commonly cited negative effects of a no-deal withdrawal from the EU at the end of March.Also known as Kent International Airport, the site closed in 2014 after owners were unable to find a buyer.–PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: AFPTwitter courtesy of  Rahaf Mohammed al-QununAn 18-year-old woman detained in Thailand after fleeing her family in Saudi Arabia and renouncing Islam will not be sent back to the Middle East against her wishes, Thai officials have said.Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun barricaded herself inside a transit zone hotel room in Bangkok airport to prevent immigration officials putting her on a flight to Kuwait. She was denied entry to Thailand while en route to Australia, where she has a three-month multiple-entry tourist visa and said she was intending to seek asylum.Ms Qunun says she would be killed if she was returned to Saudi Arabia and has vowed not to leave the hotel room until she can see representatives from the United Nations high commissioner for refugees.“I am Rahaf . . . I am in the hotel, I need a country to protect me as soon as possible. I am seeking asylum,” Ms Qunun said in a video posted on social media.Samut Prakan, the head of Thailand’s immigration bureau, said: “If deporting her would result in her death, we definitely wouldn’t want to do that.” Ms Qunun would speak to UNHCR representatives later on Monday, he added.Ms Qunun said she was trying to escape from her family because they subjected her to physical and psychological abuse. She has appealed for help from Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. She fled Kuwait while her family was visiting the Gulf country.“My family is strict and locked me in a room for six months just for cutting my hair,” she said, adding that she was certain she would be imprisoned if sent back. “I’m sure, 100 per cent, they will kill me as soon as I get out of the Saudi jail,” she said.A 20-year-old friend of Ms Qunun who did not wish to be named said the threats to her were real. “She’s ex-Muslim and has a very strict family. They’re using violence with her and she faced sexual harassment,” she said. “She received a threat from her cousin – he said he wants to see her blood, he wants to kill her.”Ms Qunun’s friend has lived in Australia for three months, and said she was seeking asylum there after being abused in Saudi Arabia. She said she had known Ms Qunun for a year, after connecting with her online. “She’s an activist, she’s a feminist,” she said.Georg Schmidt, Germany’s ambassador to Thailand, tweeted his support for Ms Qunun, saying: “We share the great concern for Rahaf Mohammed and are in touch with the Thai side and the embassies of the countries she approached.”Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch’s Asia deputy director, said there was no doubt Ms Qunun needed refugee protection and that the UNHCR had to be given immediate access to the hotel.“Rahaf faces grave harm if she is forced back to Saudi Arabia so she should be allowed to see UNHCR and apply for asylum, and Thailand should agree to follow whatever the UN refugee agency decides,” Mr Robertson said.“She’s desperately fearful of her family, including her father who is a senior government official, and given Saudi Arabia’s long track record of looking the other way in so-called honour violence incidents, her worry that she could be killed if returned cannot be discounted,” he said.Saudi culture and ship policy requires women to have permission from a male relative to work, travel, marry, and even get some medical treatment.Ms Qunun, from Ha’il, in northwest Saudi Arabia, said she was stopped by Saudi and Kuwaiti officials when she arrived at Suvarnabhumi airport on Sunday and her travel document was forcibly taken from her, a claim backed by Human Rights Watch.The Saudi embassy in Bangkok said Ms Qunun was being held for not having a return ticket, and that she still had her passport, a claim denied by Ms Qunun. – "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

guidance for parents.The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said there was no safe amount of total daily screen time, but urged parents to show “tough love” in setting age-appropriate limits.In particular, the advice says parents should take firm action if time on smartphones and videogames is “displacing” other activities - such as sleep, exercise and face-to-face socialising.And its experts urged parents to “practise what they preach” - and spend less time of their leisure time glued to tablets and phones.The guidance comes alongside a systematic review of the scientific evidence regarding the health impact of screen time, published on Friday in BMJ Open.It found moderately strong evidence for a link between greater screen time and depressive symptoms.Researchers said it appeared that the “displacement of positive activities” - in particular, lost sleep, as a result of time spent scrolling - was the most convincing explanation for the link.And they said the impact of blue light on screens on the ability to sleep was likely to be a factor.Dr Max Davie, from the RCPCH, said stopping access to all screens for at least an hour before sleep was a  “sensible rule of thumb”.“The process of going to sleep is a physiological process involving the secretion of melatonin and screens appear to interfere with that,” he said.Researchers said the review also found links between high levels of screen time and excess weight - perhaps because children were likely to consume more snacks while staring at a screen.The college also urged parents to negotiate “age appropriate” boundaries on screen time with children, with firm consequences if such limits were breached.Dr Davie said families needed to ensure that screen time was “under control” - for adults as well as children.“Children do learn from example rather than instruction. It\u0027s difficult to impose strict limits on your children\u0027s screen use if you are constantly on screens yourself. It\u0027s much better to be authoritative about screens if you practise what you preach,” he said.“We suggest that age appropriate boundaries are established, negotiated by parent and child that everyone in the family understands. When these boundaries are not respected, actions need to be put in place with parents making consequences clear.”Four ways to keep your child safe onlineProf Russell Viner, the college’s president, said: “If you are authoritative - tough love and giving clear boundaries and warmth, that works.”The chief medical officer is currently considering setting new recommendations on screen time for children. But the college shied away from recommending a daily screen time limit for all children, saying more research was needed, particularly on the use of social media.So far, many studies on screen time have focussed on television habits, failing to keep up pace with the advent of websites and smart phones.Next week the head of the NHS is expected to unveil plans to expand children\u0027s mental health services to deal with the fallout from an explosion of social media.Simon Stevens has said the NHS has been left “picking up the pieces” of an epidemic of mental illness fuelled by digital overload.It comes after The  launched a duty of care campaign calling for more stringent regulation of sites like Facebook and Instagram, in order to protect children from harm.The expansion of mental health services for children - and the rollout of a four week target for treatment - are expected to form part of a 10-year plan for the NHS.Ski resort evacuated and thousands stranded as heavy snow

yesterday condemned “irrational” claims made at the 106th annual meeting of the prestigious Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA).The Breakthrough Science Society (BSS), an NGO that campaigns for scientific literacy, held protest meetings across the country against presentations suggesting that ancient Hindu epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata contain detailed knowledge of stem cell research, test tube babies, aircraft and guided missiles.People must ask the organisers how they allow this, said Rajani KS of BSS.Professor Nageswara Rao, vice chancellor of Andhra University, told the ISCA\u0027s special Children’s Science Congress that according to the Mahabharata, a single mother gave birth to 100 sons via test tube technology.“The Mahabharata says 100 eggs were fertilised and put into 100 earthen pots” Prof Rao said.He put it to an audience of teenagers that these were early test tube babies, claiming this proved stem cell research was prevalent in India thousands of years ago.Prof Rao also claimed that the Hindu god Ram used guided missiles that would chase targets, strike them and then return.The demon god Ravana, the professor further stated, operated 24 different types of aircraft from several airports in his kingdom.   Another participant, scientists Kannan Krishnan from Tamil Nadu in southern India, challenged Einstein’s theory of relativity and Isaac Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation on the grounds that neither of the two scientists understood physics.Mr Krishnan declared that the Theory of Gravitational Waves would soon be re-named “Modi Waves’, after the Indian prime Minister Narendra Modi.ISCA organisers, however, later distanced themselves from these two speakers and resolved to exercise more caution in inviting participants next year.“We are shocked at the comments made by the two speakers,” ISCA general secretary P P Mathur said.This is not the first time absurd claims have been made at ISCA meets, with critics alleging the Modi government has debased the organisation.In 2015 a paper on Indian aviation technology claimed that the ancient native sage Bhardwaja had detailed blueprints for varied types of aircraft.The year before prime minister Modi buttressed similar logic when he told an audience of doctors and scientists in Mumbai that plastic surgery and genetic science had flourished in ancient India.He said that was how the revered Hindu god Ganesha’s elephant head was attached to a human body, and how the warrior god Karna was born outside his mother’s womb.In a similar vein other members of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, in a bid to laud India’s achievements, have claimed that motorcars, space vehicles even the Internet existed in ancient times.Ski resort evacuated and

boar cull described polish hunters sick","story":"There are thought to be some 230,000 wild boar in PolandPlans by the Polish government for a massive cull of wild boar that would wipe out the vast majority of the population have been described by a hunting association as the brainchild of someone sick in the head.Under the plans - designed to combat African swine fever, a disease that has a high mortality rate in domesticated pigs - up to 210,000 boar could be shot in the next couple of months, according to the Polish Hunting Association.Although estimates vary, the current Polish boar population is thought to stand at around 230,000. To encourage hunters to shoot, the state is offering a bounty of up to £135 for an adult female.But the plan has been met with opposition from scientists and hunters. In an open letter the member of one hunting association condemned the plan saying it contravened the hunters’ code of ethics that places restrictions on which animals can be shot, and calls for hunters to protect native wildlife.“Someone who is sick in the head has decided that all boars should be shot, including pregnant sows and those that already have young,” wrote Marek Porczak, from a hunting association in the south of Poland, in the letter.“I appeal to all my colleagues not to take part in this massacre,” he added. “We have to convince our fellow hunters that to take part in this massacre would not only be unworthy of a hunter but also of a man.”The Polish environment ministry has justified the cull with the need to protect the Polish pig industry from the devastating effects of African swine fever.Highly contagious, it causes haemorrhaging in pigs and has no known cure, although it poses no threat to humans. In August 140,000 animals in Romania were slaughtered after an outbreak at one of the country’s biggest pig farms.But the government’s stance has been challenged by scientists. Professor Henryk Okarma and Doctor Katarzyna Bojarska, experts in nature conservation from the Polish Academy of Science, wrote in report published last year that no scientific study has shown a correlation between boar concentrations and the spread of African swine fever. Please review our commenting policyAustralian politician insists Nazi salutes do not prove rally he attended was racistSlim down or be grounded, Pakistan airline tells overweight cabin crewChurch of England orders remains of  alleged paedophile to be exhumed as family members don\u0026#39t want to be buried alongside himBrexit bargaining: What might the EU be able to offer Theresa May before next week’s meaningful vote?When is the Brexit \u0026#39meaningful vote\u0026#39 in Parliament, and what will happen if Theresa May\u0026#39s deal is rejected?House of Commons writes off £17,000 in unpaid food and drink bills for MPs and peers Surrey train stabbing: Suspect Darren Pencille refuses to enter plea, claiming he is \u0026#39paranoid\u0026#39Comment: As a former UK negotiator, here\u0026#39s how we could improve Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit dealIndian scientists condemn \u0026#39irrational\u0026#39 claims that Hindu epics contain stem-cell researchPope vows justice for child victims of sex abuse in annual addressNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe \u0026#39denied weekly phone calls to husband\u0026#39 after hunger strike threatIdris Elba hints again at potential James Bond role in Daniel Craig selfie at Golden Globes Comment: Let\u0026#39s not be frightened into staying on the wrong path, tied into an out-of-control EUTheresa May seeking 2021 time limit to Brexit backstop ahead of meaningful vote, minister suggestsFour hour A\u0026ampE waiting time target should be scrapped, indicates NHS bossSurrey train stabbing: Darren Pencille charged with murder after father killed in front of sonSuspect who snatched 17-month-old girl may have given her extra clothes before dumping her, police sayUS Navy sails through South China Sea as bilateral trade talks kick offGabon soldiers arrested after announcing coup \u0026#39to restore democracy\u0026#39 as president languishesComment: My own secret method for decluttering?

When adjusted for inflation, credit card debt is fractionally below a peak reached in Early\u0026nbsp2010 as the country emerged from one of the deepest recessions in its history.People with low incomes or living in poverty were turning to credit cards because of their heavy marketing and easy availability, according to David Steele of The Money Charity.Credit card lending continues to rise as interest rate hike loomsWhen personal loans are added in, each UK household has almost £8,000 of outstanding consumer credit.The Money Advice Service (MAS) estimates that 8.3 million people in the UK are over-indebted, and that 22 per cent of UK adults have less than £100 in savings, making them highly vulnerable to a financial shock such as losing their job or incurring unexpected bills.The precarious position of so many household could pose a wider threat, according to the BoE which warned more than a year ago that banks were in danger of underestimating the risks they face from being too lax in lending to consumers.\u0026nbspIf the economy were to enter a new downturn, lenders could incur £30bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance, the BoE said in July 2017.But consumer credit, which includes credit cards, store cards, car finance and other loans grew 7.1 per cent in the year to the end of November to £215.4bn.Despite ongoing fears about the future of the economy as the UK prepares to leave the EU Britons have increased their total amount of credit card debt in every month since July 2013 as wages have lagged behind the rising cost of living.Earnings growth picked up to the highest level for a decade in the final quarter of 2018 but this has done little to make up for 10\u0026nbspyears of wage stagnation that has left average inflation-adjusted earnings still languishing below their pre-crisis levels.Sue Anderson of StepChange, which provides free advice for those facing debt problems, said credit cards are the single most common issue the charity encounters.\u0026nbsp“More than two thirds of people we helped in the first six months of last year had credit card debt, with an average of around £7,600 on their outstanding borrowing on cards,” Ms Anderson said.\u0026nbspConsumer credit growth slows in DecemberConsumer credit growth hits new 11-year highMore than a third of single mothers in debt, research findsOil-hungry companies are contributing to huge debt problems in Africa“Credit cards can be useful and convenient, and when used as originally intended for short-term purposes, can be a helpful way of timing payments.\u0026nbsp“But if borrowing builds up without being paid back on a monthly basis, it can become expensive and increasingly difficult to pay off – which is why the regulator is now requiring firms to take steps to help their customers address persistent credit card debt. If you are struggling to manage, seek free advice from a reputable debt charity.”The figures highlight a ide in the UK between those able to borrow at close to record-low rates against the value of their homes and others pressured into taking out high-cost credit in order to make ends meet.While interest rates have remained close to historic lows as the economy continues to grow slowly, the average APR on credit card lending bearing interest was 18.5 per cent in October 2018, higher than the 15 per cent seen in 2006 before the financial crisis.What to do if you want to reduce your credit card debt“Don’t panic,” says David Steele of The Money Charity. “Don’t get pressured into doing something before you have had time to take advice. There are usually managed ways out.”Contact\u0026nbspStepChange\u0026nbspon 0800 138 1111.

Transferring a debt from a card with a high rate of interest to one with low or 0 per cent interest could help you pay off the debt faster.Make an assessment of all of your borrowing across cards, loans, overdrafts etc. Make sure you are paying off those with the highest interest rates and charges firstWhen charges are taken into account, overdrafts can sometimes be more expensiveHowever, remember that credit cards should not take priority over debts such as Council Tax, rent or utilities, where the consequences of not paying may be worseA January 2018 report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that one in four of the UK’s poorest households are in arrears with debts or are spending a quarter of their income or more on debt repayments.Borrowers could face a further squeeze with the BoE\u0026nbspexpected to raise its benchmark interest rate further this year, a move that will probably be passed on to consumers.However, millions of consumers do not pay any interest on their credit card debt, either because they clear their balance each month or because they have secured a 0 per cent deal. Just under 45 per cent of credit card balances pay no interest, according to UK Finance, an industry trade body.Those paying high interest rates may be able to transfer their balance to a cheaper card or consolidate their debts into one loan with a lower rate.The average APR for a £5,000 personal loan in October 2018 was 7.7 per cent while for a £10,000 loan it was 3.8 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

If you were a bored teenager in the late 20th century, there was always Woolworths to loiter in.An American import, Woolworths first arrived in the UK in Edwardian Liverpool. The inaugural “penny and sixpence store” opened its doors on 5 November 1909 with a ceremony featuring a live orchestra, circus performers and fireworks.Pennsylvanian entrepreneur Frank Winfield Woolworth soon had 40 British branches up and running, proving his doubters within the US head office wrong. They initially feared venturing across the Atlantic might lead them into a commercial “bear’s den”.By 1930, the 400th branch of Woolworth was opened in Southport, Lancashire. By the time the brand’s popularity peaked in the 1960s, the company had 1,141 branches around the country.\u0026nbspKirkby New Town, Lancashire, in 1967 (George W HalesFox PhotosGetty)Woolworths began to run into trouble in the 1980s and responded by pulling out of the Irish market and abandoning its out-of-town hypermarket format stores as a failure. It also vacated its big city centre department store premises like Briggate in Leeds in favour of open single-storey shops.At the turn of the millennium, the company tried various means to stay afloat, attempting to rival Argos with a “Big Red Book” ordering scheme and hiring oddly matched celebrities like Jackie Chan and Kelly Osbourne for their advertising campaigns.\u0026nbspBy late 2008, administrators Deloitte had been called in and all remaining 807 stores were gradually closed, resulting in 27,000 job losses. Investor Theo Paphitis was among those interested in saving the day before abandoning the project as a lost cause.The last of the company\u0027s stock was being sold off at bargain prices.Asked about the closure, Brixton shopper Lucy Ferguson hit the nail on the head when she said: “The problem was, you never really knew what Woolworths sold.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When adjusted for inflation, credit card debt is fractionally below a peak reached in Early\u0026nbsp2010 as the country emerged from one of the deepest recessions in its history.People with low incomes or living in poverty were turning to credit cards because of their heavy marketing and easy availability, according to David Steele of The Money Charity.Credit card lending continues to rise as interest rate hike loomsWhen personal loans are added in, each UK household has almost £8,000 of outstanding consumer credit.The Money Advice Service (MAS) estimates that 8.3 million people in the UK are over-indebted, and that 22 per cent of UK adults have less than £100 in savings, making them highly vulnerable to a financial shock such as losing their job or incurring unexpected bills.The precarious position of so many household could pose a wider threat, according to the BoE which warned more than a year ago that banks were in danger of underestimating the risks they face from being too lax in lending to consumers.\u0026nbspIf the economy were to enter a new downturn, lenders could incur £30bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance, the BoE said in July 2017.But consumer credit, which includes credit cards, store cards, car finance and other loans grew 7.1 per cent in the year to the end of November to £215.4bn.Despite ongoing fears about the future of the economy as the UK prepares to leave the EU Britons have increased their total amount of credit card debt in every month since July 2013 as wages have lagged behind the rising cost of living.Earnings growth picked up to the highest level for a decade in the final quarter of 2018 but this has done little to make up for 10\u0026nbspyears of wage stagnation that has left average inflation-adjusted earnings still languishing below their pre-crisis levels.Sue Anderson of StepChange, which provides free advice for those facing debt problems, said credit cards are the single most common issue the charity encounters.\u0026nbsp“More than two thirds of people we helped in the first six months of last year had credit card debt, with an average of around £7,600 on their outstanding borrowing on cards,” Ms Anderson said.\u0026nbspConsumer credit growth slows in DecemberConsumer credit growth hits new 11-year highMore than a third of single mothers in debt, research findsOil-hungry companies are contributing to huge debt problems in Africa“Credit cards can be useful and convenient, and when used as originally intended for short-term purposes, can be a helpful way of timing payments.\u0026nbsp“But if borrowing builds up without being paid back on a monthly basis, it can become expensive and increasingly difficult to pay off – which is why the regulator is now requiring firms to take steps to help their customers address persistent credit card debt. If you are struggling to manage, seek free advice from a reputable debt charity.”The figures highlight a ide in the UK between those able to borrow at close to record-low rates against the value of their homes and others pressured into taking out high-cost credit in order to make ends meet.While interest rates have remained close to historic lows as the economy continues to grow slowly, the average APR on credit card lending bearing interest was 18.5 per cent in October 2018, higher than the 15 per cent seen in 2006 before the financial crisis.What to do if you want to reduce your credit card debt“Don’t panic,” says David Steele of The Money Charity. “Don’t get pressured into doing something before you have had time to take advice. There are usually managed ways out.”Contact\u0026nbspStepChange\u0026nbspon 0800 138 1111. Their professional advice is completely free and the line is open between\u0026nbsp8am\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp8pm\u0026nbspMonday to Friday, or\u0026nbsp8am\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp4pm\u0026nbspon Saturday.Before you call, fill out\u0026nbspStepChange’s online budget form which helps their advisors understand your particular situation.The charity offers a number of options to help, including debt management plans which allow you to lower your monthly repayments.Other tips from the Money Charity:Pay off more than the minimum amount if you canSome credit cards let you transfer the balance from another card. Transferring a debt from a card with a high rate of interest to one with low or 0 per cent interest could help you pay off the debt faster.Make an assessment of all of your borrowing across cards, loans, overdrafts etc. Make sure you are paying off those with the highest interest rates and charges firstWhen charges are taken into account, overdrafts can sometimes be more expensiveHowever, remember that credit cards should not take priority over debts such as Council Tax, rent or utilities, where the consequences of not paying may be worseA January 2018 report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that one in four of the UK’s poorest households are in arrears with debts or are spending a quarter of their income or more on debt repayments.Borrowers could face a further squeeze with the BoE\u0026nbspexpected to raise its benchmark interest rate further this year, a move that will probably be passed on to consumers.However, millions of consumers do not pay any interest on their credit card debt, either because they clear their balance each month or because they have secured a 0 per cent deal. Just under 45 per cent of credit card balances pay no interest, according to UK Finance, an industry trade body.Those paying high interest rates may be able to transfer their balance to a cheaper card or consolidate their debts into one loan with a lower rate.The average APR for a £5,000 personal loan in October 2018 was 7.7 per cent while for a £10,000 loan it was 3.8 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

For the next few hours, we will be posting our predictions for the night along with any news coming out of Hollywood.\u0026nbspFirst off, our predictions for Best Motion Picture – Drama.\u0026nbspThe nominees are:\u0026nbspBlack Panther,\u0026nbspBlacKkKlansman,\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody,\u0026nbspIf Beale Streat Could Talk and\u0026nbspA Star Is Born.\u0026nbspWill Win: A Star is BornShould Win: If Beale Street Could Talk\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspA Star is Born\u0026nbspmay have its rougher, rawer edges, thanks to the intuitive style of Bradley Cooper – making his directorial debut –\u0026nbspbut the remake is also true to the tone of its three cinematic predecessors. In its telling of the love story between a rising star and her alcoholic mentor, it’s packed with all the big emotions and big drama of a true Hollywood fable – exactly the kind of film HFPA voters adore.\u0026nbspIf Beale Street Could Talk, meanwhile, may not have acquired the same buzz as Barry Jenkins’s directorial debut,\u0026nbspMoonlight, but it’d be refreshing to see an awards body recognise how quickly Jenkins is becoming a major force in modern cinema.\u0026nbspOur predictions for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama\u0026nbspNominees:\u0026nbspGlenn Close,\u0026nbspThe Wife,\u0026nbspLady Gaga,\u0026nbspA Star Is Born,\u0026nbspNicole Kidman,\u0026nbspDestroyer,\u0026nbspMelissa McCarthy,\u0026nbspCan You Ever Forgive Me?,\u0026nbspRosamund Pike,\u0026nbspA Private War\u0026nbspWill Win: Lady Gaga, A Star is BornShould Win: Lady Gaga, A Star is Born\u0026nbspAlthough Lady Gaga’s performance as Ally, the nightclub singer turned pop phenomenon, has been praised as revelatory by some, HFPA voters were already wise to her talents: she picked up the award for Best Actress in a Limited-Series or TV Movie back in 2016 for her deliciously theatrical turn as The Countess on\u0026nbspAmerican Horror Story.\u0026nbspSo there’s surely no doubt that the HFPA will reward her for this undoubtedly mightier performance, which delivers both vulnerability and dignity, making Ally a more grounded version of the classic Hollywood heroine.\u0026nbspOur predictions for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama\u0026nbspNominees: Bradley Cooper,\u0026nbspA Star Is Born,\u0026nbspWillem Dafoe,\u0026nbspAt Eternity\u0027s Gate,\u0026nbspLucas Hedges,\u0026nbspBoy Erased,\u0026nbspRami Malek,\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody,\u0026nbspJohn David Washington,\u0026nbspBlacKkKlansman\u0026nbspWill Win: Rami Malek, Bohemian RhapsodyShould Win: Bradley Cooper, A Star is Born\u0026nbspOur critic says: Rami Malek’s turn as Freddie Mercury in Queen biopic\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody\u0026nbspmay have been praised as a spot-on impression by critics, but the film itself got a mixed reception. It was assumed the film wasn’t good enough to compete on the awards circuit, even before taking into account the sexual assault allegations faced by its director, Bryan Singer.\u0026nbspHowever, HFPA voters can’t seem to resist a film like this, and\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody\u0026nbsphas ended up with several nominations, making it very likely Malek will win in this category. However, as good as Malek’s performance is, he’s not given much material to make his Mercury shine, especially compared to Cooper’s layered performance as tortured country singer Jackson Maine.Our predictions for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy\u0026nbspNominees: Crazy Rich Asians, The Favourite, Green Book, Mary Poppins Returns, Vice\u0026nbspWill Win: Green BookShould Win: The Favourite\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspGreen Book\u0026nbspis officially this year’s\u0026nbspThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri: a film with a significant groundswell of support, but also facing significant criticism for its depiction of race. A buddy comedy about the unexpected friendship between famous pianist Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his driver (Viggo Mortensen), the picture has been praised for delivering a much-needed dose of optimism.\u0026nbspBut it has also been accused of oversimplifying issues of race, and implying that racism is now a thing of the past. Still, the HFPA picked\u0026nbspThree Billboards\u0026nbspover\u0026nbspThe Shape of Water\u0026nbspfor Best Drama in 2018, suggesting the controversy may have little effect on\u0026nbspGreen Book’s chances here. That means ignoring, however, the brilliance of Yorgos Lanthimos’s\u0026nbspThe Favourite, a viciously funny (and, when it needs to be, moving) comedy that rewrites the rules for period films.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOur predictions for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy\u0026nbspNominees:\u0026nbspEmily Blunt,\u0026nbspMary Poppins Returns, Olivia Colman,\u0026nbspThe Favourite, Charlize Theron,\u0026nbspTully, Elsie Fisher,\u0026nbspEighth Grade, Constance Wu,\u0026nbspCrazy Rich Asians\u0026nbspWill Win: Olivia Colman, The FavouriteShould Win: Olivia Colman, The Favourite\u0026nbspOlivia Colman is a national treasure and her work as Queen Anne in\u0026nbspThe Favourite, toying with the two courtiers vying for her affections (Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz), could very well be her best performance yet. The film’s script – which is also likely to win Best Screenplay at the Globes – is an actor’s dream and a formidable showcase for all three of its stars, thanks to its heady mix of absurdism, grandeur, and tragedy.\u0026nbspShe’s surely (yes) the favourite here, and may even have what it takes to beat Gaga to Best Actress at the Academy Awards, although it will be a tight race.\u0026nbspOur predictions for\u0026nbspBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy\u0026nbspNominees: Christian Bale,\u0026nbspVice, Line Manuel Miranda,\u0026nbspMary Poppins Returns, Viggo Mortensen,\u0026nbspGreen Book, Robert Redford,\u0026nbspThe Old Man and the Gun, John C Reilly,\u0026nbspStan \u0026amp Ollie\u0026nbspWill Win: Christian Bale, ViceShould Win: Robert Redford, The Old Man \u0026amp the Gun\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspAwards bodies love a physical transformation, which makes Christian Bale’s unrecognisable turn as Dick Cheney in\u0026nbspVice, a biopic about the former vice president directed by\u0026nbspThe Big Short’s Adam McKay, a strong favourite in this category. Bale is well-known as a method-acting devotee and he certainly gets to go all in as Cheney, from the prosthetics to the mannerisms to the sense of ruthless ambition.\u0026nbspYet it’s such a safe choice for the Golden Globes, especially when compared to Robert Redford’s subtler work in\u0026nbspThe Old Man \u0026amp the Gun, supposedly his final performance and a charming, elegant curtain call for the screen legend.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOur predictions for:\u0026nbspBest Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture\u0026nbspNominees: Amy Adams,\u0026nbspVice, Claire Foy,\u0026nbspFirst Man, Regina King,\u0026nbspIf Beale Street Could Talk, Emma Stone,\u0026nbspThe Favourite, Rachel Weisz,\u0026nbspThe Favourite\u0026nbspWill Win: Regina King, If Beale Street Could TalkShould Win: Regina King, If Beale Street Could Talk\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspAlthough Stone and Weisz, both nominated for their performances in\u0026nbspThe Favourite, are strong contenders here, no one in this category quite dominated the screen like Regina King in\u0026nbspIf Beale Street Could Talk, playing a mother determined to fight for her daughter’s right to a life of love and freedom. It’s a performance where so much of the emotion is held beneath the surface, with many of King’s best moments playing out without dialogue.Our predictions for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture\u0026nbspNominees: Mahershala Ali,\u0026nbspGreen Book, Timothee Chalamet,\u0026nbspBeautiful Boy, Adam Driver,\u0026nbspBlacKkKlansman, Richard E Grant,\u0026nbspCan You Ever Forgive Me?, Sam Rockwell, Vice\u0026nbspWill Win: Mahershala Ali, Green BookShould Win: Richard E Grant, Can You Ever Forgive Me?\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspGreen Book’s strength lies in its two central performances and, if the film itself wins on the night, it seems inevitable that one of its stars will also be rewarded. Mahershala Ali benefits from a less competitive category than his co-star Viggo Mortensen, who is nominated as lead actor. He also gives the more memorable performance, despite having less screen time, playing a man determined to maintain his dignity in a world that’s structured to strip him of it.\u0026nbspHowever, even his work can’t top Richard E Grant’s fragile but sparkling turn as raconteur and petty criminal Jack Hock in\u0026nbspCan You Ever Forgive Me?, a biopic about literary forger Lee Israel.Our predictions for\u0026nbspBest Television Series - Drama\u0026nbspNominees: The Americans, Bodyguard, Homecoming, Killing Eve, Pose\u0026nbspWill Win: Killing EveShould win: Killing Eve\u0026nbspOur critic says: Freed from the behemoth that is\u0026nbspGame of Thrones, which didn’t have any new episodes in 2018, the Golden Globes has the opportunity to award new and original work. Although\u0026nbspPose\u0026nbspwas boundary-breaking in its transgender representation, and a thrilling new addition to Ryan Murphy’s television empire, no other show better fits that category than Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s\u0026nbspKilling Eve, which reinterpreted the spy genre in a masterful, unexpected way.Our predictions for\u0026nbspBest Television Series - Musical or Comedy\u0026nbspNominees: Barry, Good Place, Kidding, Kaminsky Method, Marvelous\u0026nbspMrs\u0026nbspMaisel\u0026nbspWill Win:\u0026nbsp The Marvelous Mrs Maisel​Should Win: The Marvelous Mrs\u0026nbspMaisel\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspThe Golden Globes haven’t rewarded the same show two years in a row since 2010, when\u0026nbspGlee\u0026nbsptriumphed for a second time. However, last year’s winner, Amazon’s\u0026nbspThe Marvelous Mrs Maisel, simply doesn’t have a superior contender amongst this year’s nominees.\u0026nbspIts second season has continued to charm critics with its sense of warmth and humour, carrying on the story of a 1950s housewife pursuing a career in standup comedy. The only show that could possibly have threatened\u0026nbspMaisel’s chances was\u0026nbspAtlanta, 2016’s winner, but the HBO series was bizarrely snubbed in the nominations this year.\u0026nbspOur predictions for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language\u0026nbspNominees: Capernaum, Girl, Never Look Away, Roma, Shoplifters\u0026nbspWill Win: Alfonso Cuarón, RomaShould Win: Alfonso Cuarón, Roma\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspRoma’s glaring omission from the nominations for Best Motion Picture –\u0026nbspDrama isn’t actually a snub, but part of the HFPA’s rules for the Globes: any film entered in its Foreign-Language category cannot then compete for either Best Motion Picture awards. It is, however, eligible in categories such as directing, acting, writing, and score.This means the Globes will give a slightly warped representation of the awards race at large, where the top two competitors have already been narrowed down toRoma\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspA Star is Born. That means the Best Director race comes down to either Cooper or Alfonso Cuarón, although it’s more likely the latter will scoop up the prize, considering\u0026nbspRoma\u0027s\u0026nbspsophisticated construction, taking the intimate story of a maid in Mexico City in the 1970s and weaving it into a wider narrative of the country’s history.\u0026nbspOur predictions for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series - Drama\u0026nbspNominees: Catriona Balfe, Outlander, Elisabeth Moss,\u0026nbspThe Handmaid\u0027s Tale, Sandra Oh, Killing Eve,\u0026nbspJulia Roberts, Homecoming, Keri Russell, The Americans\u0026nbspWill Win: Sandra Oh, Killing EveShould Win: Sandra Oh, Killing Eve\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbsp​Although Sandra Oh will already be gracing the stage as Golden Globes co-host, alongside Andy Samberg, it’s a pretty safe bet that she’ll have to make a quick sprint from backstage to accept this award.Much like\u0026nbspThe Favourite, one of\u0026nbspKilling Eve’s biggest strengths is the depth of material it gives its stars to work with, as Oh nails the balance between the show’s dry sense of humour and the increasing, ragged desperation of her situation, as a deskbound MI5 worker suddenly tangled up in the machinations of a charismatic assassin.\u0026nbspOur predictions for\u0026nbspBest Performance by an Actor In A Television Series - Drama\u0026nbspNominees: Jason Bateman,\u0026nbspOzark, Stephan James,\u0026nbspHomecoming, Richard Madden,\u0026nbspBodyguard, Billy Porter,\u0026nbspPose, Matthew Rhys,\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspAmericans\u0026nbspWill Win: Matthew Rhys, The AmericansShould Win: Matthew Rhys, The Americans\u0026nbsp​Our critic says:\u0026nbspThe Americans\u0026nbsphad its final season last year and it would be quite the mistake not to reward a show that has remained consistently excellent over the course of six season – a relatively rare feat on television. However, the series will have a difficult time competing against\u0026nbspKilling Eve, which benefits from the buzz of being a new show, so it’s likely Matthew Rhys will be the only one to walk away with an award for\u0026nbspThe Americans.Which is no bad news, since his wearied performance as a former undercover Soviet spy, now attempting to embrace the American life, is very much award worthy.\u0026nbspIf you want to watch live, the event is\u0026nbspbeing shown\u0026nbspon NBC in the US.

The announcement led the company\u0027s share price to plunge dramatically, and led to concerns about the future success of the phone.But Mr Cook\u0027s letter to staff suggests that there are a range of successes for Apple away from its Chinese and iPhone troubles, pointing to a range of different business that continue to grow.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAnd he said that he is confident the company\u0027s current run of iPhones\u0026nbsp– the XS, XS Max and XR – are without a doubt, the best iPhones we’ve ever made. But they were not setting sales records, he wrote, due to a number of factors — some macroeconomic, and some specific to Apple and the smartphone industry.He also suggested that the company would nonetheless make changes to its business to respond to the new difficulties.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

He also said the company expected revenue records in a range of markets, including the US, Germany and Italy and other parts of east Asia.Despite those successes, the difficulties would encourage Apple to make changes in the future, he wrote.External forces may push us around a bit, but we are not going to use them as an excuse, he wrote.\u0026nbspNor will we just wait around until they get better.This moment gives us an opportunity to learn and to take action, to focus on our strengths and on Apple’s mission — delivering the best products on earth for our customers and providing them with an unmatched level of service.

The Chinese mission is the first to the far side, sometimes called the dark side because it is relatively unknown.What we will learn from China\u0027s mission to the dark side of the MoonIt has six wheels, according to state media, and can move across the surface at speeds of up to 200 metres per hour. It is still not entirely clear where it will be headed, as the entire moon mission has been largely shrouded in secrecy.But it is carrying a range of experiments, some of which were given to it by other countries. They include seeds that will try and grow on the lunar surface, potentially seeing the first life grow on the far side of the moon.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://www.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/05/19/daily-cartoon-000.jpg","title":"the independent daily cartoon","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

Ms May, speaking at the CBI conference, said it was “important” that the UK had escaped EU rules by the 2022 election, but did not give a guarantee“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break,” said Prof Bale.\u0026nbspThe study found that 59 per cent of Tory members opposed Ms May’s deal, compared to 38 per cent who supported it and 3 per cent who did not have an opinion.More than half, 53 per cent, also said that the deal “does not respect the result of the referendum”, comparing to 42 per cent who said that it does.People were then asked how they would vote in a referendum where there were three options – to remain, leave with the deal or leave without one – and in which they are able to put down a first and second preference.Some 57 per cent opted to leave with no deal as their first choice, with only 23 per cent putting Ms May’s deal and 15 per cent backing the option to remain in the EU.Forty per cent\u0026nbspthen put the prime minister’s proposals as their second choice, with 19 per cent putting no deal and 6\u0026nbspper cent opting to stay as a member of the bloc.The survey showed large majorities of members think both that a no-deal Brexit will have a positive impact on the economy in the medium to long term and that warnings of disruption have been exaggerated.A slim majority, 51 per cent, said they thought Ms May was doing “well”, but almost as many, 48 per cent said she was doing “badly” to some degree.But despite wavering support for Ms May and her deal, an overwhelming majority of members – 83 per cent – opposed the idea of having an election, while 82 per cent would not back a further referendum.Yesterday, the prime minister’s Northern Irish partners in government raised the stakes further in the Brexit talks, saying there is “no need” for key parts of the deal she agreed with the EU.Nigel Dodds, DUP deputy leader,\u0026nbspargued that the withdrawal agreement she is seeking “flies in the face” of the government’s own commitments relating to the border between the north and the republic.His comments came after a meeting in Downing Street, and are a blow to the prime minister as she desperately tries to convince the Northern Irish party and her own MPs to back her proposals ahead of a vote in the coming weeks.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families. In Bangladesh, in 2018, Unicef reached thousands of Rohingya refugee children with mental health and psychosocial support.

We reveal everything.Robert Thompson and Jon Venables were only -years-old when they became the country’s youngest murderers in  years.Little James was led away by the depraved duo while his mother was in a butchers shop at the busy shopping centre.A picture taken from CCTV footage shows the tot being taken by the hand in what would become one of the defining images of the shocking case.The killers walked James for two and half miles and were spotted by  people – some of whom challenged the pair.Venables and Thompson told passers-by that the distressed toddler was their younger brother or that he was lost and they were taking him to a local police station.The pair took James to a railway line and tortured, beat and sexually assaulted him.They poured modelling paint into his eyes, stoned him and clubbed him with bricks and dropped a lbs iron bar on him.Twisted Venables and Thompson then weighted his head down with rubble and lay him across railway tracks hoping he would hit by a train to make the murder look like an accident.Jamie, who suffered  injuries in total, was sliced in half by a train and his body discovered two days later.The tragic tot was born on March , , in Merseyside.He was killed on February ,  - a month before his third birthday.Jamie would now be  years old.The couple split after the tragedy but both tirelessly fought against their sons killers being given anonymity and a new identity.Ralph pleaded with authorities on February  to unmask Venables before he can claim any more victims.Venables – now in his mid-s – was sent back to prison for three years and four months after admitting having more than , indecent images of children aged -.Ralph said giving him lelong anonymity was “a failed experiment” and claimed the authorities could not manage him in the community.His solicitor Robin Makin said: “We are immensely concerned about the danger that Jon Venables would posehe is released again.“Due to his innate nature, there has to be a fundamental reassessment of the injunction order.“It not only affects James’ family but the general public as well – and it involves astronomical amounts of money.“It seems to be perfectly obvious that Jon Venables can’t cope living the lie and the authorities haven’t been able to manage him in the community.“He’s already reverted to committing further offences and we have to wonder where this is going to lead.”Denise recently released a book called I Let Him Go to mark the th anniversary of her sons death.The book, which was released on January , is a heart-breaking account of how she is haunted by the events of that day. Jamie has a brother Michael, who Denise was pregnant with at the time of the trial while still married to Ralph.He spoke out in , saying: It upsets me to think that two ten-year-olds could do that to my brother. I will never understand it and I can never forgive them, but I am not consumed with hate or thoughts of revenge.I just want to get on with my le and look to the future, not the past. I don’t want to sink to their level.Denise met electrician Stuart Fergus when Michael was two and they married  years ago.They had two sons together called Thomas and Leon.Meanwhile, in , Ralphs partner Natalie McDermott gave birth to a baby girl. The pair chose not to reveal her name but use the nickname Princess.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its like a tsunami - you know its coming but when it hits you think oh f***, hold tight.“Watching what Ive been through will be mental and probably will be emotional as youre having to constantly relive it.Its glorying him even more, but he is notorious and one of the most prolic murderers in the country.Earlier this week, Joe was once again reminded of her killer ex when a new report claimed he was part of paedophile ring that groomed teenage girls.Joe says she was not shocked by the news.She said: “The sex grooming reports arent a surprise to me. Ive given names before. Id already given the police two names years ago in numerous interviews.“He had a fteen year old living with him at one point and she used to have all her friends round. One of his friends told me it was like a nursery round there - there were so many kids.“The fact that hes so obsessed with school girls anyway - it goes hand in hand. Its obvious.”Today, Joe is confident and bubbly, but shell never be able to forget the campaign of abuse she endured at the hands of cruel Bellfield, who used to brag about raping other women while he was with her.I have a few questions I’d like to ask him, she says. What actual pleasure did he get out of it all ”Joe adds: “I told the police in an interview I did that I’d get back with him tomorrow - because he’d have the best meal, the best day, the best sex, and I’d slit the c***’s throat as he slept and put an end to all of it, because it’s all of us lot paying for him to live his le of luxury.”And she still stands by this sentiment, adding: The victims haven’t got that, so why should he be allowed to be a fat f**k in prison Joe initially met Bellfield in  when she was  and regularly went to a bar in Cobham, called Rockys, where he worked as a doorman. But it wasn’t until some years later, in , that they began dating - and another decade would pass before Bellfields true depravity was revealed to the world. Bellfields first victim would turn out to be Milly Dowler, who went missing from Walton-Upon-Thames on her way home from school in .Her body was found six months later, dumped in a wood in Yateley Heath, in a horric case that went unsolved for nine years, with Bellfield eventually convicted in .Then in  Marsha McDonnell was hit over the head with a blunt instrument after she got off the bus near her home in Hampton, London, and in August  French student Amelie Delagrange was found battered to death in the street in Twickenham.Joe, who is now a horse groomer, can still remember in vivid detail the start of her horrying relationship with the hulking killer.  says: “He was huge. He was a big bloke. I didnt fancy him at first, but he was a proper ladies’ man - everyone knew that.“Then my dad died, and I was in a vulnerable place. He kept on askingI wanted to go for a drink and a meal, and in the end I did.“He stayed that night, and never left.”At the start of their relationship, there weren’t any signs Bellfield was evil. She says: “He’d turn up with flowers and was a gentleman. When he wasn’t psychotic, you couldn’t want for a better boyfriend.”However, almost immediately after Joe fell pregnant with their daughter Bellfield turned aggressive.Joe says: He started with the odd slap. He came home annoyed one night - there was no reason, it was out of the blue.“I was shocked, but my hormones were all over the place and I was still upset about my dad.“I believed him when he said it was because he loved me and he was jealous.“He was convinced Id been having affairs even though I hadnt even left the house - and he couldn’t help it and he was really sorry.”From there the abuse got worse, and by the time Joe fell pregnant with her son in , daily le had become hell.Joe says: “One time he came home from work and I answered him back and he went mental – punching, biting, kicking, pinching.“Towards the end of the relationship he’d use weapons. He hit me with a rubber mallet, he’d burn me with cigarettes - he’d bruise and cut me but it was always from the neck down.And the torment didnt end there, with rapist Bellfield frequently forcing himself on her at any hour of the day.Hed rape me. It didnt matter where we were -he wanted it, he took it, she says. You didn’t argue. You could fight but you’d always lose. It could be weekly, daily - over that period it was over  times.“He’d call me fat, stupid, say how useless I was as a mum, that I had no friends. You start to believe it.” Le became a vicious cycle of control. She says: “He was brilliant when my daughter was born. Hed always have time for the kids, and they were always well-dressed. This is why I don’t understand how he can take other people’s children away from them, because as a father he was very good.“Even after he beat the s**t out of you he’d still buy you things – sovereign rings, Kickers shoes, take you on holiday, clothes, stuff for the horses. Sometimes he’d say he was sorry but he would then start to say it was your fault. It was like he had multiple personalities.“They make you believe you’re a piece of s**t on the floor.“When people say why didn’t you walk away the first time  Until you’re in this situation and you’re living that le, you can’t know what it’s like.“I was just target practice. He was just warming up.”Bellfield – who has converted to Islam now and goes by the name Yusuf Rahim while in HMP Frankland – regularly bragged about raping girls when he ed from work as a doorman, according to Joe. But without evidence, she was too scared to say anything.Joe says: “I knew about a lot of the rapes. He’d come home bragging about it, but when I was in that position with two kids, what could I do  I’ve got to live with the guilt every day knowing potentially I could have stopped him, but there was never enough people to come forward.Imagine knowing what he is, and what he’s like - he gets arrested, gets questioned and gets let out - who’s going to get it  I fought for my le everyday - I was terried for my own le.“He bragged about raping a disabled girl on the bonnet of the car in the car park of a club. There were doormen who were there that knew, and nothing was ever done about it.Joe eventually split from Bellfield after he beat her up while heavily pregnant with their son, who was born in . She sought an injunction but Bellfield ignored it.Despite moving on with another girlfriend, Bellfield continued to terrorise Joe for years – while going on to commit multiple murders over a three year period. And it was Joe who finally exacted revenge on her evil ex by helping to bring him to justice.Joe got in touch with police after spotting Bellfield’s car on a Crimewatch programme about the attempted murder of schoolgirl Kate Sheedy in .The -year-old had been hit by a white people carrier Joe recognised as Levi’s, reversed over, and left for dead.With the help of Joe’s statements, Bellfield was convicted in  and given a full le sentence for the murder of Marsha and Amelie, and the attempted murder of Kate. He was later given the same sentence in , when he was found guilty of murdering -year-old Milly Dowler.Recalling the time that she saw his car on Crimewatch, Joe says: I was still in touch with Levi, but no longer felt scared of him. Hed moved on, he wasnt living with me anymore and I had more freedom so it was totally dferent. I called the police anonymously and told them that white people carrier had been on my driveway a couple of weeks before and it was my baby father’s car. However nothing was done at that point.“I can tell you nearly all his cars – the reg, the colour – because he stalked my le daily for  years, and would be in dferent cars all the time. You were always aware of him being around. Later that year Joe went to the police again, after the murder of Amelie.“I went into the incident room on Twickenham Green and told them Levi was a wheel clamper, had a white van and hated blondes.”Joe came face-to-face with Bellfield once again while giving evidence at Milly Dowler’s court without a screen. She says: “The last time I saw him was at the Old Bailey, and he stared back at me, he was so p***ed off.“I had photos showing hed been to Yateley horse show - the same area Millys body was found.”Today, Joe is eager to put her old le as far behind her as much as she can. She has created a new le and has been in a new relationship for nine months.“My son initially wanted to go and see Levi in prison when he was about ten, she says. I wasn’t happy about it but thankfully he changed his mind. It’s not my place to stop them seeing himthey want to.”She spends most of her time travelling for work or looking after her kids, her elderly mum and five horses, but she’s still scared by the psychological torment she suffered.She says: “I still don’t trust any guy. The minute they tell you they’ll never hurt you or cheat on you, they’re gone.“I’ve had one serious relationship since I’ve split up with him. Some friends laugh and call me ‘man hater’, but why should you trust when you’ve been through that “There’ll be god knows how many things he’s done that the police don’t know about and they’ll never know about.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Really I only ask because when the fly-by happened on New Year’s Day, the space craft was traveling at ,mph.This is known in technical circles as “very fast”.And think about it. If you try to take pictures of the underside of a motorway bridge as you pass by, you’re not going to learn much.And you’re only doing .So what nuggets of information came back from the edge of our solar system Ah well. Because the probe only has a -watt transmitter and because it’s four billion miles from earth and because the sun’s currently in the wrong place, we won’t have all the graphs and the algebra for  months.By which time, the boffins will have been given another gazillion dollars to go and look at another bit of frozen rock.I’m not one of those people who say the money should be spent on blankets for refugees.But can we stop pretending that space is a big encyclopaedia of facts we need to know Because it isn’t. The moon taught us nothing of any great consequence.Missions to Mars have given us nothing but a very good film starring Matt Damon and all we know about the bit between is that it’s cold and empty.Yes, further out, beyond the Thermal Shock Region, ten or five thousand galaxies from here, there could be all sorts of juicy titbits for the boffins to analyse.But we can’t get there.And we never will.Becauseyou were on a space ship that took off like the Enterprise, you’d fall over.So let’s concentrate our efforts on something which IS achievable.Turning space travel into the ultimate zero-g theme park ride for tourists.A CHINESE space craft landed on the Moon this week.I anticipate it will learn nothing of any great value but that, within a week, it will have built a factory that makes , pairs of training shoes every month.LIKE many other bores and cowards, I decided on New Year’s Eve to quit drinking for a little while.As I write, it’s lunch time on January  and already, a small rash has developed on my stomach.I looked it up on the internet and, of course, it’s cancer.I was going to have a drink to help me think about that but then I noticed that the pain in my hip is also cancer and so is my failing eyesight and so is my deafness and so is my wonky ankle and so is every symptom anyone has ever developed anywhere.As a research tool, the internet is brilliant. As a doctor, however, it’s scary . . . and almost always wrong.THERE are many noble and well-meaning attempts to make people stop filling the sea with bits of discarded plastic.Iceland, the supermarket chain, has started a “reverse vending machine” scheme which gives you a ten pence voucher for every empty plastic bottle you deposit.And there are many volunteers who comb the world’s coastlines, pulling plastic bags from the mouths of turtles and stranded dolphins.I wish all these people well.But I think a more targeted approach is necessary.Every time I go for a walk on Britain’s coastline, I notice that the high-tide mark is always littered with the plastic wrappers from milk chocolate Bounty bars and Flora margarine tubs.So how’s this for a plan You go to the people who make these things and you give them an ultimatum.Do something about it. Or we will do something to you, involving sharks.AS I watched the fireworks light up the night sky over London on New Year’s Eve, I wondered how long it would take someone to say the money should have been spent on the NHS.The answer, very depressingly, was about four seconds.Well, let me provide a retort.The amount of public money spent on the fireworks was £.million.Which isn’t even enough to buy one decent MRI scanner.Let me put it this way.You could save all your money for a rainy day and live on gruel.But it’s nice once in a while to spend a bit of it on beer and curry.MANY don’t enjoy the first few weeks of the year because it’s usually cold and dark and miserable.I love it though because all my friends are back from their Christmas holidays.Which means my Instagram feed is no longer full of their legs on a beach with nothing in the background but the blue sea and the bloody blue sky.I’M delighted to hear that Olivia Newton John isn’t as poorly as was reported earlier.I’ve always been a fan.Once, in fact, I wrote to Jim’ll Fix It askinghe could fix it for me to sleep with her.The filthy little pervert never even replied.THERE are so many exciting new things set to lt our spirits in .We have what will probably be the last Avengers movie and, a quarter of a century after the original, a new Toy Story.On the small screen, Game Of Thrones will be back and there will be world cups in rugby and cricket.The soundtrack will be provided by the Spice Girls reunion and . . .  none of you will be paying attention to any of it because this month, Theresa May’s useless Brexit deal will be dashed on the foreshore of democratic debate.This will cause Corbyn to propose a vote of no confidence which will trigger a general election.And the winner of that will stage a second referendum which will provide the same result as the first so there will be riots, petrol bombs, power cuts, death and the end of days.Despite this, though, I’d like to wish you all a happy New Year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rest will soldier on.The Sun has far less confidence in a Government that has so far proved utterly shambolic and just as reliant on dishonest spin as Tony Blair was.If there is chaos at our ports,prices rise,there are temporary shortages, do we trust Chris Grayling to sort them out after his rail, drones and ferries fiascos  How about self-promoting “The Sajid” Javid  Or clueless Karen Bradley  Or spineless David Gauke Does glum bean-counter Philip Hammond have it in him to slash taxes and turbo-charge the economy  Does he hell.True, at least Theresa May’s Cabinet aren’t Corbyn, McDonnell and Abbott.But, with a couple of exceptions, that’s all her lacklustre crew have going for them.TORY Brexiteers and the DUP won’t back Mrs May’s deal without a legal guarantee that we can exit the toxic Irish “backstop”.Not for nothing is No’s effort to extract some vague new promise from Brussels nicknamed “Operation Figleaf”. That’s all it would be.Many Brexiteers are unafraid of No Deal, or willing to bet Leave would win any second referendum comfortably. They prefer either to surrendering our economic future to Brussels for ever.If EU leaders genuinely want this signed off they are going the wrong way about it.A SOBERING week for Ireland’s gobby PM.After all his naïve grandstanding, aimed at thwarting Brexit, Leo Varadkar is on the brink of begging the EU for a huge bailoutthere’s a No Deal.He could have spent two years talking sense into Brussels, working on a decent deal to suit them and us. Instead he acted as their patsy, issuing childish threats and hyping up the hard-border myth . . . just as the EU wanted.Now his farmers face potential ruin, and he may need a “mega money” rescue.Hate to say it, Leo. But we did tell you.A FEW selfish rotters have won the Lottery over the years.How refreshing, then, that £million EuroMillions couple Frances and Patrick Connolly aim to make dozens of others rich too. “It’s going to be so much fun giving it away,” Frances says.Good luck to them.

There is nothing cosier than the cocoon of Christmas. And leaving it is a wrench.So a lot of people will be full of dread at the prospect of going back to work.But I actually think that January can be one of the most productive, exciting and dynamic months.And just in case you don’t agree, I’m going to share my tips on how to make January into Fanuary.The first step is to focus on what you want out of this new year. Becauseyou don’t make a plan you will end up exactly where you started, but this time in .If you hate your job, don’t just keep saying that: Work out why you hate it and what steps you need to take to change it. Brush up on your skills. Look for learning opportunities wherever you can — and take them.Be active and invest time in yourself. Dare to dream a bit by applying for jobs you like the look of, evenyou think they are out of your league.Andyou need a helping hand, sign up to my masterclass which will help you to write a killer CV — and even get the pay rise you want.It’s also really important to be positive — evenyou don’t always feel it.If you are surrounded by miserable, negative people you will end up that way too, so go out of your way to mix with positive, enthusiastic types.It’s very easy to stay in your comfort zone but you’ll never know what you are capable of achieving unless you try. Be brave and start taking risks.Another scenario is that you might not hate your job, but wish you felt more challenged, appreciated or engaged.If that’s the case, write a list of things you would doyou were fearless. Then act asyou were. Take small steps: Speak up in a meeting or put yourself forward for something you’ve never done before.And evenyou fail, be proud that you’ve tried.It’s also important to trust yourself — that’s the first step to improving your self image.If you lack self-confidence you won’t achieve much.You might be thinking, “It’s easy for you to say that — you’re successful”.But after my A-levels I never went to uni, and had no other qualications.I had to work really hard and be super-resilient because I could only ever rely on myself.On the way to success you’ll inevitably experience setbacks — but it’s how you respond to them that determines what happens next. Trust that you can handle them.One of the core communication skills is to be assertive, so try to have faith in your opinions. Sure, respect other people’s views but respect your own too.If you’re hoping for a pay rise or promotion in , I firmly believe thatyou don’t ask you don’t get.If the answer is no the first time round, find out what needs to change and work on that so that next time the answer is a yes.Personally, I never hear the word “No”.I hear: “Find another way to get what you want.”Most importantly, never stop encouraging yourself — and find a network to plug into.To network, you have to be ­interested and interesting. First impressions are made in the first seven seconds so, when you meet someone, make eye contact, smile, be polite — and dress the part.Put your phone away and work out an articulate way to explain who you are in  seconds. Be enthusiastic and be your own best friend.Feeling better about January now  I hope so.If you really want to Get What You Want — sign up to my new Masterclass and make this year all about you.IT’S not really a newsflash that British children are addicted to sugar. But the problem is worse than we might have thought.New research shows that from the age of two, children are consuming an average of almost oz of sugar a day, which is more than twice the recommended maximum daily allowance.This is not just destroying our young people’s teeth. Britain now has the worst obesity rate in Western Europe.Being overweight increases the risk of major health problems including Type  diabetes.So this is an unprecedented health crisis waiting to happen.And the reality is it’s not the fault of the Government, the NHS or the schools – it’s down to parents.It’s our responsibility to read food labels and cook healthy meals from scratch rather than relying on ready meals and takeaways.We also need to teach our kids to make good choices themselves and to develop a taste for healthy food.Unfortunately, though, the hardest word in the English language is “No”.Saying: “No, you can’t have sweets, crisps, fizzy drinks or sugary cereal” can be hard.And, often, it’s so much easier to say yes. Sure, you certainly get an easier le, but you’ll also have an obese, unhealthy and unhappy child.Obesity is now a disease. And it’s almost always a self- inflicted one, which takes years off our lives.The good news is that it’s reversible.Perhaps eating less sugar is one new year’s resolution we should all aspire to keep ANYONE  joining me by doing a Dry January this year I’m becoming a bit of a pro since I seem to do it every year.And while I wish I had some uplting advice about how to get through it, the reality is that I am prepared for a depressing, miserable boring month.The only way to survive it is to not go out, not have friends over, do absolutely zilch and just keep on sipping water.I suppose that’s the whole point, in a way.So welcome to the wagon – but roll on February.HUGE congratulations to Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch on the announcement that they are expecting their fourth child.And also . . . isn’t Abbey looking fabulous in her Instagram snap Most of us, me included, looked like a bag of spuds after two children. But she has three kids already and another on the way and still looks incredible.I guess that’s a combination of good genes, good diet and the right exercise. But whatever she is doing, it’s working. Good for her!SOMETHING tells me that Justin Bieber might regret his new tattoo.He’s had the word “Grace” inked above his eyebrow, which is a lovely sentiment, but at first glance I’m sorry to say it looks a bit like he’s had stitches.And that’s not going to be a great image when he is .I’ve never understood tattoos – let alone on the face – and especially when the result looks like you’ve had a am trip to AE.I’M so happy to hear that every child is going to learn basic first aid including CPR in school to help boost heart attack survival rates.Education Secretary Damian Hinds has announced that he wants all pupils to be able to give emergency care by the time they leave school so more lives can be saved.All I can say is: About time.I did an advanced first aid course and now offer them to all my employees at West Ham.

Will it be a General Election, a second referendum, the Government’s deal or a “no deal” exit My guess is that the last two are the most likely.Theresa May’s tactic is to run down the clock until MPs feel they have no option but to back the Government’s deal and avoid a no-deal departure.The Government has been blitzing constituencies to put pressure on MPs via their supporters.But a recent poll indicated that  per cent of Conservative constituency workers think a no-deal Brexit would be better than the PM’s deal.So that tactic hasn’t worked, and a nasty Commons confrontation looms.It is not surprising that David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, has suggested the PM should postpone the vote for a second time.It is the Irish backstop, that tortuous measure which binds Northern Ireland closely to EU regulations, which has caused the most dficulty, particularly as the Government is dependent on DUP votes for its survival.To the DUP it is unacceptable that there should, in effect, be a border down the Irish Sea. To Conservative MPs there is also the danger of being locked into the backstop indefinitely and that, having already agreed to accept £billion, the EU would have no incentive to move on and negotiate a decent Free Trade agreement.If the PM could somehow get firm assurances from the EU that would guarantee the backstop was definitely a temporary measure then that might persuade MPs, including the DUP, to change their minds.After all,the backstop is only temporary, all the things that are objectionable in the backstop, such as the inability to sign new trade deals, are also only temporary.It is not impossible that there could be a concession on these lines. Butthe Government is defeated in the Commons, what then In some ways the PM’s hand might be strengthened and she could say to Brussels that it is absolutely clear the present deal cannot get through ­Parliament.The EU will maintain that its offer is final, but this would not be the first time the EU has said that, only for a new offer to then appear.Opponents of Brexit cling to the hope that defeat in the Commons will lead either to a second referendum or a General Election. But neither will happen automatically.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a General Election can only be heldParliament votes for one or the Government loses a vote of ­confidence.The DUP don’t want Jeremy Corbyn as PM and as long as Mrs May’s deal has not passed, the DUP will continue to support the Government.A second referendum could only happenthe Government introduced legislation for one. No Conservative PM would survive doing that.The remaining option is the so- called no-deal Brexit, which really means trading on World Trade ­Organisation terms with both the EU and the rest of the world.This is how much of world trade is conducted and how many countries outside the EU trade with the EU.Strictly speaking there is no such thing as a no-deal Brexit.There would be many side deals covering administrative areas that are not strictly trade, such as health regulations, safety, aviation, transportion of animals and so on.No one is claiming there would be no problems. Inevitably there will be some, but they would essentially be short term, and we would not face a bill of £billion.Leaving without a deal is feared by some large businesses anxious that integrated manufacturing supply chains might be interrupted. But Britain imports manufacturing components already from many non-EU areas of the world. These issues are solvable.Roberto Azevedo, Director General of the World Trade Organisation, has said there is no reason why trading on WTO terms should lead to disruption.He presumably knows what he is talking about.But the Government seems unable to make up its mind about a no-deal Brexit.Originally the PM boldly declared: “No deal is better than a bad deal”. Presumably she meant it.But recently the Government has launched Project Fear Mark , highlighting the alleged disaster of a no-deal Brexit in a lurid way.This campaign provoked a civil servant to write a remarkable anonymous article in a national ­newspaper declaring that “the civil ­service was ready for no-deal”, advanced preparations had been made and she accused the Government of deliberately concealing the work that had been done in order to pressurise MPs to swallow the ­Government’s “disastrous deal”.It seems probable that the Government will not be able to get the PM’s deal through Parliament and so will have to go back to Brussels, not just once, but maybe several times.If the EU refuses to budge, the automatic legal position is that the UK will leave on March , eventhere is no deal and stalemate in Parliament.There is very little that Parliament can do to stop that now. It is what Parliament has voted for in the past.My guess is that the EU may well come up with some concession, perhaps a legally binding clarication, and that there will be a lot of arguing, probably right up to midnight on March .But whatever happens, the next day we will leave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The MPs - from both Labour, the Tories and other parties - want a mechanism that will prevent the UK leaving without agreement on March . They fear Britain could be plunged into a No Deal situation costing thousands of British manufacturing jobs , as expected, Theresa Mays deal is voted down next Tuesday. The letter was organised by Tory former Cabinet minister Dame Caroline Spelman and Labours Jack Dromey and signed from MPs. In a sign of No being spooked by the letter, all its signatories have been invited to meet the Prime Minister in Downing Street tomorrow.  They write: We are united in our determination that the UK must not crash out of the EU without a deal.We urge the Government to agree a mechanism that would ensure a ‘No Deal’ Brexit could not take place and are confident this is a path that Parliament would support. Dame Caroline told BBC Radio s Westminster Hour: Crashing out of the EU without a deal will cause job losses and bring to an end the renaissance of manufacturing that weve seen in regions like mine in the West Midlands. Both Jack Dromey and I know the human interest and impact of this. It comes as senior MPs launch a separate campaign to rewrite legislation to block a no-deal Brexit. Under the plans backed by Tory and Labour ex-ministers, the Government would be blocked from implementing no-deal measures without the explicit consent of Parliament. A separate measure backed by the Liberal Democrats and other opposition parties would prevent the Government collecting key taxes unless Parliament has approved its approach to Brexit. The tactics involve submitting amendments to the Budget-enacting Finance Bill which s to the Commons on Tuesday. A vote on the Brexit deal is now set on Tuesday  January.  The vote had to be delayed by more than a month after more than  Tories indicated they would vote against the Brexit deal. Theresa May went back to the EU to try and get new concessions on a backstop clause, which could trap the UK in EU customs rules indefinitely after . But EU chiefs said the deal would not be renegotiated and Tories and the DUP who oppose the deal have warned they are not changing their minds.

The high-profile group has drawn up a motion which it expects dozens of constituency parties to adopt. Thousands of Labour members have already contacted the party before its national policy forum this week. The Commission, which includes Ann Pettor, former economic advisor to John McDonnell, and union chief Manuel Cortes, hopes to plot a way to remain in a reformed EU. Although they are supportive of Mr Corbyn’s leadership they believe it could be under threathe fails to oppose Mrs May’s Brexit plan and back a second vote.  They want him to commit to offering a referendum on a renegotiated deal with the EU - even though Brussels has suggested the PM’s plan is the best on offer and that time is running out. TSSA union chief Mr Cortes said: “The easiest way out of this cul-de-sac is to trust the wisdom of the British people by giving them a say in what we do next.” Ms Pettor added: “The risk to [Corbyn] is that we will not get a Labour Government. There are some people very close to him who would rather have us out of the European union than have a Labour government.” Mr Corbyn angered party members when he said that Labour would pursue a negotiated Brexit deal evenit won a snap general election. But shadow cabinet minister Barry Gardiner suggested Labour could offer a second referendum on a Brexit deal it had renegotiated with the EU.  The shadow trade secretary said Labour could campaign for a general election on a promise to secure a better deal than the PM. He said he personally believed that any such deal could then be put to the public. “It seems to me, at a personal level, what I would then say is that is the time when we would then say to people, ‘now make your decision on what we have managed to conclude,’” he said. Labour’s official policy is to push for a general electionMrs May fails to get her Brexit deal past MPs, but that all other options remain on the table.

But campaigners mocked the number of trucks trooping down the A - which included two international removal trucks and a Thanet Council bin lorry. The government confirmed  vehicles attended, despite a letter last week appealing for  to  to take part. The first batch also left at .am, despite an am predicted set-off time and warnings that even a momentary delay at ports could cause chaos on Kents roads. A government source insisted: The dropout was expected and were satisfied with the number taking part in the test today. But anti-Brexit Labour MP Stephen Doughty said: This is yet more extraordinary incompetence from this shambolic government.  Ferries from phantom companies. Billions being poured down the drain. And now they can’t even count lorries. No wonder the public are rapidly losing any confidence in them to deliver Brexit and are demanding a final say. This chaos is not what anyone voted for. Astonished Twitter users mocked the total saying we cant even organise a good queue anymore and the Tories cant even organise a traffic jam. Dover is said to handle around , lorries a day at busy times. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, of the anti-Brexit Best For Britain campaign, said: This is a taxpayer funded farce. No deal doesnt need to be a real prospect but the government are just throwing money down the drain for effect. The idea that creating a fake traffic jam will show the EU we are ready for no deal is just plain stupid.  The trial, called Operation Brock, is testing out the site as a mass HGV holding bay to ease congestion on roads to Channel ports.

Nothing has changed when next week’s crucial vote in Parliament could be postponed again and a PM who is denying people another vote might push for her own in the House of Commons. In her TV interview, the clacking of the PM’s necklace beads was the death rattle of an inadequate leader at a seismic moment for the UK. Honesty could offer May salvation, but she is hell-bent on following the Brown Brexit Road to a sticky end. When this vicar’s daughter condemns children to foodbank charity she is no brave Dorothy, the sweet star of The Wizard of Oz.

Nothing has changed when she would not vote for her own Tory mess in a referendum. Finding a way forward is dficultnot impossible.

The Brextremist liars are already costing us a fortune in NHS fridges, customs officials, empty lorries trundling around Kent, phantom ferries, dredged ports, renegotiated air deals, lost investment, squeezed living standards and economic growth. The time, energy and money squandered on the madness of Brexit so that plastic patriots can wave blue passports printed by a French company on Dependence Day is the gravest folly since the Second World War. May could stop it all, stand up and declare what was promised cannot be delivered. And now that we know the truth, the people should be allowed to decide. But she won’t do it.

The poundbillion extra by  promised again today by the Prime Minister is barely enough to keep pace with growing demand, never mind repair the terrible damage inflicted by the nine-year most-ruthless spending squeeze in NHS history.Repeatedly missing accident and emergency, cancer and operation targets with waiting lists growing to . million and ,-plus job vacancies is a sick record for the Tories. If May wants a pat on the back, I suggest she do it herself then book a physiotherapy appointment to repair the dislocated shoulder.

Currently two Royal Navy River class ships, HMS Mersey and HMS Tyne, make up the Fishery Protection Squadron , which detects foreign trawlers illegally fishing in our waters. But with Brexit just three months away, the Home Secretary has ‘borrowed’ HMS Mersey at a reported cost of pound, a day, to patrol the Dover straits, for up to  days. Public Accounts Committee chair Meg Hillier branded the move “an incredibly expensive sledgehammer to crack a nut.” And with the Ministry of Defence’s promise of five new Navy ships for the FPS not due until , it leaves just one ship, HMS Tyne, covering the entire of England’s fishing waters.   Budget cuts have already seen the FPS slash its patrolling hours from , hours per month in  to just , hours last year. The number of vessels boarded fell from , in - to  in -. And convictions or penalties following boardings dropped from  to just six in the same period. Catherine Stihler, Labour MEP and Best for Britain champion, said: “The UK’s patrol vessels play a key role in protecting our fisheries ensure a fast response to any incidents. “Using a ship to instead patrol for migrants will leave tens of thousands of square miles of fishing waters less protected, with the Brexit deadline just weeks away. “The Home Secretary should be focusing on much better cooperation with the French authorities, and nations across the EU, to create safe and legal routes for those seeking asylum. Nobody should feel they have no option but to risk their lives by crossing the channel in this way. “Unfortunately, the UK Government’s calamitous Brexit strategy has seriously damaged the relationship with our European allies, and the best way to mend that is by remaining in the EU through a people’s vote.” In , Lord West, the former First Sea Lord, warned the decline in patrols would encourage foreign fishermen to ignore attempts by Britain to secure its fishing waters after Brexit. He told the Times: “Britain will become a laughing stockwe apply rules but cannot enforce them.”   The FPS currently has three patrol vessels, two of which are in normally on duty in English waters. Giving evidence to Parliament last month , Phil Haslam, director of operations at the Marine Management Organisation, said there was an “increased risk across the piece” of foreign vessels trying to fish illegally in English waters. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “I can confirm that HMS Mersey will deploy to the Dover Straits to assist the UK Border Force and French authorities with their response to migrant crossings. “The professionalism of the Royal Navy means the crew have been able to immediately ert from routine operations to help prevent migrants from making the dangerous journey across the Channel.” The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has been approached for comment.

The Cannes Palme dOr winner, which had its BBC premiere on Saturday, follows -year-old carpenter Daniel Blake in a nightmarish journey through the benefits system in Newcastle. Jeremy Corbyn said the film shows the human cost of this Tory Governments cruel welfare policies and is one of the most moving films I have ever seen. But Mr Cleverly said the film, which portrays a fictional story but is inspired by real hardship, was powerful and moving but political polemic and not a documentary.Mr Lavery said the MPs words would cause deep hurt to his constituents using Northumberlands Wansbeck Valley Foodbank to provide for their children due to welfare sanctions. In a letter to Mr Cleverly today, Mr Lavery wrote: I was bitterly disappointed to see the ignorance and callousness your words exemplied as you insinuated that the reality of many thousands of UK citizens was simply a work of fiction. I can only conclude from your lack of compassion or understanding that you inhabit an entirely dferent reality to that of my constituents.As a result I would like to invite you to visit the north east and accompany me to see the poverty and desperation many people face every single day.  Mr Cleverly sparked a Twitter row over the weekend - as it emerged ministers are shelving a vote on the controversial rollout of Universal Credit to million people. MPs will no longer be asked to pre-approve the managed migration of existing benefit claimants onto UC between  and . Instead they will only be asked to approve a ,-strong trial, before voting on the movement of million people at a later date.  Mr Cleverly, the MP for Braintree, posted a y rebuttal after the row erupted. He wrote: I regularly help constituents who have had problems with the benefits system. I know that it is far from perfect, can be intimidating and mistakes can have devastating consequences. But he said Labour have always left government with unemployment higher than when they came in. Their economic mismanagement hits the very people they claim to champion.  And he added: I Daniel Blake, is a powerful and moving film. But it is a political polemic and is particularly unfair on the public sector professionals who work in Job Centre Plus, in my experience they are proactive and helpful. Completely at odds with their portrayal in the film. Citing this film as proof of how the benefits system works, as a number of Labour MPs have done, is simply wrong.

But what sort of parent decides to hurt those children as a result When Valentina Naidenko discovered her daughter had been swapped with that of another woman in a hospital blunder  years earlier, she did not rail or blame. She said: I am happy that I now know. Svetlana is my daughter. And Katya is my daughter too, this is how it is. When Maria Gerbeno was sent home from hospital with a baby that wasnt hers, she started legal action for DNA tests, but didnt spit her dummy. She said: I spent three weeks with a baby that was not my daughter but I gave her all my love and knew that the other mum would be doing the same. But when father-of-three Richard Mason found out he had been infertile all along, he lashed out at his adulterous we, launched legal action, and demanded his money back. Its not surprising two of his sons no longer speak to him its a quandary why the third is still bothering.  Parenthood - biological or adoptive - demands that you put someone s needs before your own. It applies equally to mums and dads. And in his rage, Richard Mason has all but written off his children. As a co-founder of comparison site Moneysupermarket, he made poundm overnight when the firm floated in . That same year, he split up with his we Kate, who he had been married to for  years. They agreed a orce settlement of poundm, much of which was an advance payment for his childrens private school fees. According to reports, in the first years of their separation he paid her pound, a year in child maintenance. A nice wage for many, but a drop in the ocean for him - even assuming he never made a penny extra in interest or earnings, it represented just .% of his remaining wealth.  In  Richard was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a disease which had led to the death of his sister. While fumbling to grasp his own mortality, he was given a second blow when the doctor said he was probably infertile, too. He texted his ex to askthe children, the oldest then aged  and twins aged , were his she assured him they were. At this stage a decent parent would ask themselves whether further questions would harm their children, who had already endured a orce. Not even the most mediocre of parents would feel their now-grown children would enjoy having old marital wounds reopened. Richard Mason, though, sought out the UK expert on paternity fraud and launched legal action. He did so even though his oldest son warned him it would mean they never spoke again.  Ive been the victim of adultery. Its horrendous, and betrayal hurts whether you find out at the time or a decade later. The first reaction is always to kick down doors, wail, and throw lawyers at the partner you now hate. But when you have children, your rage is qualied because you have to put them first. Or you should, unless youre Richard Mason and still fairly upset about the -odd % of your wealth which the law required you to spend on the family you used to have. . Instead he decided to settle some scores, not just with his ex but with her lover too.  So he launched a bid for some of his poundm back, and got pound,. But it still wasnt enough. He disbelieved his wes denials, so told their oldest son he was infertile even before it had been confirmed. The son confronted his mum, who confessed to an affair. Richards opinion about who was the biggest victim is clear. I was just thinking, s*** my le is ruined... Im just a guy who was there when they were brought up. He now refers to the boys, in conversations with others, as the sons I thought were mine. He plans to tell his -year-old mother with Alzheimers that she no longer has grandchildren. He believes birthday parties, graduations, and his own grandchildren have been stolen. Yet this man is the only dad they know. He was there at their births, and throughout their childhood. And what happened is neither their, nor even their mothers, fault.  There was no paternity fraud, because there was no intent to deceive. If Richard didnt know he was infertile theres no way his we could have done - there was no con, no scam, no cuckold duped into raising another mans children. At the absolute worst, she may have been uncertain - but as the affair was not discovered, and the marriage survived, she presumably took the view that mentioning it would have been horribly damaging for their children. Too late now. Its been mentioned all over the newspapers by an angry man trying to humiliate his ex-we and flush out her lover. Richard continues his obsession with parenthood equating to money, saying he believes the genetic parent has never paid a penny towards his sons.The latest news is that he is threatening to write a book which will be littered with clues as to the mans identity, which it appears he has suspicions of but is wary of stating as bluntly as he does his financial calculations.Would he sue the biological father,he could  We shall have to hold our breath, wont we.  In interviews Richard has said: I still think of them as my boys... and I miss them so much. Yet his actions are those of an angry sparrow whos found three cuckoos in his nest. You cannot love your children, but count them in pounds and pence. You cannot put their needs before yours, while exposing their very conception to national media scrutiny. You cannot possibly risk your child never speaking to you again,it can be avoided. But the fact Richard Mason got cashback on his hurt is not enough: now he wants to haul his family into the court of public opinion, where he can count on a gammon-faced jury to denounce a scheming female who somehow analysed his sperm years before the doctors did.

Courtney Wildin has revealed the symptoms that led to the shock diagnosis of leukaemia on December . The -year-old has recently come to the end of a course of chemotherapy his doctors hoped would cure the disease, reports Leicestershire Live. But now he was back in hospital on Sunday after his first leukaemia treatment failed to stop the disease and tests revealed the cancer was still present. Speaking shortly before ing to hospital, he said: “It’s been a shock and a strange five weeks. Every  minutes someone in the UK is diagnosed with a blood cancer, according to the non-profit advocacy group DKMS. This may be leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma. Blood cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in the UK. However, only one in three people with it - and in need of a transplant - will find a matching blood stem cell donor within their own family. Two in three need to look outside of this.Around  per cent of all donations are made through a method called peripheral blood stem cell . This is where blood is taken from one of the donor’s arms and a machine extracts the blood stem cells from it.The donor’s blood is then ed to them through their other arm. The outpatient procedure is typically completed in four to six hours. In  per cent of cases, donations are made through bone marrow collection. This is done while under general anaesthetic. To register as a potential donor, visit dkms.org.uk.Once youve received your home swab kit, it takes a few moments to swab. When you thenthe kit, you go on standby to help save a le. “They treated me with a lighter course of chemo which is usually all that’s required in cases like mine but on the th day of treatment they check the bone marrow and they’ve not seen a big enough decrease in the levels of leukaemia.” The footballer, who lives with his girlfriend Lauren Howkins in Ibstock, is now undergoing a more intensive course that will include seven days of chemotherapy followed by three more weeks in hospital recovering. He said: “It’s a harsher treatment but they’re  per cent sure that after this I’ll be cured and then back to playing football. It’s just a case of getting over the mental cloud of being in hospital all that time, which is never nice.” Courtney says the symptoms that led to his diagnosis in early December were odd.  He said: “We played against Tamworth on the Saturday and then on the Sunday I was celebrating my girlfriend’s and my brother’s birthdays and I’d been feeling a bit of fatigue and having night sweats. “On Monday I woke up with a swollen neck. It didn’t hurt but I was really odd so I had some tests done. “So in three days I went from playing football to being diagnosed with cancer – it was a massive shock.” He said the diagnosis had also been a shock for Lauren and his family. “It’s been dficult for my girlfriend,” he said. “But she’s been great. The whole family has been amazing. “My mum’s in Thurnby and my dad is in Birstall plus I’ve got two brothers and two sisters and with Ward  having open visiting hours they can come and see me while I’m in hospital. “The hope is that soon I’ll be back to playing football.” The defender, who joined Coalville last summer from Nantwich Town, has his parents and four siblings in the Leicester area and is looking forward to lots of visitors while he is on Ward  – the ward for young people with cancer – at the infirmary. He said: “Last time I was in hospital it was on an adult ward where there were people with a wide range of problems and that was a struggle. “But this time I’ll be on the young people’s ward where friends and family can visit all the time and I’ll be with other people my own age who are going through the same thing.”  He said that while the cancer itself hadn’t caused any pain, he was expecting more of the treatment’s unusual side-effects. He said: “The chemotherapy had a lot of weird side-effects that were strange – all sorts of things from sore teeth to constipation and trouble sleeping. “The doctors give you a whole list of things you might experience and it’s a crazy list.” When Courtney announced that he had been diagnosed with leukaemia there was an outpouring of support. The footballer, who is also a model, has been posting regular updates about his treatment on his Instagram page. Coalville Town chairman Glyn Rennocks said at the time of the diagnosis: Courtney has been a fantastic player both on and off the field since he joined us and we are all deeply shocked at the news. We will support him as best we can and we all wish him a speedy recovery.

Mum-of-three Lisa Fox also says strangers find it hard to tell her and teenage daughter Hollie apart. The -year-old from Whitley Bay, Newcastle Upon Tyne, believes that having children so young helped her to be a cool mum. And just eight weeks ago, she welcomed her first grandchild, Archie. I was always considered the cool mum and there has been a long-running joke with James friends that Im a bit of a MILF, the housewe admitted.  I often get mistaken for James girlfriend and I even got a phone call from a friend who believed she had seen him walking down the road with another woman when it was in fact me.

It was a shock at the time as I was on the pill but I had very supportive parents who helped me along the way.  I was determined to work and picked up a bar job, running home every night to make sure James was fed. Being a young mum meant I never really got used to having a social le or solely looking after myself so that having children just seemed to slot in. Lisa is also hoping to have children with new husband, Graeme, , but says it will be strange to think her babys nephew will be older that her grandchild, Archie.  She said: When I found out I was becoming a grandmother I felt a lot of people around me thought I would see it in a negative way, a misconception that I would feel I was getting old. But it was the completely opposite, having a baby in the family is just such a joy, it in no way made me feel asI was getting old. If anything being younger is an advantage and means I have more time to spend with Archie.  Also that I can run around and do a lot more activities with him. She added: We are very close as a family and with a smaller age gap, it means we have a lot of similar interests in music, films and fashion. The kids even took me along to a Coldplay concert.

Millionaire businessman Richard Mason, , was told by doctors he had been infertile since birth after being diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. DNA tests confirmed he had no biological link to his eldest son, now , and his -year-old twins. Richard, a co-founder of Moneysupermarket, believes the same man fathered the boys during a four-year affair with his ex-we Kate, . She admitted being unfaithful in , nine years after they separated, when he confronted her about the children’s paternity. It is not knownKate’s ex-lover knows he is the real father and she has refused to disclose his name.  Now Richard is planning to write a book about his traumatic ordeal and plans to litter it with clues as to the identity of his ex’s lover. He hopes it will lead to the mystery man being identied. Richard said it was: “Not least for the boys’ sake because they will want to know who their real father is, even , hopefully, they’ll always think of me as their dad.” Richard was told in  he had cystic fibrosis, a disease which mainly affects the lungs and causes men to be sterile. On receiving the shocking news he launched a legal bid to claw back some of Kate’s poundmillion orce settlement, as well as suing her for paternity fraud. She has since been ordered to pay pound, after a legal case that allowed her not to disclose the real father’s identity. Richard, now remarried to we Emma, , said the revelation about his sons had left him heartbroken. “You don’t know what’s real and what isn’t – it’s asI’m living in the Matrix,” he added. “In an instant I discovered I didn’t really have any children.” He claimed his ex-we “tricked’ him into thinking the boys were his. And he said: “After the orce, she constantly hounded me for more maintenance, even though I always complied with the Child Support Agency demands. “The biological father has never paid a penny as far as I know.” A possible clue to the identity of the man is that Kate became interested in Judaism, insisted all three children were given Jewish middle names and refused to have them christened. Despite winning his legal case against his ex, now living with a new partner in Uttoxeter, Staffs, two of his sons have cut off contact with him. He said: “I’m not their father, I know that, but I’m still their dad.

He added: “There has never been a orce financial settlement set aside in such emotive circumstances. “Normally it’s the husband brought back to court because he’s failed to disclose some of his income, but in this case it was the we, and paternity of the children was the issue.” "},{"url":null,"title":"levi bellfield detective reveals moment","story":"NewsLevi Bellfield detective reveals moment serial killer knew his sick game was upDetective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton said Bellfield also tells how Bellfield tried to hang himself after his arrest - by putting his head down the toiletShareCommentsByEmily RetterSenior Feature Writer:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video real-levi-bellfield-police-interview-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton stood just two feet from Levi Bellfield he saw pure hatred in the serial killer’s eyes – and relished every second. The detective stared back as he read the charges which would, he believed, land the triple murderer behind bars for le and saw Bellfield deflate. Sutton recalls: “He narrowed his eyes, he was absolutely still, staring me out. He hated me in that moment. “But you could also see that he had started to believe he had lost. “This was the man who later in court pretended to lick the microphone in the witness box like a lollipop, he was that arrogant. But in that moment he had nothing, no comeback at all.” Sutton says: “Never before had I so loved being hated. I loved the reason he hated me – we had taken a massive step to beating him.” The senior officer had led the team of detectives which, after a long and shypainstaking investigation, cracked the murders of Marsha McDonnell, , and Amelie Delagrange, . In doing so they first linked the “hammer killer” to the unsolved  murder of -year-old Milly Dowler. The probe is dramatised in ITV’s drama Manhunt, which started last night and stars Martin Clunes as Sutton. In dealing with Bellfield, Sutton saw the insecurities behind his bluster.   He recalls an extraordinary moment, hours after Bellfield’s arrest in November , when the desperate killer tried to hang himself in the most absurd fashion – with his head down the toilet. Sutton says: “In his cell he took the tape from his tracksuit, he put that round his neck and managed to get the end around the fixture for the flush. “But it was only ft off the ground, so to get it tight he had to stick his head down the loo. There was no way he was going to kill himself. I think it was a half-hearted, attention-seeking stunt.” Officers heard the attempt and managed to yank his head out. “I asked the doctorhe had Harpic poisoning – it got a few laughs, but not from Bellfield,” adds shySutton, wryly. Black humour was shysometimes the only way to offset the trauma in a case this dark.   The process leading to Bellfield shyeventually being charged for murder was painstaking. After his arrest, Bellfield could only be kept in custody thanks to charges ofshy assault and rape on three former partners – crimes which came to light during Sutton’s team’s investigation into his history of violence and abuse of women. It was only in March  that Sutton could stand before Bellfield and charge him with Amelie’s murder, and the attempted murder of another young woman, Kate Sheedy, , in May . The charge for Marsha’s murder came two months after that, and Bellfield, now , was convicted of all three charges at the Old Bailey in February . A conviction for Milly’s killing came three years later after Surrey police followed Sutton’s hunch in a separate probe. All these years on dad-of-two Sutton, , now retired and living in Suffolk, is reliving the landmark case of his career. He has written a book about the investigation, Manhunt: How I Brought Serial Killer Levi Bellfield To Justice, which is published this week to coincide with ITV’s three-parter, which is based on it and concludes tonight and tomorrow.  In the first episode we saw Sutton open his case when French student Amelie is found with fatal head injuries on Twickenham Green, South West London, on August , . The probe was meticulous – not least the police efforts to trace the killer’s vehicle. After a small white van was spotted at the murder scene and shyidentied as a Ford Courier made between  and , all , of the vehicles in the UK were probed. Former bouncer Bellfield’s name quickly came to the forefront when past partners come forward with revelations about his violence towards them. And it soon emerged he had owned a white van. In a similar fashion, police linked Bellfield to Marsha’s murder  months earlier, examining CCTV taken from a bus she was on and seeing a silver Vauxhall Corsa travel past as she got off.They worked out Bellfield owned one but had to rule out , similar shyvehicles. When that was narrowed down to  cars,  separate statements just left Bellfield. And they uncovered a link to the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, run over as she attempted to cross the road three months before Amelie’s death. Sutton found crucial CCTV footage of the hit-and-run in Isleworth, West London, but initially detectives viewed the wrong night. Six months later they watched the correct footage. It showed Bellfield’s car and could have led police to him and saved Amelie’s le – had they viewed it. Viewers of the series will see Sutton visit the shyDelagranges to tell them the truth and apologise for Scotland Yard.  “I was tearful talking to the Delagranges, I think I managed to mask it, I don’t know,” he recalls. “It was the most dficult thing I can remember having to do in the police. I spoke to a lot of recently bereaved people, but to explain they had been let down because of this stupid mistake. In some ways the way they reacted made it more emotional. “If they, as I feared, had got really annoyed and upset, I had prepared myself, but I hadn’t prepared for them being so utterly reasonable. “It was almost surreal, they were so calm and understanding. So dignied. I felt exactly the same emotions welling up when I watched that scene in the drama, it put me back there doing it.I cried again, it brought it all back and I remembered how emotional an experience that was.” Sutton is still in touch with the family, as he is with Marsha’s. Since writing the book he has also made contact with the Dowlers for the first time.  While investigating Bellfield, it dawned on him that the nightclub doorman had lived close to where Milly went missing near the railway station in Walton-on-Thames. Today, he says he can’t blame Surrey police for missing that link – Bellfield wasn’t on their radar. But in the book, Sutton’s frustration is clear when he describes the moment where he takes investigators his theory and proof Bellfield was on the scene – only to discover they had a lack of crucial CCTV evidence.“I knew they had messed up, they knew they had messed up, and now they knew I knew they had,” he writes. But the Dowlers are clearly grateful for his input. “The Dowlers have thanked me,” he admits. “It means a lot.” Sutton is unaffected personally by the trauma of the case but knows nothing can ever heal the victims’ families hurt. “I always had this great feeling of hopelessness, powerlessness, at the end of trials,” he says. “We had done the very best we could for them but it still wouldn’t bring the person back.” Manhunt: How I Brought Serial Killer Levi Bellfield To Justice by Colin Sutton, published by John Blake on Thursday, pound..

The man, known only as Stuart, allegedly emailed promoters at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in south London to moan that its monthly pop night turned into a gay evening. But in a stinging rebuke he was told that he wouldnt receive a refund and his money would instead be donated to the LGBT charity Stonewall in his honour. And he was advised to stay at home watching telly next year instead of partying in the most fabulously erse city on the planet.   Rob Holley, a promoter and DJ at Push The Button, a monthly pop night, shared Twitter screenshots of his email exchange with the man. After visiting the iconic venue, Stuart allegedly emailed on January  to complain about his experience at the well-known LGBT venue. In his first email, he complained: The event was a GBLT evening and this was not advertised in the website.   I attended the venue with my girlfriend and we ended up having to leave before midnight. In his initial response to Stuart, Mr Holley replied that the popular night has been running for eight years with the same LGBT-inclusive policy. He added: Push The Button is queer-run and welcomes respectful pop lovers of all genders and sexualities. Hope that helps. Wishing you a Happy New Year.  On the ticket page for the annual event, it also states: Push The Button is queer-run and welcomes respectful music lovers of all genders and sexualities.

He added: The venue was turned into a gay evening. I am not homophobic but this was not advertised on the website. I would like a full refund as our NYE was ruined.  Mr Holley responded: We often get people bellyaching over the lack of Kylie or why we chose not to play the new Loreen track, but in our  years weve not once had anyone complain that they felt uncomfortable because of their sexuality.

In his email, he said: I have no desire to see men kissing each other and neither did my partner.   He added: All I can say is that this is a NYE we will not be looking back on with happy memories. Mr Holley refused to refund the tickets but offered to donate pound in Stuarts honour instead. He added: If youre going out in Zone  of the most fabulously erse city on the planet, and the sight of two men kissing makes you and your girlfriend uncomfortable, Id suggest looking to spend NYE at home, in front of the telly.

David Kot was at a branch in Plymouth with his seven-year-old son on Thursday when he ordered the burger. He complained to staff that their burgers were cold and he was given a fresh one - but not his son who was really hungry had already eaten most of his cold burger. The -year-old said that staff responded happily and quickly but he noticed something was dferent when eating the burger, but couldnt work out why - and shortly after became unwell, reports Plymouth Live. He claims his replacement burger is to blame for the illness - and hes been put off McDonalds food for le.  The restaurant chain say they have not received any other food poisoning complaints from customers at the branch and are in the process of responding to David. He said: There was something wrong with it. It felt fresher and healthier but with less taste, cant really say more, simply did taste dferent neither worse or better, just dferent. After weve finished I was approached by a manager askingeverything was okay, Ive said it was and gone back home. One hour later Ive started feeling bad. I had a strange stomach sensation, first very similar to what you get after youve eaten too much food, but that wasnt getting any better with time, it was getting worse. I didnt eat anything since that unfortunate visit and Ive encountered constant diarrhoea which was with me all day and night on Friday and all Saturday morning. I literally spent the whole day on the toilet. My son, whose food wasnt replaced, feels alright and had no symptoms like mine. People say you should never complain. McDonalds has apologised for Davids experience and has said that its restaurants have not changed the recipe of this product, nor has the restaurant received any other complaints or contact from customers experiencing any similar issues.  The dad-of-one said that the Big Tasty burger was the only thing he had eaten that day, and that he has not eaten anything since. He said: I probably wouldnt connect it to McDonalds but since Christmas time, Ive spent all of my time with my son, wherever Ive gone, it was together with him. So we did eat the same things and been to the same places, mostly home. That was only signicant dference in our routine in that restaurant. Its put me off McDonalds food for good now. David said he feels disappointed by McDonalds service, and is convinced his illness is linked to the restaurant - though he has no solid evidence. In a letter to the fast-food chain, David said: Im very disappointed with this as Im a regular visitor of your restaurant since I was a kid and my whole family always enjoyed it.  Im convinced my condition has a lot to do with a visit in your restaurant on that day. I still havent recovered properly, havent left home since but I feel better enough to finally write this message. A spokesperson for McDonalds said: “The health and safety of our customers is our utmost priority and we adhere to strict food and quality standards. “We are sorry to hear that Mr Kot has recently been unwell and are aware that he has been in touch with our Customer Services team regarding his visit, and they are in the process of responding to him directly.

Comparing Meghans treatment to Dianas, Mr Burrell said: Meghan has married into the most traditional family in the country, the Royal Family. How is she going to cope  Princess Diana was brought up in a house that was as big as Buckingham Palace, and even she was lost. Buckingham Palace is a minefield for any person going in there for a first time. Who would want to be part of that family   Mr Burrell claimed Diana found it dficult to adjust as Buckingham Palace was not nice to her.He said: People set traps, they weren’t very kind to this young girl coming into this world. The documentary focuses on the alleged feud between Prince Harry and Prince Williams wives.But it also explores how the Duke of Sussex has allegedly changed since his marriage to the former actress. Prince Harry is completely beguiled and enthralled to his pregnant we, according to Lady Colin Campbell. He reportedly told royal staff in the run up to their wedding: What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.Speaking on the documentary, Lady Colin Campbell said: Everything I hear is that Harry is completely beguiled by Meghan and completely enthralled to her and has changed considerably. People do change when they get married.  And royal author Katie Nicholl said the real feud could be between the brothers. She explained how William was concerned Harrys relationship with Meghan was moving too fast, leading him to raise the issue with his younger sibling.But Harry was reportedly riled by Williams intervention which he saw as criticism of his bride-to-be.  Ms Nicholl said: They will joke about who hasn’t done the washing up or William will have a go at Harry for eating him out of house and home but actually a rt over his choice of bride is far more serious. William was quite concerned that the relationship had moved so quickly and being close to Harry, probably the only person close enough to say to Harry ‘this seems to be moving quickly, are you sure ’ And I think what was meant as well intended brotherly advice just riled Harry. Harry is hugely protective of Meghan, he saw that as criticism, he interpreted that as his brother not really being behind this marriage and I don’t think things have been quite right ever since. The couple announced their engagement in November  and wed in May. Meghan is expecting their first child in the spring.

Five pieces of debris were handed handed over to government officials at the Malaysian Ministry of Transports headquarters in Putrajaya in late November. Relatives of the MH victims presented the debris, which was found at Sandravinany, south Madagascar, about three months earlier. Amateur wreckage hunter Blaine Gibson was with the families. He has found more than half of the debris recovered so far. A key piece of debris handed over was a floor  which still had part of a label attached containing the letters and numbers WPPS. A report from the MH Safety Investigation Team said most of the new debris recovered was from an aircraft and the  belonged to a Boeing , most likely MH, The West Australian reported.Mr Gibson said: Don Thompson, one of the Independent Group investigating MHs disappearance, found the actual identication label for the Boeing . Mr Thompson was then able to work out the full suite of characters were BACWPPS, similar to a floorboard label found among the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH.  Malaysian authorities confirmed the analysis. Mr Gibson said that “locals tell me there are many more pieces of debris washed up but it needs to Malaysia to offer rewards.” Two extensive searches have not turned up the main body of wreckage. He believes the main body of the aircraft, which has yet to be found, is most likely just outside the search area.  Mr Gibson previously said the debris proves two things – that MH crashed violently and it almost certainly is in the Southern Indian Ocean. The Boeing  took off from Kuala Lumpur on March   bound for Beijing but disappeared mid-flight, in a mystery which has gripped the world. There were  passengers on board the aircraft at the time. The passage of time has helped to fuel countless conspiracy theories over what happened to the Boeing -ER and who or what was responsible.  The theories include the plane being hijacked remotely, a rogue pilot deliberately crashing the aircraft into the sea, and a fire breaking out in the cargo hold. No evidence has been presented by investigators to support any of the theories. One amateur sleuth has even claimed that Google Maps images show parts of the doomed aircraft in a jungle in Cambodia. Last year, MHs final moments were recreated in a documentary showing it plunging into the sea in a terrying death spiral after running out of fuel. The National Geographic documentary Drain The Oceans claimed the plane crashed into the water after flying in the wrong direction over the Indian Ocean for six hours.

Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, , claimed Thai officials seized her passport while she waited for an onward flight. She fled her family on a trip to Kuwait and had been trying to reach Australia to seek asylum after renouncing Islam. But she was detained after a relative reported her for travelling without a maleand was being held at an airport hotel yesterday. Qunun said she had suffered abuse and violence from her family, including being locked in a room for six months for cutting her hair. Describing herself as scared and losing hope, she said she expected to be repatriated to Kuwait then Saudi Arabia today.  The Saudi Foreign Ministry denied her allegations that its embassy had confiscated her passport, saying in a tweet she was stopped at the airport for violating Thai immigration laws. Qunun posted a video to Twitter on Monday of her barricading her hotel door with a table and a mattress. A Thai immigration official confirmed Qunun was still in the hotel room on Monday morning. Another airport official confirmed the Kuwait Airways flight she was scheduled to be on had left. Qunun said she fled Kuwait while her family was visiting the Gulf country and had planned to travel from Thailand to Australia to seek asylum. She said she was detained after leaving her plane in Bangkok and told she would be sent back to Kuwait.  My brothers and family and the Saudi embassy will be waiting for me in Kuwait, Qunun said by text and voice message from the hotel late on Sunday. They will kill me. My le is in danger. My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things. Asked why she was seeking refuge in Australia, she said: Physical, emotional and verbal abuse and being imprisoned inside the house for months. They threaten to kill me and prevent me from continuing my education. They wont let me drive or travel. I am oppressed. I love le and work and I am very ambitious but my family is preventing me from living. Her family could not immediately be reached for comment.  In her initial social media pleas, Qunun said her family was powerful in Saudi society but she did not identy them. Saudi culture and ship policy requires women to have permission from a male relative to work, travel, marry, and even get some medical treatment. Thai immigration authorities denied Qununs allegations they were acting at the behest of the Saudi government, saying she was refused entry because she did not have the proper documents for a visa on arrival. The Saudi Foreign Ministry said on its official Twitter account: She was stopped by the airport authorities for violating the laws. Her passport was not impounded by the Saudi embassy.  New York-based Human Rights Watch said Thailand should not send Qunun back to her family because she says she faces danger. Thai authorities should immediately halt any deportation, and either allow her to continue her travel to Australia or permit her to remain in Thailand to seek protection as a refugee, Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. Qunun said she had obtained an Australian visa and booked a flight. She said she planned to spend a few days in Thailand so she would not spark suspicion when she left Kuwait. When I landed at the airport, someone came and said he would process thevisa but he took my passport. He came back with what seemed to be airport security and said that my parents objected and said I mustto Saudi Arabia via Kuwait Airways, she said. She said she believed she was stopped after her family appealed to Kuwait Airways.  A spokesman for Kuwait Airways said he had no information about the case. Thai immigration chief Surachate Hakparn said he had had no contact with Saudi officials or Thailands foreign minister before Qununs arrival. He said she was denied entry because she did not have a paidticket or hotel reservation. She was over-exaggerating...she fled her family from Saudi Arabia and arrived in Thailand but she didnt have necessary documents to enter. Thai immigration had to deny her entry, he said, describing such cases as standard procedure. In April , Saudi national Dina Ali Lasloom, , was held in Manilla airport while trying to flee a forced marriage. She was forcibly taken back to Saudi Arabia by her uncles and never heard from again.

directors latest movie","story":"A north-east film director whose new movie about Laurel and Hardy is about to hit cinemas has told how he can trace his affection for the comedy legends back to his north-east primary school.Jon S Baird’s movie Stan  Ollie opens on Friday and has already won rave reviews from critics.The biopic charts the Hollywood duo as they set out on a iety hall tour of Britain in .Jon, , says he has had a love of the comedy duo since he was a child in Peterhead.Jon said: “I got into them as a kid watching them on TV.“In fact, there’s a picture of me dressed as Stan Laurel aged eight at the Meethill Primary fancy dress and a mate of mine, Steven Morgan, dressed as Oliver.“There was certainly an interest way, way back. They’ve always been heroes of mine and an influence on my comedy taste through the years.”Since leaving Peterhead to attend university, Dons fanatic Jon has carved out an acclaimed career, writing and directing the films Cass in  and Filth in , as well as helming episodes of TV shows from the likes of Martin Scorsese and Danny Boyle.Stan  Ollie is his biggest budget film to date and stars Steve Coogan and John C Reilly as the iconic funnymen.But Jon says a personal health emergency almost made the production grind to a halt – even before cameras started rolling.“I got appendicitis a couple of days before we started shooting,” he said.“I got rushed into hospital but managed to recuperate in a week and get back up and running. It was quite unexpected.”Another added complication for the film schedule – which took place at theatres around the country – was the marathon make-up sessions to turn John C Reilly into Oliver Hardy.Jon said: “He was in the chair for four hours for make-up and costume, so that eats into some of your shooting days. It was such a massive job. Plus there was the hour at the end of the day taking it off.”The director joined the project after being sent the script for Stan  Ollie by writer Jeff Pope, who in  earned an Oscar nomination penning the film Philomena with Steve Coogan.“I took it on because it was completely dferent to what I’d done before,” said Jon.“It was a conscious decision to go in a dferent direction because I didn’t want to be typecast as the guy who only made the gritty darker movies. This was as far away from that as you could hope for.”An impromptu impersonation of Stan Laurel during dinner with Steve Coogan convinced Jon the Alan Partridge star was the man for the role.Jon said: “Without any warning Steve dropped his napkin on the floor and went down to pick it up then purposefully bashed his head on the table on the way up.“He just went into Stan Laurel without any warning at all. It was incredible – a real tingle up the spine moment.”Although part of the film is set during Laurel and Hardy’s heyday in the s, the bulk of it is set in , at a time when their star power had faded.Jon – who was back in the north-east over Christmas and was at Pittodrie to watch the Dons’ dramatic Boxing Day clash with Celtic – said: “I don’t think they were best of friends.“Ollie had hobbies outside of work and Stan was a pure workaholic.“It was only when they started doing their theatre tours and they were forced together at the end of their careers because they had no money, that they became very close friends.“The film really is a love story about these two friends who realise at the end of their careers and end of their lives what is really important in le.“It’s a simple tale – a love story really.”"},{"url":null,"title":"how to recycle your christmas tree in aberdeen1","story":"People in Aberdeen are being reminded to recycle their Christmas trees.Residents can recycle their real Christmas trees by taking them to the nearest waste and recycling centre.For those with wheelie bins, the council will collect the trees on the usual brown bin collection day until January .The authority has asked the public to put them in the bin and close the lid.Households using communal bins are asked to leave the trees beside it and ensure the bin is accessible for the collection crews.The trees will be collected between Thursday and Monday for those living on or south of Beach Bouled, Justice Street, Castlegate, Union Street, Albyn Place, Queen’s Road and Skene Road.For people living north of these streets, the trees will be collected between January  and January .

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13808455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_shr_ayp_281218weight2.jpg","title":"woman lost weight after deciding","story":"NewsWoman lost weight after deciding to do something before it was out of controlThe -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier.ShareByStephen Houston:,  JAN NewsDeborah Biggar \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHer name is a headline writer’s dream. For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"borders-top-cop-is-set-to-retire","story":"POLICE Scotlands Area Commander for the Borders, Andy McLean, is about to retire.Having joined Lothian and Borders Police in Galashiels in , Chief Inspector McLean has served in ious unorm roles over the past three decades.In his tenure, he has worked within Response and Community Policing, Road Policing and Public Order roles.Speaking ahead of his retirement Andy told us: \"It has been my absolute honour and privilege to have worked for this organisation, and for Lothian and Borders Police beforehand.\"Putting on the unorm always gave me a tremendous sense of pride and while it will be strange to no longer do this each day, I am looking forward to the next chapter and what it will involve.\"While Ive enjoyed all of my roles, being able to serve as Local Area Commander for the Borders is undoubtedly a career highlight and I am extremely grateful to all of the officers and staff Ive worked with and who have helped make our area such a wonderful place to live.\"Id also like to extend my sincerest thanks to the ious partner organisations, whom we work closely with on a daily basis.

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

The entire ScotRail Alliance ndash a partnership between ScotRail and Network Rail Scotland ndash is focused on delivering that and we will give you a better service.Protesters gathered outside Glasgow Central Station on Monday morning to call for action to be taken against the rail operator.Last month, the Scottish Government told ScotRail to submit a plan to address falling performance levels.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard is calling for public ownership of railways Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard attended the protest and backed calls from unions for the railway franchise to be removed from Dutch operator Abellio and ed to public ownership.His party criticised the compensation as a ldquogimmick which is ldquojust not good enough and said a real compensatory move would have been to back their call for a fare freeze.Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Jamie Greene said the offer would not adequately compensate passengers for the ldquochaos they experienced, adding: ldquoWhat they want is real action taken to ensure that they have an effective and reliable train service that they can rely on, not cheap offers to buy them off.Mr Leonard urged the Scottish Government to use the break clause in the ScotRail franchise to take the railway into public ownership.ldquoWersquove seen in the last weeks fares going up, so many of the commuters coming into Glasgow this morning are paying extra for a service which is worse and we think there is huge support for aof ScotRail into public ownership, he said.ldquoIt would mean that every single penny that passengers pay would be reinvested in the railway instead of the current situation where part of that goes back to pay shareholder idends in Holland.He added that since publicly-run Network Rail is operated as part of the ScotRail Alliance there was a ldquostrong case for the entire rail network in Scotland to become a publicly-owned and run integrated service.Liz Warren-Corney of the TSSA said that Transport Secretary Michael Matheson would have to leave his post for this to happen as she believes he is ldquoideologically in favour of privatisation unlike her view of his predecessor Humza Yousaf.QuestionedMr Matheson would have to go to achieve change, she said: ldquoYes. I donrsquot think that would be a bad thing.ldquoThe job of Transport Secretary is to stand up for passengers and when it comes to ScotRail, he has done anything but.She added: ldquoI think politicians need to bow to the will of the public and ultimatelythey see this is what the public want then, yes, they will go that way.ldquoWe certainly saw that Humza Yousaf was very much open to the idea of bringing ScotRail into public ownership.ldquoUnfortunately, hersquos gone and Matheson has now bottled it, frankly, and clearly will do anything he can to prop up Abelliorsquos failing operation of ScotRail.The Scottish Government has called on the UK Government to devolve all matters involving rail A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoRail remains a reserved matter under the Scotland Act.ldquoUntil this changes, we cannot consider the full range of options for running the railways in Scotland in a way which best suits our passengers, freight providers and communities.ldquoThat is why we are yet again calling on the UK Government, through its rail review, to devolve all rail matters to the Scottish Ministers. Anyone with a genuine interest in improving our railways should get behind this.ldquoUnique in the UK, the Scottish Government has secured powers to accept bids for future rail franchises in Scotland from public sector organisations through the Scotland Act .ldquoThis was after repeatedly being denied that right by successive Labour and Conservative governments.An Abellio spokesman said: ldquoAbelliorsquos focus is on delivering the existing franchise to the highest possible standards, working hard to put in place a railway that better connects passengers, businesses, and communities across Scotland..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: ScotRail issue apology for  uunacceptable u service amid cancellations"},{"url":null,"title":"playground-project-shortlisted-for-cash-boost","story":"A PROJECT to upgrade a Galashiels playground has secured a spot in the final round of a national competition.lsquoGlendinning Play For Allrsquo has reached the last round of the Aviva Community Fund competition and is in the running to receive a cash boost of up to pound,.The project to purchase new equipment for the playground at Glendinning Terrace Primary School got , public votes during the first round of the competition in November.This was enough to bag them a pound prize and a spot on the shortlist, which could see them awarded up to pound,.The project was one of only  of the  projects in the lsquoHealth and Wellbeingrsquo category to win a spot in the next round, which will see a judging  award the funds.The final winners are due to be announced at the end of the month.The Aviva Community Fund competition offers projects from across the UK the chance to get funding for important community causes.lsquoGlendinning Play For Allrsquo want to provide access to play equipment for the Glendinning community.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

We expect week-on-week improvement through January and February to get your service back to normal levels.ldquoWe know you deserve better. The entire ScotRail Alliance ndash a partnership between ScotRail and Network Rail Scotland ndash is focused on delivering that and we will give you a better service.Protesters gathered outside Glasgow Central Station on Monday morning to call for action to be taken against the rail operator.Last month, the Scottish Government told ScotRail to submit a plan to address falling performance levels.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard attended the protest and backed calls from unions for the railway franchise to be removed from Dutch operator Abellio and ed to public ownership.His party criticised the compensation as a ldquogimmick which is ldquojust not good enough and said a real compensatory move would have been to back their call for a fare freeze.Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Jamie Greene said the offer would not adequately compensate passengers for the ldquochaos they experienced, adding: ldquoWhat they want is real action taken to ensure that they have an effective and reliable train service that they can rely on, not cheap offers to buy them off.Mr Leonard urged the Scottish Government to use the break clause in the ScotRail franchise to take the railway into public ownership.ldquoWersquove seen in the last weeks fares going up, so many of the commuters coming into Glasgow this morning are paying extra for a service which is worse and we think there is huge support for aof ScotRail into public ownership, he said.ldquoIt would mean that every single penny that passengers pay would be reinvested in the railway instead of the current situation where part of that goes back to pay shareholder idends in Holland.He added that since publicly-run Network Rail is operated as part of the ScotRail Alliance there was a ldquostrong case for the entire rail network in Scotland to become a publicly-owned and run integrated service.Liz Warren-Corney of the TSSA said that Transport Secretary Michael Matheson would have to leave his post for this to happen as she believes he is ldquoideologically in favour of privatisation unlike her view of his predecessor Humza Yousaf.QuestionedMr Matheson would have to go to achieve change, she said: ldquoYes. I donrsquot think that would be a bad thing.ldquoThe job of Transport Secretary is to stand up for passengers and when it comes to ScotRail, he has done anything but.She added: ldquoI think politicians need to bow to the will of the public and ultimatelythey see this is what the public want then, yes, they will go that way.ldquoWe certainly saw that Humza Yousaf was very much open to the idea of bringing ScotRail into public ownership.ldquoUnfortunately, hersquos gone and Matheson has now bottled it, frankly, and clearly will do anything he can to prop up Abelliorsquos failing operation of ScotRail.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoRail remains a reserved matter under the Scotland Act.ldquoUntil this changes, we cannot consider the full range of options for running the railways in Scotland in a way which best suits our passengers, freight providers and communities.ldquoThat is why we are yet again calling on the UK Government, through its rail review, to devolve all rail matters to the Scottish Ministers. Anyone with a genuine interest in improving our railways should get behind this.ldquoUnique in the UK, the Scottish Government has secured powers to accept bids for future rail franchises in Scotland from public sector organisations through the Scotland Act .ldquoThis was after repeatedly being denied that right by successive Labour and Conservative governments.An Abellio spokesman said: ldquoAbelliorsquos focus is on delivering the existing franchise to the highest possible standards, working hard to put in place a railway that better connects passengers, businesses, and communities across Scotland."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/9259002.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"harry-and-meghan-head-to-merseyside-for-first-engagement-of-2019","story":"Harry and Meghan will travel to the Wirral on Monday January  to see a number of organisations which support and empower groups within the local community.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will visit Birkenhead on Monday th January.Their Royal Highnesses will visit a number of local organisations that support and empower groups within the local community, including @TomorrowsWomen and @TheHiveYZ. pic hCQuKnmdash Kensington PalaceJanuary , The duke and duchess, who are expecting their first child in the spring, willvisit Tomorrowrsquos Women Wirral, an organisation that supports women in vulnerable circumstances.It was set up in  to support women on their release from prison, and now offers a range of training courses and workshops for more than , local women, including support groups around mental health issues, domestic abuse and addiction.Harry and Meghan will hear from some of thewomen about their experiences.The couple will also visit the Hive, Wirral Youth Zone, created by thecharity OnSide Youth Zones, which is developing st century youth facilities across the UK.The Hive aims to provide a safe environment for young people to help them build key skills and raise their aspirations and confidence.The duke and duchess will also meet members of the public in Hamilton Square when they view a new sculpture marking the th anniversary of the death of Birkenhead war poet Wilfred Owen."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9239022.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"i-cant-wait-to-get-back-to-glasgow-flashback-to-when-rising-star-richard-madden-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"The -year-old, from Elderslie, saw off competition from Ozarkrsquos Jason Bateman, Homecomingrsquos Stephen James, Posersquos Billy Porter and Welsh star Matthew Rhys, who was recognised for his part in The Americans.Speaking after accepting the honour on stage at the ceremony in Los Angeles, Madden said the award was a ldquowake-up call that will give him more self-confidence.Here, we look back to  when the rising actor spoke to the Evening Times about his role as Romeo in a UK tour of Shakespearersquos classic:Wherefore art thou Romeo  Actually, hes from Elderslie!A YOUNG Scots actor is to play one of the most famous lovers in history as part of a prestigious UK tour.Richard Madden, , has been cast as Romeo in a new production of Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet.The outdoor performance will be a homecoming celebration for Richard, as the second date on the -venue tour is Glasgow.Richard is from Elderslie, near Paisley but lives in Cowcaddens, Glasgow, while studying at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.Richard, who is now rehearsing in London, said: \"I have dreamed of playing this part - its amazing.\"Its such a hard thing to take on because Romeos so messed-up and so young - I never thought Id get to play him without even graduating.\"Im still trying to find my place as an actor and Romeo is trying to find his place in the world.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"Today   s feminist activists are wrong to exclude men","story":"Anne Widdicombe might have dismissed it as trivial and whingeing ndash and some #MeTooers undoubtedly deserve that label ndash but the culture of sexual harassment and abuse it calls out is far from unimportant. Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails. Since wersquore in it all together, thatrsquos also how we should sort things out."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-as-the-brexit-clock-runs-out-labour-cant-afford-to-sit-on-its-hands-a-moment-longer","story":"There is a body of opinion in the Labour party, and not a million miles from the leaders office, that the best option would be for Labour to sit on its hands. Not vote. Let the Tories squirm. Not our problem, mate.Its not Jeremys fault that the PM came back from Brussels with a broken-backed deal that is, in Corbyns words, ldquothe worst of all worlds. If hed been allowed to do the dealing: why, hersquod surely have come back with a joyous, jobs first Brexit. The Corbynator wouldve tough-talked Brussels into agreeing a bespoke customs union, plus privileged access to the European Single Market without any obligation to accept freedom of movement or state aid rules. Job done. If only the Tories would call that election so Jeremy could make it happen!Except of course therell be no General Election, and eventhere was, Jeremy Corbyn has about as much chance of finding a better deal in Brussels as the police have in finding drones over Gatwick, or Chris Grayling a channel ferry operator that actually has ferries. Of course, no-one is allowed to say this in the presence of the Dear Leader. So Labour ministers and MPs bite their ragged lips and perpetuate the most cynical political hood since Donald Trump promised to make Mexico pay for the border wall.And given their supine behaviour thus far, it is probable that many Labour MPs would allow themselves to be whipped into abstaining on the only meaningful vote on Brexit. After all, they abstained last year on the motion to allow parliament to consider the EEA ldquoNorway option, even though thats the one alternative to Mays deal that Brussels might accept. Their latest abstention may not be on the first outing of the ldquomeaningfulvote, scheduled for next week. May is expected to lose that , and to bring her final, final, amended deal back to the Commons, probably in February, hoping that MPs will fall into line as the Article  clock runs out. Thats when Labour will decide the fate of the nation.And lets be absolutely clear: abstaining on Brexit, the most important issue facing the UK since the Second World War, would not just be an abdication of opposition ndash it would be a betrayal, a craven capitulation, for which Labour would never be forgiven. Abstention would mean handing the future of the UK to the hardline Brexiteers who have been holding May and country to ransom for the last two years, despite representing a small minority in parliament. At the very least, Corbyn would be conniving in saving Theresa Mays discredited Withdrawal Deal, thus condemning the UK to a ldquobotched Brexit, which he described in November as ldquoan act of national self-harm.The press would have a field day with headlines about ldquoLabours Meaning-less Vote over pictures of a bewildered-looking Corbyn in Parliament as Theresa May berates him for having no policy on Brexit after two-and-a-half years of attacking the Governments. ldquoWhat is Labour for , commentators would ask, questioning Corbyns reason, leadership and his fitness to govern. But that would be nothing compared to the comments in Labour itself.Abstention would risk splitting the party. The vast majority of Labour members oppose Brexit and want a referendum. This is an issue, uniquely, which unites the young left activists of Momentum with the old right Blairites of what used to be called New Labour. There would be mass resignations, with young members burning their party cards. Rebel Labour MPs, like Chuka Umunna, would likely join with SNP, Liberal Democrats and Tory remainers, creating a new political coalition. The party could be split for years, decades even ndash like Ramsay MacDonaldrsquos Labour after .So, why is Corbyn even contemplating this ruinous route  The answer is partly his own ingrained euroscepticism. He says he voted Remain in , but ever since the s he has opposed the free market economics that underpin the  Treaty of Rome that founded the EEC. Corbyn thinks the rules of the single market could make British socialism impossible. ldquoI dont want to be told by someone , hes said, ldquothat we cant use state aid to develop industry in this country. This is disputed by Labour supporters of the EU, but it is not in doubt that Brussels generally regards Government subsidies as anti-competitive.The other reason is electoral. Most of Labourrsquos General Election target seats are pro-leave constituencies. So, while the opinion polls may indicate that a majority of voters would now vote Remain, Labour could still lose the next General Electionits seen to block Brexit. Again, this electoral calculation is disputed. But clearly Corbyn is trying to keep his pro-European party on side while not alienating anti-European voters. Riding two horses is notoriously dficult owing to the tendency to fall off both of them.But perhaps the main reason Corbyn might be tempted by abstention is the old political adage, attributed to Napoleon: ldquoNever interrupt your enemy while he is making a mistake. Brexit will be a disaster for the Tories from day one, and then get steadily worse. So, why get in her way  Let Theresa May or her successor, implement her useless Withdrawal Deal, leave the EU as planned, and then allow Labour to benefit from the public backlash. Corbyn will have his general election without ever having to have a coherent policy on Brexit, which by then will anyway be a done deal.This is a superficially attractive strategy but ultimately ruinous for Labour. First of all, this is not a battle, but a war. You DO interrupt your enemyheis about to run all over you. By abstaining, and effectively allowing Mayrsquos deal to go ahead, Labour will be fatally implicated in the subsequent disaster. The public wont forgive Corbyn for failing to seize the only opportunity to prevent Brexit. Its unlikely he would survive the backlash that will afflict our entire political class .Remain supporters in Labour hope that reason will prevail and that Corbyn will not succumb to abstentionism. That he will ldquopivot to a Peoples Vote after May loses the meaningful vote next week. But I dont think this is going to happen by itself ndash he is too wedded to keeping his head down. Anyway, Corbyns instincts are clear from his candid remarks over Christmas that, even after a General Election, he would still carry Brexit through.However, the Labour leader is supposed to believe in party democracy ndash hes been arguing for it from the backbenches for most of his career. It is now time for Labours unsilent majority to take control. Either through a special conference, demonstrations or petitions, they must show Corbyn that they will not accept Labour voting for Brexit by pretending to vote for nothing at all. The meaningful vote must mean something."},{"url":null,"title":"last-waltz-for-music-tuition-in-scottish-schools","story":"THE performance of the day came from Linlithgow Academy pupil Alice Ferguson, although it was her vocal chords rather than her trumpet that sounded the last post for equality of access to school music tuition.Appearing before the Scottish Parliaments education committee to talk about the impact of rising charges for tuition, Alice said some of her friends had given up playing because they could no longer afford the higher fees introduced by West Lothian Council.\"It is the privileged that are getting to do music now which is going back to Victorian times where only the elite get to do music,\" she said.\"A lot of my friends have now dropped out of music because they cannot afford it. Why should somebody be denied the opportunity to play an instrument because they cannot afford it \"Alice, a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament for Linlithgow, is in good company. Earlier this year, Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti hit out over rises in tuition fees across the UK, signing a joint letter with other musicians calling for all primary pupils to be taught an instrument at no cost.Mick Cooke, a former member of the indie band Belle  Sebastian, also spoke out saying he and other musicians such as KT Tunstall, Ricky Ross and Eddi Reader had all benefitted from free lessons.The impact of the rising charges in West Lothian has been signicant. Since officials introduced fees of pound, more than , pupils have dropped out. David Dodds, executive councillor for education in West Lothian, admitted reductions are more pronounced in poorer areas.Other councils that have either raised charges or introduced them for the first time have also flagged the disproportionate impact on poorer families.Worryingly, Fe Council said more than  pupils from poorer families who were entitled to free tuition under a concessionary scheme had discontinued simply because of the climate of uncertainty the introduction of higher fees had created.The issue of access to music tuition is one that will resonate with families across Scotland, regardless of their financial background.More than a third of Scotlandrsquos  councils either increased charges or introduced them for the first time in the   school year. Currently  local authorities charge for instrumental music tuition, with fees for group lessons ranging from pound to pound.In order to offset hardship for poorer families, councils have introduced concessionary schemes, but the evidence suggests these do not always have the desired impact. Families who just miss the threshold can be particularly disadvantaged.Figures published before the impact of the latest increases showed the number of pupils accessing instrumental music tuition across Scotland fell from , in   to , in  .It is not just increasing charges which are causing concern, with a fall in the number of music instructors over the past few years, particularly those working full-time. The Educational Institute of Scotlandteaching union said there are currently just  dedicated tutors serving primary and secondary schools compared to , in .The perfect storm of declining music tutors and rising charges means providing instrumental music lessons to all interested pupils is proving impossible.The Improvement Service, a support organisation for local government, found only five councils currently able to provide provision for all interested pupils, with the rest operating unpopular selection processes and waiting lists.A recent survey by parent body Connect highlighted the trend with one family responding: \"The current system of testing for aptitude in P without warning favours young people whose parents have already invested in music lessons. Anecdotally, those in my sonrsquos year who have passed the test are all already receiving private music tuition.\"Experts believe the long term impact of the squeeze will create a situation where only the wealthy will be able to develop their talents to play at the highest level. Andrew Dickie from the Scottish Association for Music Education has warned membership of the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland is already \"almost exclusively\" from private schools.Tudor Morris, director of the Edinburgh Music School, said: ldquoTalent is not handed out by postcode. The cultural history of Scotland has been permanently enriched by the creative genius of iniduals from less advantaged backgrounds.\"Morris argues another consequence of charging is that certain instruments, such as the double bass, bassoon, oboe, French horn and viola, will become \"rare or even extinct as pupils choose cheaper instruments or ones more commonly taught in school such as acoustic guitar.Kenny Christie, chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, said the situation was the worst he had ever seen. \"As the network comes into its st year it would be fair to say that never before has the concern and fear for the future of instrumental music education been so profound.\"Campaigners estimate it would cost about pound million per year to ensure all children have a right to instrumental lessons, but say the benefits make the investment worthwhile economically and educationallyThe Such benefits are well-researched. Susan Hallam from the Institute of Education at University College London identied wider improvements benefits in language and literacy skills, numeracy, intellectual development, general attainment, creativity and personal and social development.In a letter to the education committee last year, the Music Education Partnership Group said: \"The practice of music develops transferable skills such as team working, resilience, discipline, performing, problem-solving, evaluating, abstract thinking, physical and fine motor coordination.\"So why is it happening  The root of the problem is the fact instrumental music is a discretionary service provided by local authorities that is separate to the core music curriculum taught within the classroom.With council budgets increasingly coming under pressure in the era of austerity, cuts to services which are not a statutory responsibility naturally come under scrutiny.The extent of the financial dficulties in West Lothian which led to the increase in fees were explained to Holyroods Education Committee by Dodds, who said an original budget of pound, had been almost halved to pound,. \"Instrumental music tuition, like many other areas, faces huge problems due to the underfunding of local government,\" he said.Willie Wilson, from Perth and Kinross, said the council had introduced charges many years ago, but after a six-year freeze introduced a % increase last year.\"We thought long and hard before we put the charges up. We were faced with the traditional rock and a hard place. Either to diminish the service in some way or to maintain the service and increase the charges,\" he said.So what are the alternatives  One of the recommendations of the Scottish Government-backed Instrumental Music Group from  was that, in a challenging financial climate, councils should consider economies of scale such as collaborating with community groups, other local authorities and national music bodies in the provision of tuition and the purchase, repair and sharing of instruments.There have also been calls for government funding to be ringfenced - or to have grant conditions attached to it - to ensure local authorities spend it on what was intended.Others have suggested a national service removed from council control. A spokesman for the independent St Marys Music School in Edinburgh, said: \"It is simply unacceptable for children to be excluded from the study of music on grounds of cost due to a postcode lottery. It never has been sensible, reasonable or pragmatic to entrust music education to local authorities who have other funding allocations to consider.\"Other attempts to preserve tuition include Highland Councilrsquos transferral of the service from its education department to a charitable armrsquosorganisation, High Le Highland, which has resulted in an increase in participation.The Western Isles has been able to provide instrumental music tuition for all interested pupils partly because of its innovative use of technology, with e-lessons provided through a school video conferencing system.In order to kickstart an interest in music, the Scottish Government currently funds the Youth Music Initiativewhich provides pound.m of funding to local authorities so every pupil in Scotland is offered a year of free music tuition by the time they leave primary school.The   YMI annual plan states it had reached an estimated , young people in  , but there are concerns the project will create an interest in music that cannot be fully explored, due to the cost of continuing tuition.Kirk Richardson, convener of the Instrumental Music Teachersrsquo Network, run by the EIS, said the initiative gave little more than a ldquobrief taster.\"This initiative is no substitute for properly resourced local authority music services. If a child shows interest and ability, there must be an appropriately resourced instrumental music service to enable the pupil to continue developing their talent,\" he said.Whatever solutions may help save the service, there is an underlying concern about a \"disparity of esteem\" between classroom music teaching and instrumental teaching.As part of its inquiry into rising costs, education committee MSPs held focus groups with students from the Royal Conservatoire which highlighted the worrying trend. Examples included a tutor being asked to hold group string sessions in a school bathroom.A report on the focus group said: \"Students generally felt instrumental tutors are being provided with less quality time to spend with pupils. It was suggested that a lack of pupils in inidual schools resulted in tutors being asked to travel between schools in a local authority in a single day on a very tight timetable, which led to both tutors and pupils feeling rushed.\"It was reported that this change to working patterns has also led to tutors feeling less embedded in particular schools, and therefore feeling less like part of the department.\"Students called for music tuition to be viewed in partnership with classroom teaching because it was \"unrealistic\" to expect teachers alone to get students to the level required to achieve qualications.\"Without tuition the classroom teacher would need to be able to play all of the instruments played by the class they were teaching,\" the report said.Alastair Orr, a brass instrumental teacher in the Stirling area, called for the work of instrumental and vocal teachers in Scotlands schools to be recognised as fundamental, not only to music education, but more widely to the cultural and creative character of the country.\"The time has long passed for instrumental and vocal tuition to be regarded as some form of casual add-on to the daily timetable. There is a clear argument, highlighted by pupils, parents and others, for instrumental tuition to enjoy parity of esteem with every other subject being taught in schools,\" he said."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-tory-stephen-kerr-xenophobic-colleagues-have-more-in-common-with-the-snp-than-unionism","story":"Stephen Kerr, who will be voting for the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to leave the EU, said party hardliners displayed the same sort of ldquoromanticised and ldquosometimes xenophobic attitudes as some Scottish nationalists.He also said that Scottish and English nationalists suffered from ldquoarrogance and a ldquodetachment from reality.An SNP spokesperson said: ldquoThe two futures facing the people of Scotland could not be more dferent ndash a Tory Westminster government which is determined to cut the UK off from the world ndash or the positive, outward-looking Scotland which the SNP is proud to endorse, and which Scotlandrsquos economy badly needs.\"It is for Stephen Kerr to explain why he continues to endorse the former over the latter.Theresa Mayrsquos plan to take the UK out of the European Union is facing defeat this month after a backlash by Tory MPs showed no sign of abating.Her right-wing colleagues, who failed to topple her as Prime Minister last month, loathe the draft agreement she struck with EU negotiators and are relaxed about a no-deal departure.Although her plan is expected to be defeated heavily, May has received strong, but not unanimous, support from her contingent of Scottish Tory MPs.Kerr, who was elected to serve the Stirling constituency in , voted for Brexit but has said he backs Mayrsquos draft agreement.Speaking to The Herald on Sunday, he is also firmly against a no-deal exit and believes crashing out could ldquopour petrol on the embers of nationalism in Scotland.He also had strong words for MP colleagues who he believes are motivated by nationalism:ldquoMy concern about the attitude of some of my English Conservative colleagues is that they have more in common with the SNP, and their attitudes, than sometimes I think they have with conservatism and unionism.ldquoThey have a very similar, black and white, sometimes romanticised, sometimes xenophobic attitude towards other people.He continued: ldquoScottish nationalism, like all nationalism, is not positive in my eyes.

The Morandi Bridge fell in to a river in August, killing  people and crippling the local economy. Italy has been engulfed by a scandal over under-maintenance every since.The RAC Foundation is not saying that there are similarly dangerous structures on Scottish or UK highways. But it saiddid say the maintenance backlog did include checks on post-tensioned or PT bridges using similar technology to the Morandi.These PT bridges require intrusive inspections that can cost pound,. Almost a third of the  PT bridges managed by Britainrsquos councils have not had this test carried out in the last  years, despite requiring it.The latest study also found that some , bridges in the worst condition have been categorised as ldquosubstandard, meaning they are unable to carry the heaviest vehicles. That includes  bridges in Scotland.RAC Foundationrsquos Mr Gooding stressed that many of the these structures were old stone rural bridges, but weight restrictions came with costs.He said: ldquoAncient bridges on rural back roads might not be the highest priority for repair, but the risk we run is that substandard structures on some roads result in heavier vehicles having to make y detours.Bill Barker, secretary of SCOTS, the body that represents council road engineers, stressed that substandard bridges were not unsafe. Some  per cent of council bridges are subject to such weight restrictions and some  are scheduled to be upgraded over the next five years.Mr Barker said: ldquoThe design le of a modern bridge is  years - and many Councils have ldquoheritage structures - many of Thomas Telford bridges, built in the early s are still carrying traffic.He added: ldquoThe recent history of ever deeper cuts to Council funding will obviously have affected bridge maintenance as it has other infrastructure maintenance. However, each council will have had to make current decisions against ahistory of previous decisions. Those decisions affect current condition.Only  bridges on trunk roads managed by the Scottish Government are substandard, about one per cent of the total. Some remote highways still have stone-built crossings, such as the listed th century Aray bridge on the A near Inveraray."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9256873.jpg?type=article-full","title":"climate-for-change-helping-the-environment-one-stitch-at-a-time","story":"Stitched was launched in  by Elinor Pitt and Will Verrill, as a solution to the alarmingly high levels of waste generated by the home furnishings industry.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Years Honours List in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Monday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And they contain a stark warning that the policy will see the attainment gap widen.The Scottish Government insists the tests are a “key part” of its drive to improve schooling standards.MSPs will start an inquiry into the tests this week, with a separate independent investigation into the testing regime already under way after having been announced by Education Secretary John Swinney.: John Swinney hits out at Fe council for scrapping P testsThe Scottish National Standardised Assessmentswere introduced last year and see youngsters tested in literacy and numeracy in P, P, P and S. But they have proved contentious with complaints that youngsters have been left distressed and teaching unions insisting they have little educational value.Joanna Murphy of the National Parent Forum of Scotland warned: “We are now in a situation with SNSAs that is entirely unacceptable: our children’s education is being used to score political points.”And in the forum’s submission to MSPs she hit out at a “repeated lack of good, direct communication” from schools, councils and the government to parents, saying: “When there is a vacuum of information it allows fear and anxiety to spread.” The Scottish Parliament has already voted for the tests in P to be axed after all opposition parties united to defeat the SNP government on the issue. Fe Council has announced it has scrapped the tests for the youngest pupils.And although the exams provide teachers with “exceptional information”, according to Ms Murphy, the information passed on to parents was branded “meaningless”.Eileen Prior, executive director of independent parents’ group Connect said the P test is being introduced at a stage where “learning through play” is the declared focus of the teaching system.“To introduce tests at this stage is to act completely counter to the purpose of this approach,” she said.The tests are a multiple choice exercise carried out online and delivered by the Australian Council for Educational Research International United Kingdom . Acer UK’s director of assessment and reporting, Juliette Mendelovits, will appear before MSPs this week. The same assessment is supposed to take place in every state school in Scotland, though teachers decide when to do them. They do not take place under exam conditions and ministers have said they should happen in “an informal and relaxed way”.Ms Sturgeon has pledged to drive down the gap in performance between schools in affluent parts of Scotland and less well-off areas and in a keynote speech in  called on Scots to judge her on this.But children’s organisation Upstart Scotland warned that the pressure of the P tests could exacerbate mental health problems, particularly in disadvantaged pupils. The body states in a submission: “It is therefore improbable that the introduction of SNSA will help close the poverty-related attainment gap – indeed, it is ore likely to widen it.”It added: “The First Minister’s call to be judged on her record in education means that SNSA is recognised by the public and media as a key factor of a high-stakes policy. As such, it puts considerable pressure on local authorities, schools and teachers.”Children in Scotland added that the assessments “appear to present a pathway to high stakes testing” and questioned their “validity and reliability”.But a submission from the Scottish Government insisted that the tests provide a “valid assessment” of children’s literacy and numeracy in line with Scotland’s Curriculum for Excellence.It adds that the “positive impact” of the assessments on learning and teaching is “clearly demonstrated” in a series of case studies published by ministers in October, and said: “The information can also help redirect learning and support teachers in looking at how certain groupings might be working.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4844356.1546858572!/image/image.jpg","title":"greenhouse gas emissions by scottish industry at 10 year low","story":"Greenhouse gas emissions by Scottish industry are at a ten-year-low, according to new figures.A report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyindicates a change in the pollutants emitted by Scottish regulated businesses as the country moves to become more sustainable and resource efficient.The analysis was published in the  Scottish Pollutant Release Inventory , which is a database of annual mass releases of specied pollutants to air, water and land from SEPA regulated industrial sites.Since , owners or operators of facilities that have met the SPRI reporting requirements have reported on an annual basis.Data from SPRI is used to fulfil the reporting requirements of the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register .It also provides information about off-site transfers of waste from industry sites.There has been an increase in the number of sites included in the data, with , reporting sites in , compared with , in .Scottish industry puts pressure on the environment through emissions to the air and water environment and through waste management activities.Green house gas levels have reduced % since  when  Megatonnesof pollutants were released.

They’re all numbers, my lot. I’m a complete anomaly. I’m a words person.”Shakespeare, poetry, Ted Talks, and over the phone too she’s a wizard wordsmith, but ask her about insider trading, stocks and shares and hedge funds and she’s stymied. No matter because what she CAN do is act, and it all adds up in her latest role in ITV’s Cleaning Up, in which she stars opposite Sheridan Smith as a pair of down-on-their-luck cleaners who find an ingenious,illegal, way of playing the system. The result is a darkly amusing tale of have-nots at the bottom of the social pile fighting back, using the same methods as the have-it-alls they clean up after in Canary Wharf, a tale about modern Britain with zero hours contracts and with strong female leads. Cleaning Up, written by newcomer Mark Marlow, and directed by Lewis Arnold Humans, Broadchurch, Misfits, Banana centres on the friendship between Anouka’s character Jess and Sam, played by Sheridan Smith. The actors hit it off at the audition, lending an ease and authenticity to their performances.“Sam and Jess have grown up together and Jess is the voice of reason, someone who thinks before she does, which Sam doesn’t, so they’re a good match. Jess tries to keep her out of trouble.”It’s not easy to stay out of trouble when you’re hard up and the pair are tempted to take a gamble, much like the financiers in the shiny offices the invisible army cleans overnight. “It’s about who deserves to get away with stuff,” says Anouka. “Being the underdog you feel you’ve got to look out for yourself andyou’re living hand to mouth, one mistake has massive repercussions. Seeing people get away with it, you’d feel like, ‘why shouldn’t I ’” “It puts the spotlight on the everyday people, the ones working hard to pay their bills, not living the high le, which is most of the country. It’s good to see people like that fighting back.”“I think a lot of people will just love Cleaning Up. When I watched it I was thinking about all the people I know and thinking ‘my dad will love this’ and that it really is one of those shows you will sit down and watch with your family, it’s brilliant.”Anouka is no stranger to cleaning up from when she worked in pubs and cafes to supplement her acting income, starting out. Last year was the first she’s made a living through acting alone.“When I was starting out there were times when I had three jobs. If I wasn’t auditioning or learning lines I was always working. I would wake up and go shoe shining, then in the afternoon work in a pub or cafe, then in the evening in a call centre, so it’s quite full on. There’s no chill time. That’s what you see in Cleaning Up, that these characters are always working and never get to relax.”Surprisingly, the bar work or call centre jobs are not the ones that come to mind when Anouka recalls her worst ever job.“Oh God, I was a children’s entertainer when I was at drama school,” she says, still scarred. “I did parties and face painting and that was fine, but it was before I had satnav on my phone and I’d get completely lost trying to find the houses so I’d be late. And I’d look ridiculous, in a yellow car carrying a red suitcase wearing green dungarees or a tutu and having to run into petrol stations to ask directions. Then turning up in tears because I was late and ruining their day.” The children’s “No, the parents, oh my god. The children don’t care, they don’t know you’re late. They were all fine. But the parents were so stressed, and I just wanted to burst into tears but you can’t come in dressed as a clown and cry. It was so stressful I had to stop.” Anouka has been making a name for herself on stage and screen, with the airing of last year’s psychological thriller Trauma, for ITV, with John Simm and Adrian Lester and The Donmar Warehouse’s All-Female Shakespeare Trilogy in , as well as cult hit Chewing Gum in .This last year has been busy for the  Screen International Star of Tomorrow, working on three productions, two theatre and one film. She took the lead as Queen Margaret at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, a composite of Shakespeare’s lines for Margaret of Anjou, a character he gave more words than any other, including Cleopatra and Rosalind, across four history plays. This production saw Anouka reassert Margaret as warrior queen, cutting a swathe through patriarchal power struggles in a re-telling of the Wars of the Roses, and at the same time waging a contemporary war on the historic gender imbalance in Shakespeare performance. Earlier last year she went forward in time to a dystopian world where blood quality can decide your credit rating in The Phlebotomist, and as well as Cleaning Up, she made the film, Fisherman’s Friends. Starring Tuppence Middleton and James Purefoy, it’s a feelgood tale of Cornish fisherman who land a record deal singing sea shanties, due out in March. She’s a familiar face north of the Border too, having won a Fringe First for her one-woman show Chef at the Traverse in  and the film of Donmar Warehouse’s Julius Caesar was up for best feature at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. “Incredible,” says Anouka, “considering it’s a live theatre recording. But Phyllida [Lloyd, the director], is also a film director so she knows what she’s doing. It’s quite special.”Born and raised in Greater London, Anouka is the middle of three children to a Jamaican father and Trinidadian mother. An athlete, she ran for Kent but got the acting bug at school and won a scholarship to the National Youth Theatre while at sixth form college in Lewisham.“Everyone there was going ‘yeah, I’m gonna be an actor, I’m going to drama school’ and I was ‘going to drama school  What’s going on ‘ere ’ Then after that I was like, “Oh, OK, I’m going to do this, it isn’t just a hobby, this is what I want to do.’” Guildford School of Acting followed and from there to the RSC, making her debut in  in Margaret Atwood’s Penelopiad. More theatre followed then TV with parts in Lucky Man and Doctor Who, before she landed the role in Trauma, ITV’S follow up to Doctor Foster, requiring her to learn how to rock climb. On stage, the Donmar Warehouse set her star rising too. Set in a women’s prison, the Trilogy of Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest, prompted Lloyd to hire an all-female ensemble cast of all ethnicities and ages to re-invigorate the Bard. Within a decade from first working in theatre Anouka was playing traditional male leads Hotspur, Ariel and Marc Anthony delivering the “Friends, Romans, countrymen…” speech.“It’s funny because I never liked Shakespeare when I was younger,” she says. ”But when I left drama school I got an interview with the RSC, ended up being there for two years and fell in love with it. And Shakespeare was where people started doing colour-blind casting. Everyone does Shakespeare at some point in this country and we need to look at why those plays should still be done, why they are relevant. So many seem quite modern in their themes – in a scary way I guess it’s history repeating itself.”She might be a words woman but Anouka likes a piece of the action too, and she played Hotspur as a kickboxer, preparing for the part by studying videos of Olympic boxing champion Nicola Adams, and training hard. “I grew up watching boxing with my dad, but they were big heavyweight guys, so I watched Nicola Adams, hours and hours of videos, how she trained. She even copied the Muhammad Ali shuffle. It was great fun, a great way to keep fit and I’d like to do it again. But I never sparred, not that, no-one’s coming near my face!” She laughs.Anouka writes and performs her own poetry, some of it published in her collection Eggs on Toast, and admits to sometimes finding it easier to express herself through poetry than through acting. She would love to combine theatre and poetry, her two loves, into a lyrical theatre piece, at the same time as popularising poetry by making it ‘less stuffy’. “With acting I find it often much harder to express what you want to say because you have less control over what’s going on. I started writing poetry a long time ago because I could use it to have my own voice, whereas in acting, obviously you try to take work that you think is good and represents you, but you don’t always have that luxury. So poetry is a way of being creative and having an outlet when you are not working in something that’s creatively interesting or fulfilling. And between jobs, I always have to do something that’s creative.”It was to her poetry she turned when she was invited to do a Ted Talk last year, reciting a poem she wrote that was inspired by Maya Angelou.“I’ve always thought of Ted Talks as being very intellectual, where you have to have a great invention or know about a particular topic so I wasn’t sure whether I deserved to be doing it or what I should do, but I thought what an honour! And I decided to speak from my experience, so it was ‘Being Black, being a Woman, being ‘Other’ and hopefully that strikes a chord with others, everyone who has felt Other.” And it felt natural to put poetry in there.” Anouka went on to talk about her crowdfunding a screening of Black Panther, the  black superhero film now tipped for an Oscar, for kids in her local area of Peckham because she thought it was an important film for them to see, a film that reflected the ‘other’ and underscored the belief that everyone was entitled to fulfilment and a voice no matter their creed, sexuality, culture or gender. “I couldn’t believe how much we raised. So much more than I expected that I’ve got a bit of money left over. We extended the screening so many more kids got to see it and I’ve given money to charities who work with young people, but I really want to do another film screening. That film was such a special thing, so it’s hard to know what the next film to do that for would be. But I’ll definitely do it again.” As for ersity, Anouka feels inspired by the changes she sees in the acting world, citing Sophie Okonedo, who recently won an Evening Standard Best Actress Award for her performance with Ralph Fiennes in Antony and Cleopatra. “She works in film, TV and theatre, which is a dream of mine. And she was in Undercover with Adrian Lester, who is a legend.”It was Lester who presented Anouka with the Ian Charleston Commendation Award for Shakespeare for Under s and having followed his career ever since, she was delighted to play his daughter in Trauma.“I think things are changing, definitely on stage particularly, it’s going in the right direction, but you can always do more. I think theatre is ahead of TV and film in this country, but I see it improving and more exciting stuff coming out.” “Queen Margaret was an example of that. Rather than just re-telling Shakespeare, it changed the lens we’re looking through, so it was all through Queen Margaret’s eyes.”Having played three of Shakespeare’s great male roles Anouka would love to take on more. “God there are so many. Loads of good ones!” she says and laughs. “I’d do LOADS of them! I’ve said before I’ve wanted to play Hamlet. Obviously it was written as a male role, but I see the character, not as a male character, but as a young adult, not quite knowing how to deal with grief and finding out about relationships, romance, all of these things coming in at once. It very much feels like showing somebody turning into an adult, and it’s something I would love to do before I get too old.”Anouka doesn’t talk about her age in a bid not to be tied down to age specic roles, witness her convincing teenager in Trauma. Similarly, she doesn’t talk about who she shares her south-east London flat or le with, apart from rescue dog Evie, who is possibly half Yorkie half Bichon Frise, “I’ve never seen another dog like her, so we’re waiting for a DNA test, just to see,” she laughs.As someone who has been in Doctor Who twice, Anouka has nothing but praise for Jodie Whittaker’s take on the Time Lord. “I wasn’t the right age for it when it came back – it was my little sister that watched it, but then I was in it and I thought gosh, it’s brilliant, are they all like this  And it’s not just brilliant entertainment, but important to watch, like the Rosa Parks episode. School children should all have to watch that episode, it was a great history lesson.”“And it’s important when you’re growing up to see things reflecting of your le, someone who maybe looks a bit like you, and more and more we need someone to do exactly this, be bold like Doctor Who and then the impact is going to be enormous. You realise how little it happens, because when it does, you see the impact. Cleaning Up’s like that, full of women leads, and you just don’t see that.” Next up, Anouka is in the new Idris Elba comedy, Turn Up Charlie, a series of eight half hour episodes for Netflix. She plays a DJ who is an arch rival to Elba’s character, a failing DJ working as a nanny to an out of control -year-old. “It’s nice to be doing comedy. Cleaning Up has humour in it but it’s lighthearted and heartwarming and sometimes dark, rather than actively trying to make you laugh. But this is more of a comedy and it’s out next year, so that’ll be good. Often people don’t think of me for comedy because I’ve done a lot of Shakespeare on stage and stuff, but I like it. I’d like to do more.” And since she’s as much about words as action, we’ll give the final one to Anouka and the call to action with which she ended her Ted Talk and summed up her attitude to inclusivity and embracing the Other in all of us: “When you get that chance, that opportunity, that seat at the table, get creative. And remember to pull up another seat for the next person.” @JanetChristieCleaning Up begins on Wednesday \u2028 January, ITV, pm©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852459.1546847127!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith deepening division over brexit can t become the new norm","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A new paper offers a path out of the Brexit swamp, so the issues that really affect people can be addressed, writes Brian MonteithLast week Gary Lineker made a fool of himself. He sent out a tweet picturing a supposedly official warning of an NHS in crisis with medicine and prescription shortagesthere is a no-deal Brexit. The Department of Health had to correct his misleading tweet with an official and direct response saying: “This is not an official NHS leaflet. People should trust advice from official NHS sources. We are confident thateveryone does what they need to do, medical supplies will be uninterrupted and patients will get their prescriptions as normal.”In addition Health Secretary Matthew Hancock had to issue a video providing reassurance there would be no shortages. Lineker had to take down the misleading tweet.: Brexit defeat in Commons could lead to second referendum on EUBefore then, in an even more ignorant and egregious act, the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford eroded any remaining respect opponents might have had for him by retweeting a comparison of the treatment of foreign residents following Brexit with the Holocaust. Despite being condemned by relatives of Holocaust survivors for his gross misjudgment that both belittled the crime and demonstrated a lack of awareness that the SNP’s White Paper on independence advocated removing residency rights from EU nationals in Scotland, there was no apology nor a retraction.It is bad enough for elected representatives to focus almost entirely on Brexit when there is so much in society requiring reform and improvement, but it is an especially sad reflection of our current political discourse that celebrities feel the need to ape our politicians who, after all, the public ranks as being among the least trusted and honourable of professions.The truth is – and we can all see it but few are willing to admit it – this Government’s cursed and botched Brexit process has, like the domination of the independence issue in Scotland before it, sucked most of the oxygen from policy debate and dominated column inches in all forms of media communication. Educational standards are being corrupted health and social care is well down the road to a cruel financial reckoning and a sense of disharmony and injustice is growing. Yet while these are real issues that affect people and can change for the worse inidual le chances, the priority of both the Government and opposition parties is Brexit. Even for the SNP, Brexit is the means to keep independence on le support.If one were to stop and ask any person in the street what particular action the UK Government is taking to improve the lives of its people, I wager that practically all, say at least  per cent, would struggle to offer an example of a policy. Nor do the opposition parties offer any comfort. Were members of the public to be asked what Labour or the rest are specically offering – beyond just doing the opposite of the Government – I again believe there would be general incomprehension. This might explain why, in the latest polling from YouGov, with Theresa May’s Government in disarray and Conservative MPs ided beyond what anyone living can remember, Labour has still fallen back five points to only  per cent while the Conservatives are at  per cent.How do we get back to normal – or is this deepening binary ision the new normal for a long time yet  One thing is certain: the Withdrawal Agreement will simply preserve the negotiating stasis as there is no incentive to settle anything until near the end of the transition period. This will only continue the growing mood of economic uncertainty for at least two more years – and in that way risk the recession that its advocates say they wish to avoid. It will maintain the growing polarisation of people across the land where nearly every conversation with friends and family tends towards Brexit and the impotence of political parties to bring about much needed change in society’s institutions is guaranteed.Fortunately the former trade secretary Peter Lilley and Labour Future leader Brendan Chilton publish today a paper entitled  Truths About Leaving on WTO Terms that, one by one, deconstructs the myths of departing the EU without a deal. Naturally it demonstrates how we could keep our £ billion to deal with our own problems, be free to create our own laws from day one, not be held back about making trade deals with China, the US or India and need not worry about availability of medicines, international flights or chocolate for Easter eggs . Notwithstanding all these and many other truths, possibly the strongest to recommend itself is thatwe commit to leaving and living with a World Trade Organisation deal then we can deliver to ourselves something we should all cherish – the debate will be over, we can move on, we canto normal.If May’s deal passes we commit the country to at least two more years of building up ision in our society. If after then there is still no deal acceptable to either partywe will be caught in an interminable maze we can wander around but never escape from.If we leave and make good of the WTO terms of trade – and the accompanying micro-deals on aviation, higher education, scientic research, citizenship of expatriates and the like – we canto fixing our outdated democratic institutions to mending our roads, rail and infrastructure to healing our health and social care systems and ing standards of discipline and learning to our schools. Yes, we shall still have to negotiate a trade deal but we shall have left and the whole issue will move from being dominant to a dull backwater compared with our real societal problems.Businesses, knowing again what they have to deal with, can make plans for trading under WTO rules and begin to make investment decisions. We might avoid an economic recession that in the cycle is now overdue and that two more years of negotiating paralysis and indecision about our future must only make more certain than all the scaremongering we have endured about Brexit.We might even see again the day when Lineker keeps his views about politics to himself and opines instead on football and sport. As for Blackford, with the sting of Brexit drawn, he can look forward to being a crofter again in a more harmonious United Kingdom.l Brian Monteith is a director of Global Britain©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852565.1546853225!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon brexit strengthens case for scottish independence","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has said the case for Scottish independence would become #all the stronger#MPs failed to secure a second vote on the UK#s membership of the EU with the prospect of a hard Brexit looming.The First Minister reiterated her party’s support for a second European referendum as “Scotland’s voice had not been listened to first time around”. But she conceded it was far from certain there was a majority for such a vote among MPs, unless Labour backed one.The Scottish Conservatives claimed Ms Sturgeon was “stuck in the past”.The SNP leader was speaking following the publication of a cross-party letter by MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit.Theresa May is intensying efforts to win over her Brexit critics and seek fresh guarantees from Brussels ahead of next week’s crunch vote on her deal.The Prime Minister acknowledged she was “still working on” getting further assurances from the European Union to address concerns about the backstop measure aimed at preventing a hard border with Ireland.But Ms Sturgeon insisted the best plan was to hold another vote on EU membership.: Playing a waiting game on IndyRef is dangerous for SNPSpeaking on BBC Good Morning Scotland, she said: “If we do get a majority for another EU referendum, SNP MPs will, as we did in advance of the  referendum, put forward proposals that would ensure that Scotland’s voice could be heard. We put forward a proposal last time round that said the UK could not leave the EU unless all four nations voted for that. We would seek to do that again.”When challenged that such a proposal would likely to be voted down in the Commons, the SNP leader said: “That is possibly the case but we will make the argument for it. If we have another referendum, and I hope the vote, UK-wide, would be to remainm, butwe have the same result, and I can’t guarentee that wouldn’t be the case, then it simply underlines the postiton that I think became evident after  - that Scotland’s interests cannot be protected within the current set-up in the UK.“As all of the events in the last couple of years have done, it makes the case for Scotland to be an independent country, in charge of our destiny, all the stronger.”The First Minister denied the consequence of voting against Mrs May’s plan was a no deal Brexit. She added: “Absolutely not. There is no reason whatsoever that should be the case.“There is clearly no majority in the House of Commons for the UK to crash out without a deal.”Good Morning Scotland host Gary Robertson also asked Ms Sturgeon whether the route to a second referendum on Scottish independence would be for the SNP to campaign on the issue ahead of the  Holyrood elections.She said: “I won’t get any further on timingbecause I’ve said I will wait until this phaseconcludes. What I will say is that everything that has happened over the last couple of years, from Scotland facing exit from the EU to every reasonable effort at comprosmise being spurned, all of that has strengthend the case for Scotland to be independent.”Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said there was no appetite among the people of Scotland for another independence referendum.He said: “One of the experiences of Brexit has been just how dficult and painful it can be to break away from a union, even one that has been place for just  years. A union that has been in place for  years would, in my view, cause considerable economic disruption and there is no appetite from the people of Scotland for it.“So I think the First Minister should take the earliest opportunity to rule out a second independence referendum.”Jackson Carlaw, Scottish Conservatives interim leader, claimed the First Minister was “stuck in the past”.He said: “Today Scots are heading back to work at the beginning of a new year, but Nicola Sturgeon is stuck in the past.“As at the start of , , , and  her priority is to rerun the referendum of .

Mrs May now faces a race against time to persuade enough MPs – including many in her own party – to support her plan, with the parliamentary arithmetic currently against her.Meanwhile, the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said a future Labour government would call a second referendum on BrexitMPs refused to support any new deal it negotiated with Brussels.Ms Thornberry said her party would be happy to “go back to the people”it won power at a snap general election but failed to get its own Brexit plans through.The MP, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn, also said Labour would back another EU referendumMrs May was replaced as prime minister by someone who backed a no-deal Brexit.Her views were echoed by her fellow shadow cabinet minister, Barry Gardiner, who said it would “make sense” to call another voteLabour won power and secured a fresh deal with Brussels.Labour’s current policy is to push for a general electionMrs May fails to get her Brexit deal through Parliament next week.But Mr Corbyn would be under pressure to back another referendumthis proved impossible, with a YouGov poll suggesting support for another vote is high among Labour supporters.The survey of more than , people, commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign, found that  per cent of Labour voters supported the idea of another referendum.Ms Thornberry said she believed that another general ­election was the most likely way of breaking the deadlock on Brexit, adding it could happen “within months”.She said in a radio interview thatthere was a general election Mr Corbyn would run on a promise to negotiate a new deal with Brussels, which would include a new UK-EU customs union.But she added: “If Parliament says, ‘This is just nonsense, this is no better than Theresa May’s [deal],’ we will put our hands up to that. We would, \u2028I think at that point, need to \u2028go back to the people \u2028again.”Mr Gardiner insisted that a Labour government would be able to get a “dferent, better deal” to the one secured by Mrs May as it would not have the same red lines.“At that stage it makes sense to go to the country and say, ‘Here we are, this is what we have managed to negotiate...we think it’s a better way forward’,” he said.“And it seems to me, at a personal level... that is the time when we would then say to people, ‘Now make your decision on what we have managed to conclude’.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852469.1546807757!/image/image.jpg","title":"record number of people using edinburgh trams","story":"The number of people using trams in Edinburgh increased by  per cent as figures show more than . million passengers travelled last year.The rise in passengers has been attributed to extra trams running at peak times, with some services running every three minutes.Operator Edinburgh Trams welcomed the figures released today and announced a pre-tax profit of £. million.The organisation is set to take on the responsibility and costs of maintaining the vehicles and infrastructure in , with an £. million annual fee paid to Edinburgh council for use of the trams, track and the tram depot.Lea Harrison, managing director of Edinburgh Trams, said: “Everyone at Edinburgh Trams continues to work tirelessly to deliver a safe, reliable and customer-focused service for our residents and visitors to the city. The additional responsibilities given to us as maintainer are recognition of our efforts and the council’s belief in our abilities to make cost savings for the city.”Transport for Edinburgh chief executive George Lowder said the transfer of responsibilities showed “Edinburgh Trams has come of age”, adding it “has proven itself for a fourth year as an integral part of the Transport for Edinburgh group and the backbone of the integrated Edinburgh mobility network”.City councillors are due to vote in March on plans to extended the tram network to Newhaven.The proposal estimates expansion could almost double the number of passengers using trams, with a predicted  million users in its first year.Lesley Macinnes, transport convener at Edinburgh council and chair of Transport for Edinburgh, said: “We’re nearly five years on from the launch of tram passenger services and the figures speak for themselves: every year, more and more people in the capital are discovering the benefits of Edinburgh Trams’ award-winning service.“It’s a reflection of how well Edinburgh Trams is performing as a company that we feel they are now ready to take on the responsibility for maintenance costs, as was always the plan when the current arrangements were agreed. Their continued growth in passenger numbers, improved service frequency and excellent customer service point to their readiness for this transfer of responsibility.“These next few months are vital to our development of Edinburgh’s public transport provision as our city continues to grow.“Council officers are refining the Trams to Newhaven final business case ahead of a decision by elected members in March.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"vandalism incident takes place in sumburgh airport car park ","story":"Police are appealing for information after three cars had their windows smashed at Sumburgh Airport.Each of the vehicles, which were parked in the main car park, had their door windows smashed.The incident is believed to have happened between pm on Monday and am on Wednesday.Police are asking anyone with information to contact , or attend Lerwick Police Station..."},{"url":null,"title":"creative project manager at shetland arts ","story":"Shetland Arts are seeking a Creative Project Manager to help drive forward our vision of a creative, connected Shetland that values art, culture and creativity, and the positive impact it can have on everyone’s le.The Creative Project Manager will be responsible for delivering a strategy that supports and inspires creative practice, formal and informal learning, outreach, performance, exhibition and programming opportunities throughout Shetland.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of .

Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonaldattended, as did Gerry Adams.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

We were found wanting and the players know that.#The only thing I will take from that is that it had reinforced in my own mind some of the players who are stepping up and others we will have to review.#Antrim actually hit the first point of the game through Paddy McBride in the opening minute, but they were to be swamped at the other end with the points flowing for Armagh before a stray Colm Fleming kick-out gave Ryan McShane a gt of a goal to move Armagh - to - ahead on  minutes.Their second major arrived a minute later, this time from a Jamie Clarke penalty after another stray pass resulted in Rory Grugan being hauled back in the area.By the time McBride added to the Antrim tally on  minutes, the game was gone as Clarke and man-of-the-match Stefan Campbell caused havoc at the other end with Armagh leading - to - at the half.McGeeney#s charges did appear to take their foot off the gas a little in the second half, but it was hard to blame them as the game became rather pedestrian.Credit to the hosts who kept plugging away with Niall Delargy and McBride leading the way in attack and they did grab a consolation goal through Eoghan McCabe with the last act of the game, but this was a rare blemish for Armagh who were worthy winners.“It’s the old adage of goals win games and once you concede two in three minutes it#s massive,” Harbinson added.“Armagh#s tackling was very good too and I thought maybe in the second half we were blown up for some easier stuff, but that#s the inconsistencies.“Armagh showed the desire of getting men forward and breaking lines, but we were just a bit slow in doing that.“It#s disappointing because the boys are working really hard and we know they are. We made eight changes from last week against Monaghan because we#re using the McKenna Cup to look at players, although some were enforced on us through injury. When you make all those changes, you run the risk against a very good team of being exposed and that#s what#s happened.”ANTRIM: C Fleming P Brannigan, R Johnston, A Sweeney P Finnegan, D Lynch, P Gallagher M Sweeney, E Walsh M McCarry, M Fitzpatrick, C DuffinK Quinn , E McCabe , P McBride .

Or, more accurately, David Stitt BSc Hons is on Twitter. Arlene Foster’s erstwhile photo companion has been busying himself of late on the Kilcooley bonfire in Bangor, which he’s determined to ensure is the biggest and the best in Are Wee Country.First up, Squinter’s not sure what Science Dee is a Bachelor of Honours in – the UDA man doesn’t say. But from the tweets about the appliance of structural engineering science to the massive edice, it might appear that it is in that field of endeavour that he excelled at university. We might be tempted to speculate on what university handed the qualication over to him, given the quality of the spelling on his Twitter account, but let’s stick to the matter in hand.On Thursday, as the bonfire crept out of the North Down troposphere and into the stratosphere, Dee gave vent to the vaunting pride that’s filling his barrel chest as the race for the title of Biggest Boney came down to the final furlong: “Kilcooley Bonfire, Well on its way to be Ulster Biggest .

Next day the Kilcooley boney fell down.AUGUSTAN open letter from Emma Little Pengelly, DUP South Belfast MP, on the Glidergate scandal#Thank you for giving me space in your paper to lay out my position on the Woodstock Road Glider stop, erroneously referred to by some as the ‘Short Strand’ Glider stop, among them the people who designed and built the Glider system and the people closest to it.It has been alleged that I have never before shown an interest in bus stops.. Nothing could be further from the truth. At university I was a founder member of the ‘Campaign to Save Ulster Bus Stops’ and I wrote a very well-received pamphlet which I distributed to membersentitled ‘Classic Bus Stops of Markethill and Richhill – Ulster’s Hidden History’. Furthermore, I have on occasion been on a bus, although admittedly not for a while. That the Glider stop I referred to is near the Short Strand is not in question, but since when did geographical proximity have anything to do with naming things  The Donegal Celtic football club on the Suffolk Road is not in Donegal. The Dublin Road is not in Dublin. Even the Woodstock Road is not in Woodstock, which most people are unaware of . So calling the stop Short Strand because it is near the Short Strand makes zero sense and is in fact potentially confusing. What is this place coming to when routes can’t be changed or amended just because they are traditional  SEPTEMBERSCOTLAND’S Shame, it’s called – the ,lb gorilla in the Holyrood Parliament that nobody wants to speak about. Many and frequent are the manestations of anti-Catholic sentiment at the very core of Scottish society, but the antics this week of a senior Labour Party official at the party conference in Liverpool has seen the issue reach a wider audience and that may make it rather more dficult for it to remain a dirty secret. Speaking from the , Scotsman Andy Kerr, Chairman of the Labour Party’s ruling National Executive Committee, invited a woman to speak and then added: “Did you cross yourself there  In that case I might not.” Not surprisingly, the ‘joke’ went down like a fart in a space suit as Andy obviously forgot that he wasn’t speaking before a select audience in Glasgow. The apology wasn’t long coming “unreservedly” with Andy adding: “I was trying to be lighthearted but what I said was ill-judged and wrong.” Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: “People from all parties and none will be appalled by this and by the casual dismissal of concerns.” Much as Squinter cheered Ruth’s decisive intervention, he must reluctantly point out that her party has blotted its copybook in the recent past when it comes to the matter of Catholics in Scotland. Last year a Conservative member of Stirling Council was readmitted to the party after being suspended for posting anti-Catholic comments online. Alastair Majury tweeted: “Why is the Catholic Church against birth control  Because they#ll run out of children to molest.”Of course, had Andy Kerr made a religiously loaded remark like the one he did about Catholics about, say, Muslims, or Jews, he wouldn’t have seen the end of the day. But in situ he remains, at the very heart of a party currently struggling with allegations of anti-Semitism which so far have not been solid enough to see any heads roll. The Zionist lobby which is after Jeremy Corbyn’s head would surely have claimed their first victory had this remark been aimed in the direction of Judaism. Perhaps you’ll remember that in July the Orange Order called off a parade in Glasgow. They called it off rather than obey a direction not to walk past a Catholic church where at a previous Orange Order march a priest had been spat at and struck with a baton by parade followers. Now the socialists have joined the KKK.

Under pressure from hardliners, British Prime Minister Theresa May wants the backstop done away with or, at the very least, subject to a time limit.The loyal Ulster factsKeeping the Pravince in the Single Market and Customs Union while the rest of the UK leaves is an existential threat to the future of Are Wee Country and the DUP is battling to “save the union”. The party is clear that there can be no ergence within the UK, except on things that it wants to erge on, gyeh morrage and abortion, for instance. A DUP source has promised to up the pressure on the Tory government: “We are going to squeeze their balls until their ears bleed.”Promises, promises# NOVEMBERWhich brings us to James McClean. Again. Since last year’s Remembrance Day festival the Derry native and Republic of Ireland international has switched clubs from West Brom to Stoke. In order to keep their fans informed ahead of the annual wearing of the poppy football shirts across the English leagues, the club issued a brief statement outlining the player’s historical stance and confirming that he wouldn’t be sporting a poppy on his shirt this year either.Despite the fact that nothing had changed – other than the name of the club at the top of the press release – the statement sent the Pravince’s media to DefCon , just as it has since the day and hour James spoke his first words on the topic, occasioning the familiar angry social media blast from Ulster’s stout yeomanry. There’s a delicious and very fitting circularity in this local saga:just as nothing has changed in relation to James McClean and the poppy, nothing has changed in Ulster’s attitude to it.DECEMBERA BURNING question finally gets its answer. No, it’s not about Brexit, or world hunger, or famine or plague. It’s simply this: what do you call this item pictured below left  You may never have given the matter any thought, but Squinter has, because, well# because that’s the kind of guy he is. Fact of the matter is that you’re very unlikely ever to ask for one because  out of every thousand of these things sold are simply lted by the customer and brought to the counter or check-out without a word. If you have a shopping list it will simply say ‘milk’ and everyone knows exactly how large or how small their milk requirements are.But every time Squinter buys one he asks himself why he doesn’t have a clue what it’s called and, further,a tourist asked him what it was he wouldn’t be able to answer. So, enough being enough, Squinter put the question to Twitter – and back came around  replies, some of them fairly sensible, some#. Quart.. Barrackbuster.. Big milk.. Flagon Jar.. Green milk..

She said: “I told her I hope you have the health to enjoy it. I would say I was more shocked than Frances because she doesn’t really get excited. She’s so level-headed. What she says and what you see, that’s her.” But within days of their win, social media accounts appeared on Twitter claiming to be the couple and offering money to people.Earlier, they had said they had drawn up a list of  people and organisations who will benefit from the jackpot. One of the suspect profiles, that spells Mr Connolly’s surname wrong in the Twitter handle, has already amassed more than , followers.  The National Lottery would not disclose whether Mr and Mrs Connolly had any active social media accounts, but warned people to be wary of anything that looked “too good to be true”.It said: “The National Lottery, winners of The National Lottery and other lotteries are sometimes ly imitated on the internet in a iety of ways — often to try to make people believe they are going to be entitled to money. We would urge people to remember thatsomething looks too good to be true, it probably is.” The official National Lottery Twitter account has also been replying to people flagging the accounts. In one reply it said: “We are aware that there have been some fake profiles set up. If you see any that you believe to be fake, please report them to Twitter.”Another reply said: “We are trying to do what we can to stop this, but unfortunately we’re unable to stop people from setting up profiles on other s.”Online safety and cyber safeguarding expert Wayne Denner urged people to be cautious and to look for red flags. He explained: “There are always a lot of clues when these sorts of things happen. People need to be very careful when they are using any social media . “You should take five minutes and think about it, and do a little bit of research.“You look at some of their engagement rate, some of their followers, do you know any of them  Are they following legitimate accounts  How long has their account been set up  Is there a profile picture  Is there a website address “All of these types of things are simple things that anybody can do, which will always give a little more information about whether it’s a legitimate account or not.”Mr Denner said that by engaging with such profiles you leave yourself open to scams.“It’s so easy to manipulate the relationship on social media and it’s so easy to create and take images from other parts of the internet and pass them off as legitimate,” he added. “It’s very easy to set up fake accounts online, and that’s the major problem. “There isn’t a social media  in the world that doesn’t have an issue with this.“Platforms themselves have more work to do in relation to genuinely verying the legitimacy of iniduals using their s. But always remember:it does sound too good to be true, then it often is in the online world.”It’s not the first time local lottery winners have been mimicked by scammers. In  police issued a warning after bogus emails claiming to be from Strabane jackpot winner Margaret Loughrey were used in an online fraud.A spokesperson for Twitter said it does not comment on inidual accounts for privacy and security reasons. They added: “Impersonation is a violation of the Twitter Rules, and accounts which impersonate to confuse or deceive people may be permanently suspended.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660616.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/cattle_prod_seized.jpg","title":"cow prod used on pedestrians in northern ireland town from passing vehicle","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential. It is available to all men and women affected by domestic and sexual violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for upgrade at Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE need for major improvements at Ardglass harbour to allow signicantly larger vessels to enter the port has been highlighted by former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie.Her comments come after last monthrsquos annual EU Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels which determines how much fish can be landed at the local port and at the neighbouring harbours of Kilkeel and Portavogie.EU chiefs have decided to reduce prawn quotas by just over % to ensure the species ldquostays within sustainable levels, while the herring quota has been reduced by %.The Fisheries Council also determines how many days boats can put to sea, but the December meeting will have been the last UK fishermen were represented at ahead of the Brexit at the end of March.Welcoming some of the outcomes from the Brussels negotiations, Miss Ritchie has urged British and Irish governments to resolve what she described as ldquooutstanding problems in the fisheries sector to build the economies at the three Co Down fishing ports.She explained that the Fisheries Council consists of EU Fisheries Ministers who decide on the annual quota allocations for range of species mdash including prawns and white fish mdash which are the main staple of Northern Ireland fishermen.Miss Ritchie said she was concerned there has been a slight decrease in the amount of prawns which can be landed locally, after a series of successive quota increases over recent years.ldquoIt is important that the British Government has realistic proposals capable of implementation in place to safeguard and grow our local industry, said Ms Ritchie.ldquoThere are also other fishing issues that require resolution as they present ongoing challenges to the catching and processing sectors. They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

insisted that Baroness Thatcher would have been \"horried\" by the Prime Ministers Brexit deal as he backed calls for a second referendum on EU withdrawal.The former Tory party chairman and ex-Cabinet minister said Lady Thatcher would have been against Theresa Mays plans because they hand too much power over to the remaining  EU states.Margaret ThatcherLord Patten told the Press Association: \"I think Margaret Thatcher would have been horried at the idea that we should negotiate things that are really going to matter to our future in circumstances in which  EU member states each have a right to veto what we want to do.\"Because from the end of March onwards,we go out on Mrs Mays terms every member state has a veto on what we want.\"At the moment, things have to be decided by a qualied majority, but after the end of March its a vote for everybody.\"Lord Patten said he had reluctantly come to the conclusion that a new referendum was the only way to end the Brexit \"shambles\".Former Tory minister and Hong Kong governor Lord Patten speaking during a Peoples Vote event at Coin Street Neighbourhood Centre, central London.He said: \"Ive travelled quite a long way because I have never voted for a referendum in the past, but I think it is probably now the only way out of this terrible shambles.\"The comments came after Lord Patten spoke at an event organised by the Peoples Vote campaign for a second referendum, where he urged MPs to reject the PMs deal when it comes before the Commons next Tuesday.Lord Patten compared Mrs May to Dr Strangelove, the scientist in Stanley Kubricks Cold War satire about nuclear destruction.The Tory peer dismissed Mrs Mays warning that rejecting her deal could lead to the UK crashing out of the EU without an agreement.Former Tory minister and Hong Kong governor Lord Patten speaking during a Peoples Vote event at Coin Street Neighbourhood Centre, central London.He said: \"I dont believe that the Prime Minister or many members of her Cabinet think that this would be remotely responsible. It would be very damaging.\"These are similar to the tactics made famous by Dr Strangelove:you threaten that something crazy will happen, your opponents will back down.\"Daughter of NI lottery winners: I don’t want anything from their fortuneParkand flats evacuated after historic piece of munition discovered Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

At this point there are no certainties. Theresa May could be gone by the middle of next weekshe doesn’t get the Withdrawal Agreement through the Commons. Or, she could somehow get it through, but with the ‘backstop’ still in place and unionists angrier than they have ever been. Or, there could be an extension to the Article  negotiations. Or, another referendum. Or, another general election. Or, the formal splitting of the Conservatives. Or, Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. Or, maybe Boris Johnson. The UK could still be in the EU. Or, the UK could be out, but without a deal and in trading waters which haven’t been charted by the country for decades. As I say, anything is possible. What is clear – indeed, what has been clear since the general election in  – is that there isn’t a majority in the House of Commons for a clean-break exit from the EU. Actually, the only party which is in favour of the clean-break deal is the DUP. And nor, I sense, is there a majority for an exit without a deal. ButMrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement goes down the pan next week – and the arithmetic still seems heavily stacked against her – it will not be possible to construct a coalition around an alternative. So she will still be trying to persuade the EU to sht on the ‘backstop’ but that will only happenthere is a % guarantee that she can keep Rees-Mogg and co on board for the vote.Shortly after the vote of confidence in Mrs May, Rees-Mogg hintedthere were legal clarity on the ‘backstop’ he might be prepared – even though he still had dficulties with it – to support the agreement. In his speech to the DUP conference in November Boris Johnson laid into the ‘backstop’, but also made it clear that there were many parts of the agreement he could live with. The DUP would, I think, be happy enough to back itthe ‘backstop’ was gone and Rees-Mogg’s ERG was on board. All to play for, then.Shortly after the ‘backstop’ became public I suggested it would ‘be useful’the DUP and Irish government‘sat down for a couple of days to seethey could find something they could all live with’. That approach still strikes me as sensible. Adding the Irish voice to the mix would also be more persuasive for the EU negotiators. A bespoke deal – one which recognises very specic Irish interests and doesn’t create constitutional uncertainty for unionists– has always been possible and the DUP should have focused on that rather than the uber-unionist dimension of their deal with the Conservatives: which, let’s face it, hasn’t worked out all that well so far. All of this requires grace, compromise and commonsense from London, Dublin, Belfast and Brussels. It’s still not too late.Prime Minister Theresa May could be out of a job as early as the middle of next weekMeanwhile, it’s going to be a busy few months in NI. My understanding is that the RHI Report will be published ‘reasonably quickly’ : and it is not overegging the case to say that its findings, conclusions and recommendations could determine Arlene Foster’s position as DUP leader. The latest round of talks is also due to kick start in the next few days, but I don’t see any evidence that either the DUP or SF is in a mood for compromise. That’s not surprising, given that the local council elections are due in May and parties are always reluctant to give hostages to fortune just before voters head to the ballot box.I can’t see the DUP taking a huge hit –only because none of their pro-Union rivals seem capable of landing a blow on them. But it is worth remembering that in the last elections, in , the DUP was slightly behind SF in votes . Mind you, that was on a % turnout. Turnout will be considerably higher this time – at least %, I think – and the campaign could be brutal in terms of toxicity. That benefits both big parties. A ‘bad’ or ‘dficult’ Brexit deal will also have an impact. It may also be the first election fought by an SDLP Fianna Fáil coalition, so it will be interesting to seethe Colum Eastwood Micheál Martin gamble pays off, or goes the way of the UUP Conservative UCUNF deal. Success has to be measured by the electoral hit it inflicts upon SF. Nothing  matters. The entire project is predicated upon the joint interests of both parties being geared towards stopping and then reversing the electoral damage that SF has done to both of them. Another general election remains in play. Again, the odds favour the DUP. They could lose South Belfast, but offset it with North Down. North Belfast could be a problem for Nigel Dodds, but he’d probably survive. An Assembly election can’t be dismissed, either. Unionists regaining their overall majority is not possible, so the DUP’s main concern will be staying ahead of SF . An SDLP FF pact, particularlyit picks up a couple of seats from SF, could actually be quite good for the DUP. And a brutal DUP versuss a new pan-nationalist frontbattle would probably see votes and seats sht from the UUP to he DUP.For columnists and commentators all of this is manna: it’s always good to have something to write and talk about in my line of work. But, as I say, everything is in play and anything is possible.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

The alarm was raised by her friends, and they, together with members of the public and a Penarth RNLI volunteer, helped to keep her safe before the leboat was launched.A throw line was used to reach the casualty, and lejackets were obtained from the leboat station.The ywoman was struggling to hold on, and with high spring tides the RNLI crew member entered the water to fit her lejacket and support her, knowing that the leboat crew had been paged and were on their way.The D-class leboat was launched quickly, and brought the casualty and the Penarth crew member safely back to the station.A medical check was carried out on both, and although cold and wet they were deemed fit and well.Jason Dunlop, Penarth RNLI Leboat Operations Manager paid tribute to all those involved: \"With such a high tide, in darkness and in cold water, the casualty could have easily drted out of sight. By hanging on as she did and with the support of everyone involved the rescue was affected quickly and safely.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A union that has been in place for  years would, in my view, cause considerable economic disruption and there is no appetite from the people of Scotland for it.ldquoSo I think the First Minister should take the earliest opportunity to rule out a second independence referendum.Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: ldquoToday Scots are heading back to work at the beginning of a new year, but Nicola Sturgeon is stuck in the past.ldquoAs at the start of , , , and  her priority is to rerun the referendum of . People across the country will correctly be thinking, lsquoThere she goes againrsquo.He added: ldquoThe best new yearrsquos resolution the SNP could make would be to drop the independence obsession and concentrate on delivering for the people of Scotland.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, accused the First Minister of trying to ldquoweaponise Brexit.ldquoNicola Sturgeon couldnrsquot be more wrong, said Ms Nash.ldquoBrexit has weakened the case for independence, not strengthened it. The process has proved how incredibly dficult it is to leave a union between nations.ldquoNicola Sturgeon is trying to weaponise Brexit in a desperate bid to boost support for independence.ldquoBut the majority of people in Scotland know that we are better off together, with a shared culture and history we can build our future on.ldquoThe First Minister should take the threat of a second referendum off the table and get on with the day job of fixing our schools, hospitals and railways.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said:ldquoThe nationalists appear to have learned absolutely nothing from Brexit.ldquoLeaving a successful economic and political union leads to upheaval and uncertainty.

We expect week-on-week improvement through January and February to get your service back to normal levels.ldquoWe know you deserve better. The entire ScotRail Alliance ndash a partnership between ScotRail and Network Rail Scotland ndash is focused on delivering that and we will give you a better service.Protesters gathered outside Glasgow Central Station on Monday morning to call for action to be taken against the rail operator.Last month, the Scottish Government told ScotRail to submit a plan to address falling performance levels.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard is calling for public ownership of railways Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard attended the protest and backed calls from unions for the railway franchise to be removed from Dutch operator Abellio and ed to public ownership.His party criticised the compensation as a ldquogimmick which is ldquojust not good enough and said a real compensatory move would have been to back their call for a fare freeze.Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Jamie Greene said the offer would not adequately compensate passengers for the ldquochaos they experienced, adding: ldquoWhat they want is real action taken to ensure that they have an effective and reliable train service that they can rely on, not cheap offers to buy them off.Mr Leonard urged the Scottish Government to use the break clause in the ScotRail franchise to take the railway into public ownership.ldquoWersquove seen in the last weeks fares going up, so many of the commuters coming into Glasgow this morning are paying extra for a service which is worse and we think there is huge support for aof ScotRail into public ownership, he said.ldquoIt would mean that every single penny that passengers pay would be reinvested in the railway instead of the current situation where part of that goes back to pay shareholder idends in Holland.He added that since publicly-run Network Rail is operated as part of the ScotRail Alliance there was a ldquostrong case for the entire rail network in Scotland to become a publicly-owned and run integrated service.Liz Warren-Corney of the TSSA said that Transport Secretary Michael Matheson would have to leave his post for this to happen as she believes he is ldquoideologically in favour of privatisation unlike her view of his predecessor Humza Yousaf.QuestionedMr Matheson would have to go to achieve change, she said: ldquoYes. I donrsquot think that would be a bad thing.ldquoThe job of Transport Secretary is to stand up for passengers and when it comes to ScotRail, he has done anything but.She added: ldquoI think politicians need to bow to the will of the public and ultimatelythey see this is what the public want then, yes, they will go that way.ldquoWe certainly saw that Humza Yousaf was very much open to the idea of bringing ScotRail into public ownership.ldquoUnfortunately, hersquos gone and Matheson has now bottled it, frankly, and clearly will do anything he can to prop up Abelliorsquos failing operation of ScotRail.The Scottish Government has called on the UK Government to devolve all matters involving rail A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoRail remains a reserved matter under the Scotland Act.ldquoUntil this changes, we cannot consider the full range of options for running the railways in Scotland in a way which best suits our passengers, freight providers and communities.ldquoThat is why we are yet again calling on the UK Government, through its rail review, to devolve all rail matters to the Scottish Ministers. Anyone with a genuine interest in improving our railways should get behind this.ldquoUnique in the UK, the Scottish Government has secured powers to accept bids for future rail franchises in Scotland from public sector organisations through the Scotland Act .ldquoThis was after repeatedly being denied that right by successive Labour and Conservative governments.An Abellio spokesman said: ldquoAbelliorsquos focus is on delivering the existing franchise to the highest possible standards, working hard to put in place a railway that better connects passengers, businesses, and communities across Scotland..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: ScotRail issue apology for  uunacceptable u service amid cancellations article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
