It\u0027s hard to take it back\u0027 and said they were \u0027both very forgiving\u0027. The father-of-three said he is now \u0027on the mend\u0027 following his heart problems and says he hopes to travel to London to see the couple and meet his \u0027new royal family\u0027 including the Queen.Mr Markle says he hopes he has not offended Meghan and Harry by appearing on GMB.But royal experts have claimed that this could be the death knell for his relationship with them if it was without their blessing.Kensington Palace declined to comment on Mr Markle\u0027s interview - or his claims about Harry\u0027s political beliefs.  In an extraordinary world exclusive interview Mr Markle revealed: Father-of-three said he was upset to have missed his daughter\u0027s wedding and watched in tears from \u0027the couch\u0027 of a B\u0026ampB after being discharged from hospitalSaid he was now a \u0027footnote on one of the greatest moments in history\u0027 - and he was jealous but thankful that \u0027handsome\u0027 Prince Charles stepped inHe has apologised to the couple for his staged paparazzi photos calling it a \u0027serious mistake\u0027 that Harry and Meghan were \u0027very forgiving about\u0027Thomas says he is looking forward to coming to London to meet Harry soon, calls Queen an \u0027incredible woman\u0027 and would love to see her during visitMeghan has always wanted children - and says although she is not pregnant there will be a child soonHe is recovering well from heart surgery but couldn\u0027t have physically walked down the aisle a month agoHarry told him he was \u0027open\u0027 to Brexit and said that Trump should be \u0027given a chance\u0027Today\u0027s TV interview marks the first time Mr Markle has opened up about his daughter, the tumultuous build up to her wedding and his future relationship with Meghan and Harry.His absence from the wedding shocked Meghan and was so last minute his name was still in the Order of Service.   Today Mr Markle thanked \u0027handsome\u0027 Prince Charles for stepping in on the day and giving his daughter away, but added that he was \u0027jealous\u0027 as he watched from the US.He said: \u0027She was beautiful.

The rest of the things were just be careful.\u0027But they were very emphatic about not giving any information to the press or talking to them, because it just encourages them more. So none the less, that\u0027s what I tried to do.\u0027Despite these conversations however, allegations later surfaced that he had staged photographs with the paparazzi.Footage obtained by The Mail on Sunday showed the 73-year-old former lighting director arriving at an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner.‘It was presented to me as a chance to change my image because for the last year photographs of me were always derogatory,’ he told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid.‘They would take pictures of me with my hand on a beer, taking the bins out, buying a toilet and making a big deal of it and it all made me look negative.‘I didn’t do it for money, I did it to change my image. For one whole year I was presented as a hermit hiding in Mexico but obviously I made a mistake and it all went wrong.I spoke to them both and I apologised. I realised it was a serious mistake but it’s hard to take it back but again it was to improve my look, I had been seen negatively for an entire year.’   On Prince Charles…\u0027I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history\u0027: Thomas Markle\u0027s regret at not giving Meghan away as he says he was jealous but thankful \u0027handsome\u0027 Prince Charles stepped in          Prince Charles took Meghan Markle to the altar in the absence of her father and symbolically had entered St George\u0027s Chapel alone Mr Markle thanked Prince Charles for stepping in on the big day and giving his daughter away, but added that he was \u0027jealous\u0027 as he watched from the US.Calling the prince \u0027handsome\u0027, he said he could not think of anyone better to walk his daughter down the aisle in his absence.Mr Markle told Good Morning Britain: \u0027It might have been a treat for him as well because he has never had a daughter.\u0027I was honoured. I can’t think of a better replacement then Mr Charles. He looked very handsome. I was jealous, I wish it was me but thank God he was there.\u0027He said he still had not met Prince Charles or spoken to him on the phone but that he looked forward to \u0027thanking him\u0027 when he eventually met the royal face to face.Mr Markle\u0027s absence from the wedding shocked Meghan and was so last minute that his name was still in the Order of Service on the day.He said: \u0027She was beautiful. I cried a little watching her. I was very proud and I couldn\u0027t see a better moment in my life. The whole world was watching my daughter.\u0027The unfortunate thing now is that I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history instead of a dad walking his daughter down the aisle.\u0027It was a very emotional moment. I regretted it because I really wanted to walk her down the aisle. But I\u0027m thankful for how it all went\u0027.  On the Queen…Meghan\u0027s dad reveals he is looking forward to meeting Prince Harry and the Queen in London as he calls Her Majesty \u0027one of the most incredible women in the world\u0027          The Queen insisted Prince Harry was not required for her first engagement with Meghan in Cheshire last week and Mr Markle says he has admired her Majesty since childhoodMr Markle said that he was \u0027on the mend\u0027 following heart surgery and hoped to come to London \u0027soon\u0027 to finally meet his son-in-law and the rest of the royal family, including the Queen.He told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid that the Duke of Sussex remained the only member of the royal family that he had spoken to so far but he was hoping to be introduced to his \u0027other family\u0027 in the near future.The 73-year-old said he could not give an exact time as to when he would see the couple again but claimed he was happy to wait a little bit longer so they newlyweds could spend some time alone.\u0027I look forward to it,\u0027 he added. \u0027I know they are very busy. Right now they\u0027ve earnt the right to go away on a honeymoon.\u0027Going forward I would certainly love to meet the Queen. I\u0027ve had respect for that woman since I was a child.\u0027I think she\u0027s one of the most incredible women in the world and I\u0027d love to meet her.He said that Harry and Meghan offered to come and visit him after the wedding, but he told them it was \u0027a bad idea as the press would eat them alive\u0027.Speaking about his health and travelling abroad in the future, he added: \u0027I\u0027m on the mend and I\u0027m feeling much better. Doctors are making me lose weight and take care of myself so I\u0027ll be ready to go.\u0027  On becoming a grandfather…\u0027She\u0027s wanted children for a long time\u0027: Thomas Markle talks grandchildren as he says a child \u0027will be in the making soon\u0027 for Harry and MeghanMr Markle said that he expects his daughter and Harry will want to try for children soon.He told the programme: ‘She\u0027s wanted children for a long time and when she met Harry and she spoke about how much she loves him, there\u0027s got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon.’Mr Markle said: ‘As long as they\u0027re happy and they have a great life and have some beautiful children and do good things in the world, I can\u0027t ask for more.’  On pulling out of the royal wedding…Meghan\u0027s father reveals she cried when he told her he couldn\u0027t make royal wedding because of a heart attack as he says both she and Harry told him to \u0027take care\u0027          Mr Markle watched the moment the couple married from a sofa in a Californian B\u0026ampB, he revealed todayThomas Markle Snr choked back tears as he reflected on the royal wedding and revealed how he had planned to attend the big day until he was forced to pull out at the eleventh hour.He broke the news to Meghan about his absence in an emotional phone call just days before she was due to walk down the aisle in Windsor Castle\u0027s St George\u0027s Chapel.He said: ‘They were disappointed. Meghan cried, I\u0027m sure, and they both said: “Take care of yourself, we are really worried about you”.’He added: ‘I was very proud. I was very upset that it wasn\u0027t me (walking her down the aisle) but the whole world was watching my daughter. I was very happy about that.‘The unfortunate thing for me now is I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle. That upsets me somewhat.’  On Meghan’s nickname…Meghan\u0027s father reveals he calls the Duchess of Sussex \u0027Bean\u0027 because she loved Jack and the Beanstalk as a child          Mr Markle said he has a wonderful relationship with his daughter (pictured with his daughter) despite the tumultuous times they have had recently - and revealed he calls her \u0027bean\u0027 because she loved Jack and the BeanstalkMr Markle revealed the inspiration behind his pet name for daughter Megan is the name of the English fairytale Jack and the Beanstalk.The doting father said that as a child Meghan was obsessed with the story about a little boy who plants a magic bean which grows into a giant beanstalk and allows him to visit a land of giants.During the interview, Piers asks: \u0027You call her Bean, why?\u0027Mr Markle responded: \u0027When she was a child she loved Jack and the Beanstalk and because she is so small I call her Bean or Beanie and then eventually it became Beanie and the Beanstalk so I call her Bean all the time.\u0027I don’t think I’ll call her Duchess. I don’t have to, that’s my daughter.\u0027He also spoke about Meghan\u0027s upbringing, and how he and his ex-wife Doria were determined to not let their break-up affect their child.He said: \u0027We didn\u0027t express anger towards each other so she never felt that. Doria and I have always had a good relationship and she felt loved, there wasn’t a problem with that ever.\u0027Doria and I get along and we talk. I still bring her flowers every mother\u0027s day. We’ve always had a good relationship around our daughter and between the two of us. It shows in our child.\u0027          Some viewers were not pleased by Thomas Markle\u0027s comments, describing his actions as \u0027odd\u0027 and \u0027attention seeking\u0027      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/14/4D5F3F6300000578-5856697-The_73_year_old_pictured_on_GMB_described_his_sorrow_about_pulli-a-8_1529329263441.jpg","title":"PIERS MORGAN reveals inside story scoop Thomas Markle","story":"    Thomas Markle has finally broken his silence as he expressed his regret at not walking his daughter Meghan down the aisleBut it was a moment watched by over a billion people around the world, and it was a moment that should have featured Thomas centre stage, proudly at his daughter’s side as she married into the British Royal Family.Instead, he was on his own in a B\u0026ampB room 6,000 miles away, watching it all unfurl on TV as tears streamed down his face.‘She was beautiful, I cried a little watching her,’ he said.As he said this, his face crunched with emotion and my natural journalistic cynicism evaporated.I was very critical of Thomas Markle in the week leading up to the wedding, believing his shocking decision to collude with a paparazzo photographer over staged photos came very close to wrecking the biggest day of his daughter’s life.It was a particularly dumb thing to do after Kensington Palace specifically asked the media to leave him alone.The understandable press frenzy that erupted after the bombshell revelation exacerbated Thomas’s existing heart problems, and meant he couldn’t fly to London.‘By taking the paparazzi shilling, and now missing the wedding,’ I wrote at the time, ‘Thomas Markle broke his future son-in-law’s trust, and his little girl’s heart.’I stand by that harsh judgement it was indefensible behaviour.          The 73-year-old (pictured on GMB) described his sorrow about pulling out just three days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle because of heart surgery and admitted he was jealous but grateful that Prince Charles stepped inBut after my lengthy interview with him today, conducted with my GMB co-host Susanna Reid, I’ve changed my mind about this rather shy, gentle man whose life was irrevocably changed forever when Meghan fell in love with Harry.First, he fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging those pictures.‘I realize it was a serious mistake,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to take it back.’Second, it’s almost impossible to comprehend the tsunami of attention that cascaded on the poor guy’s head from the second the engagement was formally announced.His account of how he discovered the identity of Meghan’s new man was both comical and endearing: ‘The first phone calls were, “Daddy, I have a new boyfriend.” And I said, “That’s really nice.” And the next call was like, “He’s British,” and I said, ‘That’s really nice.” And eventually the third time around was like, “He’s a prince.” And at that point, she said, ‘It’s Harry.” And I said, ‘Oh, Harry, OK!’    Markle fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging pictures in an internet cafeFor a man eking out a quiet retirement of considerable solitude in a remote part of Mexico, this would prove to be a spectacularly inconvenient revelation, though he is far too proud of his daughter to admit it.To their shame, senior Palace officials didn’t immediately put someone on a plane to take care of Thomas Markle.One burly, wily ex Household Cavalry guard sitting outside Mr Markle’s front door all day - and none of the chaos that followed may have happened. Or why not just fly him to London a month early – it’s not like Kensington Palace doesn’t have enough bedrooms?Surely both Harry and Meghan must have known he’d be subjected to intense media scrutiny? Yet they did nothing to help him, leaving the former Hollywood lighting director to face the cameras himself for the first time like the proverbial rabbit in headlights.  Mr Markle revealed that his daughter (pictured together above) cried when he told her that he wasn\u0027t coming to London          Harry and his bride are seen on their wedding day as they leave St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor CastleI still find this failure to protect him incomprehensible, just as I find it weird that Meghan’s mother Doria had to go to the wedding entirely alone, that Harry STILL hasn’t met his father-in-law, that Meghan STILL hasn’t visited her father since his heart attack, and that Prince Charles has had NO contact with Thomas Markle despite taking his daughter down the aisle.But hey, all families are a bit weird – right?I believe Thomas when he says his motivation to do the staged photos was more about improving his dishevelled image than money.(Just as I believe his motivation for appearing on Good Morning Britain today for his first ever TV interview was more about setting the record straight than the relatively small fee we paid him.)There had been a steady flow of pictures of him looking like an overweight, unshaven, beer-swilling vagrant. Who wouldn’t be tempted to try to create a more positive ‘look’ for themselves in the run-up to starring in the biggest wedding of the year?I also believe him when he says he only wants the best for Meghan and Harry. Thomas Markle strikes me as a man who genuinely loves his daughter, and thinks Harry’s the really lucky one to have landed his ‘little Princess’.Marks \u0026 Meghan! The Duchess of Sussex teamed her £4K Oscar...\u0027Promise me you\u0027ll never raise your hand to my daughter\u0027:...\u0027I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history\u0027:...Share this articleOf course, there will be some who think he should have kept his mouth shut, just as I did in the run-up to the wedding.But that was then, and this is now.After all the feverish speculation, rumour and gossip surrounding the chaotic furore of that week, it was good to hear the truth from the horse’s mouth – told in a soft, thoughtful manner that most of our viewers seemed to find endearing and sincere.The Palace, which had no prior knowledge of our interview, will have gone into spasms of horror that Thomas revealed Harry’s views on Donald Trump and Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.After all, the royals are trained to never give their political opinions about anything.But Harry’s views – according to Thomas, he’s ‘open to the Brexit experiment’ and thinks President Trump should be ‘given a chance’ - seem more diplomatic than especially controversial.If I were the Palace, and Meghan and Harry for that matter, I would bite my tongue and try to see Thomas Markle’s interview in the way he intended it to be: a candid, honest account of what it’s been like to live through the blazing firestorm of life as a first time father-of-a-royal-bride.    Thomas Markle said he was \u0027honoured\u0027 that the Prince of Wales took on the job of walking Meghan down the aisle insteadNone of us is perfect, and none of us would survive such intense scrutiny unscathed or without doing a few silly things along the way.I don’t doubt Thomas’s sincerity when he says he did what he thought was the right thing at the time.It wasn’t, and as he freely admits now, he’ll now have to live with that for the rest of his life.But any man who, as Thomas Markle does, travels to Los Angeles each year to place flowers on his ex wife Doria’s doorstep on Mother’s Day is not a bad man.In fact, after today’s interview, I’ve come to the conclusion he’s a thoroughly honourable, decent man who is understandably struggling to make sense of a crazy new existence that was entirely of someone else’s making - albeit someone he loves very dearly.He’s also having to do it with barely any support.I congratulate him on his courageous candour today, and wish him well with his recovery.As for his future as a royal father-in-law, I simply say this: good luck Thomas – you’ll need it!"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/14/4D5C0CF100000578-0-image-a-10_1529329982999.jpg","title":"Prince Charles joins Queen annual Garter Day service Windsor Castle","story":"Share this articleLook charming in prints like Sophie in a dress by Emilia WicksteadShop the current collection at MATCHESFASHION.COMIt\u0026#39s been a busy few months for the Royal Family.

She didn’t appear to have any other medical or psychiatric illness … She just did not appear to be a psychiatrically troubled person at all. ‘She had children, she had a normal family – and so I remember, when the priest said to me: “Dr Gallagher, that’s what I thought, but we wanted to make sure that we checked her out medically,” I said, “Well, Father, you know I’m pretty sceptical.” And he said, “That’s the type of person we wanted.”‘So then he continued to send me things he and his colleague, who was an ex-Marine, who had also become a prominent exorcist … I actually became very good friends with them. They’re both deceased now, but I miss them terribly.’Before that first case – and his relationship with exorcists and the demonic world – he says he was unaware of the intricacies of possession and oppression.He grew up a devout Catholic, one of five children born to an Irish-American lawyer and his homemaker wife. Dr Gallagher attended weekly Mass with his family and studied at renowned Catholic high school Regis in New York City before being accepted to Princeton.‘I didn’t know what I wanted to be,’ he says. ‘I probably wanted to become a lawyer, a professor or something. I did like helping people, you know – so when I was at Princeton I had a number of roommates who were pre-med, and I just got interested, intrigued by the idea of becoming a doctor. And I’ve also read a lot in my life, so I got interested in psychoanalytic ideas, and it just kind of dawned on me that helping people, as well as becoming a professor, would be interesting if I did it as a professor of psychiatry. So that’s what I decided to do.’He laughs: ‘I’m the black sheep who became a psychiatrist in an Irish Catholic family.’Following Princeton, he played semi-professional basketball in France and taught English at a French high school. Then he trained as a resident in psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, and he is currently on the faculty at New York Medical College and Columbia University Psychoanalytic Institute for Training and Research.  It was as his career progressed, however, that his acquaintance with the world of evil spirits intensified. He says he’s seen about four cases a year, though he’s heard of hundreds more, especially at meetings of the Europe-based International Association of Exorcists.He mentions the case of another US housewife, though he does not specify her location. This woman – he gives her the pseudonym of Catherine - ‘as a teenager had dabbled in satanic rituals, and she had kind of promised herself, in some fairly foolish way, to evil spirits,’ he says. ‘She did a few grisly things, which I’m not going to go into, but she also, with a couple of friends, they did minor satanic rituals and she became possessed.            Ferrer Bassa (1290-1346) painted this work showing St Bernard of Clairvaux exorcising someone possessed the Catholic Church has a strict set of criteria for determining demonic possession - which can afflict any culture, age, race or religion, Dr Gallagher says          Dr Gallagher, pictured during his days at Princeton, where he was a Classics major before he pursued a career in psychiatry‘She was certainly violent when the evil spirit took over, and she had a variety of signs of possession. It took multiple, multiple people to hold her down during exorcism.’He adds: ‘She had a very odd symptom, which is similar to a case in the gospels, where she selectively couldn’t hear certain things … If you said to her: “Catherine, did you go to the store today?” Shey’d say “yes.” “What’d you buy?” “Meat and potatoes.” If you said, “Catherine, did you go to church today?” She would say, “What?” “Catherine, did you go to church or did you pray today?” “Did I what?”‘Her sense of hearing was blocked. So we had the bright idea – I was with a fellow psychiatrist, we were assessing her – and we had the bright idea, why don’t we write it on a piece of paper?‘So we wrote it on a piece of paper: What did you do this morning? And she said, “Well, I drove the car to the gas station, I had to fill up the gas tank.” “Catherine, did you pray today? Did you go to church?” and hold it up on a piece of paper.‘Do you know what she said to me? She said, “Dr Gallagher, why are you doing this?” I said, “What do you mean?” “Why are you showing me a blank piece of paper?”’‘Now the obvious motive there was to prevent her from being able to talk about anything spiritual, get the help that she needed, get the solace and spiritual support she needed.’The evil spirits take hold of people, he says, because they truly hate God and humans.‘We have the ability to love and turn to God they don’t. They made their choices, and they hate the image of God in human beings,’ he says. ‘They truly seem to hate human beings. I mean, not only do they want to destroy us spiritually, alienate us from God, but they seem to take almost a sadistic pleasure in destroying us as creatures who can still turn to God, to their enemy, creatures who can also still love, which they don’t seem capable of anymore. They’ve rejected the whole idea of goodness and love in a kind of perverted way.’Gay Christian rock star backed by Archbishop of Canterbury...Exorcism 101!

On one occasion, a demon told him how his mother had died – ovarian cancer. That evil spirit also knew ‘how 15 other people’s parents died, too. It wasn\u0027t just me.’On another occasion, a demon told him exactly what a priest was wearing though the clergyman was nowhere near Dr Gallagher and the possessed person speaking. In a different case, Gallagher was also personally addressed.‘I had a demon say to me: “How’s that book going? It won’t do any good” … that’s when I was first thinking of writing a book. So I’ve had demons come and they’ve said they hate me, but again, I think they hate all Christians … they certainly put more of their energy in saying how they hate the exorcist. That’s their real target, not me.He tells another story of a woman in her 30s, a member of a Satanist cult who was thinking about leaving – which is when the evil spirits took over her body.This woman ‘was in the back of a car once, and I was with the exorcist, and she went into a trance,’ he says. ‘She was unequivocally possessed … and I heard her in the back seat of the car.‘She came out with some vile stuff – “Leave her alone you f*****g priest”, that sort of thing, and this went on for about five minutes. Then she came out she had no remembrance of it at all.’                            I understand believing in evil spirits is not a very comforting belief ... when you\u0027ve seen some of these cases, you realize that this is clearly not something that could be explained by psychopathology or trickery or anything like that                         He continues: ‘I never went to her exorcisms, because I was busy … but the priest would invite me to come to the exorcism. It wasn’t around here. And I’m on the telephone line, this is a landline, with the priest at the time, and he says, “You know, Rich, can you make this exorcism session?” And then, during that phone conversation – and this woman was hundreds of miles away … that same voice came in on the phone and it said “Leave her alone, leave her alone, you f*****g priest. She’s ours, she’s not yours.” And I did hear that. That was creepy.’He says that, despite his work and beliefs regarding demons and possession, he has ‘never felt particularly harassed or discriminated against, because Americans tend to be kind of a tolerant, pluralistic people.‘In the larger society, it’s not a fringe belief,’ he says. ‘This is actually a mainstream belief. Opinion polls show that probably about 60 percent and upwards – probably about 70 percent of America – believe in the devil, and the majority of Americans … believe in evil spirits and demons have some ability to directly attack human beings.‘People will sometimes say to me, “How do you feel about talking about a fringe belief?” I say, “It’s not a fringe belief. I’m more mainstream than skeptics. The other thing about skeptics is, the extreme skeptics, they’ve never seen a case.‘They come up with all kinds of cockamamie theories … they say, “Well, you know, this person heard Latin babbled as a kid.” But it’s kind of absurd. The demon is speaking fluent Latin and is understanding fluent Latin, and many of these people are not even Catholic, didn’t even go to church as a kid.’He adds: ‘I understand believing in evil spirits is not a very comforting belief, and it has implications that, you know, we don’t want to accept. Having said that – and there’s plenty of alternate theories I don’t think that those theories usually hold water – and when you’ve seen some of these cases, you realize that this is clearly not something that could be explained by psychopathology or trickery or anything like that.’And, despite having witnessed evil and his interactions with demons, he says he’s not particularly worried that they’ll come after the psychiatrist himself he’s bolstered by his faith and the faith of others.‘I have a lot of people praying for me,’ he says.‘I’m not seeing the devil everywhere,’ he explains, adding: ‘I always tell people it’s an equal mistake to see the devil everywhere as to deny the devil exists.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/14/4D67D63000000578-0-image-m-34_1529413427441.jpg","title":"Italian interior minister wants census Roma communities","story":"    Shocking: Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, called for a census on the Roma community and said \u0027unfortunately we will have to keep the Italian Roma because we can\u0027t expel them.\u0027His plans have  been met with resistance from fellow government politicians, with Luigi Di Maio, the leader of Salvini\u0027s coalition partner the Five Star Movement, calling it \u0027unconstitutional\u0027.Non-government politicians went further, with centre-left Democratic Party (PD) saying his call revived memories of \u0027ethnic cleansing\u0027. EU sacrifices Italy and Greece to save Merkel: France and...300 migrants taken in by Spain after Italy turned away their...Plan for Rome seeks to avert dangerous tensions, reap...Share this article\u0027You can work for security and respect for rules without becoming fascist,\u0027 tweeted Democratic lawmaker Ettore Rosato.\u0027The announced census of Roma is vulgar and demagogical.\u0027  Tens of thousands of Roma, also known as \u0027Romani\u0027 or \u0027gypsies\u0027, live across Italy, many in squalid shantytowns on the outskirts of major cities and on the fringes of society.            Anger: Roma people  protest as Salvini arrive in a camp on the outskirts of Rome in MayLater on Monday, Salvini appeared to backtrack, and released a statement saying the government had no intention of setting up a separate archive for the Roma or taking finger prints. The statement added that the government wanted to protect Roma children who were barred from going to local schools by their parents, and to check how EU funds aimed at helping marginalised communities were being spent.This comes just a week after Salvini set off a storm in Europe last week when he refused to let a charity ship carrying more than 600 mainly African migrants dock in Italy.Spain eventually took in the boat, with Salvini saying Italy would no longer automatically take in boat migrants, who have used Libya as a springboard in recent years to seek a richer, safer life in Europe.Salvini, whose League party scored huge gains in March 4 elections on its xenophobic platform, has vowed mass expulsions of migrants. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/21/4D58FEE600000578-0-image-a-44_1529354459725.jpg","title":"Love Island star Zara McDermott boasts makes laws","story":"The 21-year-old is understood to work as a junior member of the policy team advising Education Secretary Damian Hinds, and has taken an unpaid career break to compete in the tawdry reality showAccording to The Sun, Miss McDermott told her managers she was taking a \u0027career break\u0027 to take part in a television series but didn\u0027t mention she would be appearing on Love Island. The paper reports the high-flyer, who previously worked for Michael Gove at the Enviroment Department, has been warned she must not break strict rules on expressing her views on politics in public. A government source told The Sun: \u0027She needs to be very careful because the rules are quite vague about what would be deemed bad behaviour so she could end up getting sacked.\u0027The DfE said civil servants on career breaks \u0027must abide by the civil service code\u0027 which may come at odds with some of the choices of clothing inside the villa. Miss McDermott\u0027s Instagram page alone is stuffed with pictures of her in bikinis and skimpy outfits which may jar with the powers that be in Westminster.            The glamorous brunette has been branded a ‘rising star’ of the civil service, having undergone a two-year apprenticeship after finishing her A-levels and joining the Department of EnergyThe glamorous brunette has been branded a ‘rising star’ of the civil service, having undergone a two-year apprenticeship after finishing her A-levels and joining the Department of Energy.On her LinkedIn page, Miss McDermott claims she developed policies, dealt with parliamentary questions and briefed ministers. She has been working at the Department for Education for eight months.In April 2016, Miss McDermott posted a picture of herself inside No 10 on Instagram, captioned: ‘My office for the day. My job is better than yours.’The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-level.Arriving on the ITV2 show in Majorca, she told her fellow contestants she ‘works in the government’.          The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-levelWhen asked if she was responsible for making laws, she replied ‘yeah, in essence’. She is appearing on the show after being granted an unpaid career break by the DfE in line with civil service rules, which state civil servants can have a career break of between three months and two years.It is thought DfE bosses might not necessarily have known she wanted the break in order to appear on Love Island.While the show’s controversial nature may raise eyebrows among Miss McDermott’s employers, her mother Karen insisted she was proud of her. Speaking about her ‘very academic’ daughter, Mrs McDermott, 56, added: ‘We’re behind her 100 per cent. She obviously spoke to us when she was first talking to the show and said she wouldn’t do it if we didn’t want her to.‘We told her to enjoy it and have the best experience of her life. We hope she finds her man.’ She said daughter ‘loves her job’ and is ‘passionate about making a difference’. All civil servants must uphold the civil service code – which says workers must show integrity and professionalism while away from government – while on a career break. If these terms were broken, human resources would be notified and would launch an investigation.However, workers who keep to the terms may return to work as normal. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/21/4D633CF600000578-0-image-a-14_1529355138016.jpg","title":"Now thats royal tea party Meghan Markels dress Queens hat Eugenies frock","story":"    Say cheese, Ma\u0027am: The Queen wears a hat to match a Wedgwood cheddar dish at the polo on Sunday¿I¿ve changed my mind about Meghan¿s dad ¿ he¿s just a shy,...Share this article    Don\u0027t put it in the dishwasher: Meghan in her plate pattern dress at a wedding on Saturday          Spot the inspiration: Kate channels the Polka Dot china collection by Royal Vale          Someone\u0027s blossoming: Pregnant Pippa plumped for the delicate look of a flowery teacup at the Royal Wedding          Saucer sorcery: Camilla\u0027s jacket at yesterday\u0027s Order of the Garter Service nods to the Royal Albert Black Diamond pattern          I\u0027m a little teapot: Princess Eugenie\u0027s poppy outfit is as chintzy as this pot          Roses are red...

She was fitted with a \u0027bow chaser\u0027 gun that was mounted in the middle of her fore deck. For service during the First World War she had her bow chaser removed, and her gun mount transferred to the fore peak, according to National Historic Ships UK          Above: how the gunboat looked before the restoration work began in 2017. Mr French said large sections of the vessel were rotten from where she had been left exposed to the wind and rain for nearly two decades in the boatyardDuring the restoration, Mr French found 32 bullet holes in its hull from where it had been riddled with Turkish machine gun fire while grounding on the beach at Gallipoli. Years after the Boer War had ended, Caretta was re-assigned to the naval fleet, in 1915, due to her expendability, and sent to the Dardanelles to assist in the landing of troops, according to National Historic Ships UK.She had her bow chaser (mounted cannon) removed and her gun mount was moved to the fore peak (front end of the hold).Caretta was then fitted with a Maxim machine gun to give her a higher rate of firepower and allow her to cover troops landing on the beaches at Gallipoli. A photograph from the time is believed to show Caretta at Anzac Cove, with her twin funnels noticeable in the picture. Her gun mount is still on board today and is situated under the galley worktop.The vessel went on to serve during the Second World War and it is believed she was seized by the Admiralty for use in Operation Dynamo (the 1940 evacuation from Dunkirk), with her masts removed prior to departure. The forward cabin at the time of Dunkirk, above. Caretta was launched in 1898 at Devonport Dockyard, part of a new breed of small armed boats that were designed to protect the fleet at anchor and allow armed patrols.

Although the vessel has been given a pre-sale estimate of £60,000, the vendors have been told it could go for almost three times that because of her remarkable history.It would represent a huge profit for Mr French, an aircraft engineer, and his 32-year-old wife, who are from Ryde on the Isle of Wight.Mr French, 39, said: \u0027We had been looking to buy a little classic boat as a restoration project.\u0027I saw Caretta on eBay, it was a chance find. The advert didn\u0027t list all of her history, it just said she was a bit old and a bit special.          Unique 120-year old roll of honour.

It is believed she was seized by the admiralty for use in Operation Dynamo and her masts were removed prior to departure\u0027We jumped in a bit head first and bought it from the photos. She would never have seen the light of day again otherwise.\u0027It was only later that we discovered her true history. I couldn\u0027t believe my luck as she is a true one-off. There can\u0027t be that many ships that served in three different wars that are still floating today..\u0027The Caretta was launched in 1898 as a small armed boat designed to protect British battleships and cruisers at anchor.          The bow still had bullet scars from the beaches of Gallipoli. In 1915, the gunboat was assigned to the fleet and sent to the Dardanelles for the landing of troops. She had her bow chaser removed and her gun mount was moved to the fore peak. She was then fitted with a Maxim machine gun to give her a higher rate of firepower and allow her to cover troops landing on the beaches at Gallipoli          Owner Arron French said large sections of the vessel were rotten from where it had been left exposed to the wind and rain for nearly two decades in the boatyard.

I didn’t realize it was so easy,\u0027 she told New York Magazine. On Tuesday, Sorokin\u0027s lawyer Todd Spodek would not go into specifics of the case but said: \u0027Our position has always been that the people will not be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Sorokin intended to defraud her friends and colleagues.\u0027  Sorokin\u0027s case received notoriety from two lengthy articles in Vanity Fair and New York Magazine.Among those who have spoken out about it are some of her alleged victims including staff at the hotel where she stayed. They told how she tipped with $100 bills and gave off an air of extreme wealth.           Sorokin (far right) is pictured in September 2014 with Giudo Cacciatori, Gro Curtis and Giorgia Tordini at The Jane hotelOne, who was the receptionist at 11 Howard where Sorokin stayed for a month, told how she once attended a dinner she organized for a large group at Le Coucou which included MaCaulay Culkin. Others described how restaurants began calling them after seeing pictures of them with Sorokin on Instagram and asking to be put in touch with her because she had skipped out on her bills. The truth is that she was born in Russia and grew up in Germany as the daughter of a truck driver. She left Germany in 2011 to move to London where she attended Central St. Martin\u0027s College as a fashion student.Her father told New York Magazine that they had supplemented her rent and schooling at first and that he was stunned by the news she had been arrested. \u0027We always paid for her accommodations, her rent, and other matters. \u0027She assured us these costs were the best investment. If ever she needed something more at one point or another, it didn’t matter. \u0027The future was always bright,\u0027 her parents, who did not want to be identified, said in an email. User Data and Cookie Consent"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/19/4D692C0700000578-5862221-image-m-9_1529432126153.jpg","title":"Country mansion runway hangar goes sale 1 75m","story":"    Woodscombe Farm, above, sits between Exmoor and Dartmoor national parks, close to the village of Nomansland and eight miles from Tiverton.

It was, Harry Kane said, ‘what dreams are made of. I’m so proud. We fought to the end.\u0027‘Obviously you get such a good feeling with any goal you score. But to score a winner in a World Cup is just incredible. The celebrations — and watching the celebrations back home and in the stadium — incredible.‘I have been part of that before when I was a kid watching football — to see it and be part of it was amazing.’He is also not one to let the fact that England’s display was the most-watched television programme this year — a peak audience of 18.3 million saw it on BBC One, more than the 13.1 million peak for the Royal wedding — go to his head.Kane’s gentlemanly values and unabashed patriotism — witness his full-throated rendition of the national anthem before Monday’s match — certainly bring to mind Bobby Moore, his most illustrious predecessor as England captain.High and dry! Panic for football fans as Moscow faces...Female sports reporter bravely carries on presenting as...Share this articleHere is a man so thoroughly decent that he once spent two hours signing autographs in the car park after training with his club, Tottenham Hotspur. Why? Because, as he says, he was once a Spurs fan himself, and remembers how it felt to be snubbed by one’s idols.This is a global superstar who still returns to watch his school football team who represents a charity that preserves London’s green open spaces speaks out with concern against childhood obesity spurns nightclubs for the simple pleasure of a family meal at his local curry house in Essex, where a member of staff yesterday told the Mail how he had ‘thrilled’ her son with the gift of a signed football.In interviews, Kane — not even born when Bobby Moore died in 1993 — says he was inspired by two past England captains when making his way in the game: Wayne Rooney (who, somewhat ironically, gave him advice on the company he should keep) and David Beckham, who hails from the same East London manor, and attended the same school.However, Google the names Rooney and Beckham along with ‘scandal’ and you will find all manner of lurid allegations, playing away from home being the common denominator.Do the same with Kane and one finds only one slur: that he once teased Liverpool supporters over a dubious penalty decision.When it comes to romance, Harry is strictly a one-woman man. In his teens, he began dating Kate Goodland, an apple-cheeked fitness instructor whom he has known since primary school, and says he could never countenance going out with a lingerie model or C-list celeb.          When it comes to romance, Harry is strictly a one-woman man. In his teens, he began dating Kate Goodland, an apple-cheeked fitness instructor whom he has known since primary school, and says he could never countenance going out with a lingerie model or C-list celebBy way of his heritage, Kane might easily have played for Ireland had that country’s football association been quick enough to spot his potential.His late maternal grandfather, Michael John Kane, a talented footballer whom he credits for his ‘sporting genes’, was from Connemara, and Harry still has cousins in County Galway, two of whom are locally famous as singers, the Kane Sisters.However, when remembering his less-than-smooth rise to the top of the game, he thanks his parents, Pat, 54, and Kim, 51, who encouraged him unstintingly and were invariably on the touchline when he played for his school and local team, Ridgeway Rovers. There is praise, too, for his elder brother, Charlie, 29.It was his father who kept Kane from aping many of his England teammates and covering himself in tattoos. He once said, ‘My dad would never let me. I used to want some, but Dad always told me I would regret it when I was older.’Neighbours have recalled them as a close-knit family and one remembered: ‘We used to see him carrying the goal posts with his brother to the park. One of the brothers was taller and the posts used to travel up the road at an angle.’Like Moore, the young Kane lacked pace. He was so slow, in fact, that Frank Lampard Senior — who watched him train — suggested he buy running spikes and practise sprinting. (Kane mistakenly bought javelin-throwing shoes, and had to send them back.)Though he now stands at a sinewy 6ft 2in, he was also quite small and slight, and had to bulk up in the gym.Kane was clever enough to pass his GCSEs, and according to his former PE teacher at Chingford Foundation School, Mark Leadon, he ‘put his head down and worked hard at everything he did’.Nevertheless, he set his mind on becoming a footballer from an early age, and was determined to make the most of his talent.At 11, however, he was rejected by Arsenal’s academy and had a spell with Watford before being signed by Spurs. Then, in his teens, there came more setbacks. While other starlets were breaking into the first team, he was loaned to teams such as Leyton Orient and Millwall, where he fought tooth and nail to prove himself and gain his chance in the Premiership.Among Tottenham’s fans, it has made local boy Kane a folk hero. ‘Harry Kane, he’s one of our own,’ they sing proudly. As for female supporters, ignoring his longstanding relationship — not to mention his slight lisp and strong Essex diction — many declare their undying love for him.‘What a heart-breaker!’ cooed one devoted fan on Twitter.          Kate also shared an image of Ivy in an England shirt with Kane’s shirt number, 9, on the back, with the caption ‘Let’s go Daddy!! #worldcup2018’‘I’d marry him tomorrow,’ was another typical comment. As children, he and Kate lived ten minutes’ walk from one another, but they only began dating in 2011 after being friends for years.With her bottle-blonde hair and perma-tan, a taste for fashionable clothes and brightly-coloured bikinis, plus a growing army of Instagram followers, she may seem, at first blush, the archetypal WAG.But Kate is no Coleen Rooney or Victoria Beckham, say insiders rather she’s a modest, low-key young woman who prefers to spend evenings at home with Harry, watching movies, rather than go out on the town.Nonetheless, her lifestyle has changed considerably since she and her boyfriend had dates at Lee Valley cinema, followed by fish and chips.The couple make no secret of their love for the finer things in life, posting snaps of their exotic holidays online, and they have a fleet of three luxury cars: a limited edition Bentley Continental GT Supersports costing an eye-watering £233,800, a Jaguar F-Pace, and a Range Rover Autobiography.Like many top footballers, Kane supplements his £10 million-a-year salary with lucrative endorsements. He has appeared in commercials for Mars bars, and Beats By Dre headphones.In a sign that he is ready to raise his profile beyond the confines of football, we also saw him at this year’s Brit Awards, where he gave out the Best Solo Artist award. Then again, even unassuming Bobby Moore wasn’t averse to doing the occasional TV ad.Of course, whether Kane can emulate Moore’s feats in 1966 is quite another matter.But if and when England are knocked out of the tournament, one thing seems guaranteed: there will be no histrionics from the captain. No Gazza-style weeping in full public view.‘The last time I cried was a long time ago. I don’t really cry at films or anything like that,’ says Kane, surmising that it was probably in 2004, when, as a ten-year-old boy, he watched Portugal eliminate the national team from the European Championships.In fact, he admits, Kate was upset with him because he failed to shed a tear at the birth of their daughter.But then, that’s England’s new Captain Marvel. He may be a New Age Man, he may be a true gent — but he certainly isn’t a cissy. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/21/4D6BE61500000578-5862671-image-m-80_1529441650477.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle channels Audrey Hepburn Fair Lady outing Ascot","story":"    Wearing a black and white hat by another new favourite, Philip Treacy, Meghan gave a modern twist to a famous outfit from the Hollywood musical          In My Fair Lady, Cockney flower-seller Eliza Doolittle – played by Audrey Hepburn (above) – wears a frilly white gown with black and white bows and matching hat          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Sophie the Countess of Wessex (centre) during day one of Royal Ascot at Ascot Racecourse          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall speak to the Duchess of Sussex (left) during day one of Royal Ascot at Ascot RacecourseFormer actress Meghan, 36, wore £1,350 yellow gold and diamond stud earrings by Birks, a black belt and black stilettos as she rode in the Queen’s carriage procession.She and husband Prince Harry received a rapturous welcome and later presented a winner’s trophy to jockey Frankie Dettori, who kissed her hand. Inside the winner’s enclosure, Meghan – who pinned her royal enclosure badge to her bag rather than her dress – could be seen getting on famously with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, who was resplendent in gold Dior and another Philip Treacy hat.

For now, you should register your phone number with the Telephone Preference Service online at tpsonline.org.uk or by calling 0345 070 0707.Once your number is on this list it is illegal for companies to cold call and try to sell you something.If caught, firms face a fine of up to £500,000 by the watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office.However, signing up won\u0027t stop all nuisance calls.

Then, instead of your phone just ringing, you will be played their message so you can decide if you want to pick up.If you don\u0027t want to answer you can refuse the call and put the number on your block list. Friends and family can be added to a list of safe callers so they will get through every time.For the service to work, you must have a home phone which displays the numbers of callers on a screen.TalkTalk offers its customers a similar service called CallSafe.It has a national database of known unwanted callers that it blocks from getting through, and you can add further numbers to the list.It also offers a service that will reject calls from anyone who withholds their number.TalkTalk automatically creates a list of approved callers from your regularly dialled numbers so friends and family members can get straight through.You may want to invest in a standalone call-blocking gadget such as a trueCall device.This is a small plastic device that plugs in between your phone and the wall socket.It also intercepts calls to request that the caller states their name before being put through, and you can add numbers to a block or safe list.If the caller refuses to state their name, your phone won\u0027t even ring as they will be blocked automatically.Trading Standards has a small number of these gadgets to give away for free, so call your local council to see if you qualify.

If you do so the company is legally required to stop sending marketing texts.But only do this if you are sure the message is from a legitimate company, such as your mobile provider or another firm you have dealt with in the past.If you are in any doubt, ignore it. Replying just confirms to the firm that your phone is active and they may hound you all the more or sell your number on to other crooks.Watch out for messages that appear to come from your bank or the taxman.Fraudsters are able to make it appear as though their text messages have been sent from a legitimate company.These spoof messages are often very convincing because they appear in the same thread as other genuine texts.To be safe, never click on any link or call a number given to you in an unexpected text message — even if it claims your account has been suspended or blocked.If you have any concerns call the phone number on the back of your bank card or statement.HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs says it will never contact taxpayers about refunds or request personal details by text message.It advises people to forward any suspicious messages to 60599 (there may be a small charge if you do not have free text messages as part of your contract).                                                    If you think the call was from a fraudster, report it to Action Fraud at actionfraud.police.uk, or by phoning 0300 123 2040. Blocking phone numbers on a smartphone is also easy. If you have an iPhone, for example, tap on the green square icon with a picture of a phone to pull up your recent calls list.There will be a little blue circle with an \u0027i\u0027 for information next to the nuisance caller\u0027s number.Tap on this, scroll to the bottom of the list of options and select \u0027block this caller\u0027.You can also download the free TPS Protect app which will help identify different types of nuisance calls.If a number is in the app\u0027s database because it\u0027s been reported by another user, a message will pop up telling you what type of company is calling.For example, it might say \u0027insurance\u0027 or \u0027PPI\u0027. It will also tell you if the number is a \u0027suspected scam\u0027. You can then reject the call and use your phone\u0027s settings to block it for ever.You can also report numbers by filling out a few details on the app, which will help other users. Details of reported calls will be passed on to the watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office.The app also gives telephone numbers a \u0027trust score\u0027 of between one and five, where one is likely to be a scam and five a company with a low number of complaints.But these are not always accurate so stay vigilant.For 99p a month you can add numbers to an automatic block list so that your phone doesn\u0027t ring when they call.But remember, you can already do this for free as we explain above. With the more advanced version of the app you can also choose only to accept calls above a certain trust score.The app can\u0027t identify calls that come from a withheld number.Instead, you may want to decline them so they are erted to your voicemail.moneymail@dailymail.co.ukGood for big potsGood for big potsFee back in trades Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/21/4D6C24B400000578-0-image-a-51_1529441136860.jpg","title":"Pablo Escobar mistress says portrayed pervert Narcos praising Penelope Cruz film","story":"    Smoking mad: \u0027My portrayal in Narcos is as a pervert, and a criminal and corrupt journalist that in the end is tortured and killed,\u0027 said Virginia Vallejo (above), Pablo Escobar\u0027s mistress          Drop the mic: She added: \u0027The purpose of the script was to defame me brutally and rape me in front of millions of people\u0027 (a character based on Vallejo and Escobar in Narcos above)      Tommy Lee says he paid $130,000 for his son\u0027s rehab as he...Fox host Laura Ingraham under fire for calling detention...Share this articleVallejo said in interview, with El Mundo, that Escobar\u0027s wealth was of no interest to her at the time.\u0027I was not interested in luxuries because I had an elegant life as a child.

Or a politician who, at last, alleluia, is prepared to scythe through some of Whitehall\u0027s knots and actually get something done? Or both?For decades, Whitehall has slowed political change to the speed of a glacier. Some will say that is because the brilliance of our unwritten constitution is that it prevents hot-heads from making revolutionary changes. Others will say it is because Whitehall likes to retain the power and therefore blunts politicians\u0027 promises of action.Look at politicians\u0027 attempts to stop vexatious prosecutions of British Armed Forces veterans. Look at proposals to reduce death duties. Look at the time spent on the Iraq inquiry. Look at Brexit. All have been paralysed by officialdom.Mr Javid, king the English language, was breaking the inevitable Whitehall review into two parts. The first would be run by chief medical officer Sally Davies. The second would be run by the (vast) advisory council on the misuse of drugs.           Javid was so over-excited at the start of his Statement yesterday that he swallowed half the syllables in the word \u0027efficacy\u0027Mr Javid said Prof Davies could do her review work in a week.

Someone mentioned that Lord Hague was calling for the legalisation of all cannabis. \u0027He\u0027s wrong!\u0027 shouted Simon Hoare (Con, N Dorset).Norman Lamb (Lib Dem, N Norfolk) accused Cabinet ministers of \u0027dreadful hypocrisy\u0027, given that \u0027most of them, unless they were very odd people\u0027 had at one time smoked weed. Mr Javid stuck to his position that this was simply about medical uses for the drug.The positive medical effects of this long-overdue decision may be pretty immediate. The political effects? I suspect it will help the Tories to rebrand slightly, make them look a little less constipated. And it will give civil servants the screaming ab-dabs. They love, above all else, to obstruct by delay. Mr Javid just unblocked the sink a little. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/23/4D6C829D00000578-0-Sarah_Ferguson_shared_a_picture_of_daughters_Princess_Eugenie_an-m-20_1529448862135.jpg","title":"Instagram royalty Duke York Fergie Princess Eugenie share sweet family snaps Instagram","story":"    \u0027Happy Easter from the York sisters\u0027: Princess Eugenie shared a sweet snap of herself and her sister Beatrice in Easter bonnets          Sarah Ferguson shared a picture of daughters Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice on Mother\u0027s Day saying she was \u0027so thankful to have been blessed with amazing children\u0027          Sarah Ferguson posted an image of herself with daughter Princess Beatrice in February, who does not yet have her own Instagram accountAndrew the protocol buster...            Princess Eugenie celebrated The Queen\u0027s birthday and congratulated her father on his first Trooping of the Colour as Colnel of the Grenadier Guards           Sarah Ferguson shared a throwback snap of Prince Andrew on his birthday on February 19          Prince Andrew, The Duke of York, shared an image of when he was a cub scout in the First Marylebone Scout and Cub Pack in 1968          HRH The Duke of York shared a Royal selfie from April which was shared with dozens of people in the background at the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs Eugenie\u0027s endless childhood snaps...

Human Rights Council saying it had \u0027chronic\u0027 bias against Israel and had members who themselves violated human rights          Conflict: Nikki Haley accused the organization of \u0027chronic bias\u0027 against Israel, whose human rights record in the West bank and Gaza (pictured) is the only issue on the agenda at every meeting          Condemnation: The Trump administration\u0027s move to leave the body came a day after it condemned the separation of children from their parents when they cross the border illegally Pompeo said there was no doubt that the council once had a \u0027noble vision.\u0027\u0027But today we need to be honest,\u0027 he said. \u0027The Human Rights Council is a poor defender of human rights.\u0027  \u0027Countries have colluded with each other to undermine the current method of selecting members,\u0027 Pompeo said.\u0027And the council\u0027s continued and well-documented bias against Israel is unconscionable,\u0027 he said.\u0027Since its creation, the council has adopted more resolutions condemning Israel than against the rest of the world combined.\u0027The move extends a broader Trump administration pattern of stepping back from international agreements and forums under the president\u0027s \u0027America First\u0027 policy.Since taking office, the administration has announced its withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, the U.N. educational and cultural organization and the Iran nuclear deal. Other contentious moves have included slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum against key trading partners, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u0027s capital and moving the U.S. Embassy to the holy city from Tel Aviv.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli\u0027s prime minister, hailed the move on twitter , saying it showed \u0027enough is enough\u0027.And a statement from Netanyahu\u0027s office said the council \u0027has proven to be a biased, hostile, anti-Israel organization that has betrayed its mission of protecting human rights.\u0027 But the body\u0027s head, al-Hussein, said the decision was \u0027disappointing, if not really surprising news\u0027, adding: \u0027Given the state of #human rights in today\u0027s world, the U.S. should be stepping up, not stepping back.\u0027Opposition to the decision from human rights advocates was swift. A group of 12 organizations including Save the Children, Freedom House and the United Nations Association - USA said there were \u0027legitimate concerns\u0027 about the council\u0027s shortcomings but that none of them warranted a U.S. exit.Trump says the \u0027deep state\u0027 could be responsible for...Congressional intern yells \u0027Mr President f*** you\u0027 as Trump...FBI lover Peter Strzok is escorted OUT of the agency but...Ann Coulter doubles down on claims that crying children in...\u0027This is not my America\u0027: Stormy Daniels\u0027 lawyer volunteers...\u0027I was not taken from my parents\u0027: Actor George Takei says...Trump\u0027s deputy chief of staff is out: Joe Hagin to leave...\u0027Mothers fight for their children!\u0027 Guatemalan asylum-seeker...Share this article\u0027This decision is counterproductive to American national security and foreign policy interests and will make it more difficult to advance human rights priorities and aid victims of abuse around the world,\u0027 the organizations said in a joint statement.Added Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch: \u0027All Trump seems to care about is defending Israel.\u0027But the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank close to the Trump administration, defended the move, calling the council \u0027notably incurious about the human rights situations in some of the world\u0027s most oppressive countries.\u0027 Brett Schaefer, a senior fellow, pointed out that Trump could have withdrawn immediately after taking office but instead gave the council 18 months to make changes. Haley has been the driving force behind the move, which would be unprecedented in the 12-year history of the council. No country has ever dropped out voluntarily. Libya was kicked out seven years ago.The move could reinforce the perception that the Trump administration is seeking to advance Israel\u0027s agenda on the world stage, just as it prepares to unveil its long-awaited peace plan despite Palestinian outrage over the embassy relocation. Trump\u0027s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is visiting the Middle East this week as the White House works to lay the groundwork for unveiling the plan.Last year, Haley warned the Geneva-based council that the U.S. would withdraw if it did not end its systematic scrutiny of Israel and its alleged rights abuses against Palestinians.She denounced the council as a \u0027forum for politics, hypocrisy and evasion\u0027 and accused member countries such as Venezuela, Cuba, China, Burundi and Saudi Arabia of failing to fulfill their duties to \u0027uphold the highest standards\u0027 of human rights, while emphasizing what she said was the council\u0027s anti-Israel bias.Since last year, Haley\u0027s office has also pushed the council and its chief not to publish a U.N. database of companies operating in West Bank settlements, a so-called blacklist that Israel is concerned could drive companies away and cast a further pall over its presence in the Palestinian-claimed West Bank.          Reaction: Zeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein, United Nation High Commissioner for Human Rights tweeted: \u0027Given the state of #human rights in today\u0027s world, the U.S. should be stepping up, not stepping back.\u0027  A general view of the Human Rights Room (Room XX) at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. Diplomats say the United States is about to quit the United Nation\u0027s main human rights body, primarily over Washington\u0027s claim that the Human Rights Council is biased against IsraelIsrael is the only country in the world whose rights record comes up for discussion at every council session, under \u0027Item 7\u0027 on the agenda.The officials said the administration had concluded that its efforts to promote reform on the council had failed and that withdrawal was the only step it could take to demonstrate its seriousness. It was not immediately clear if the U.S. would remain a non-voting observer on the council.A full pullout by the U.S. would leave the council without one of its traditional defenders of human rights. In recent months, the United States has participated in attempts to pinpoint rights violations in places like South Sudan, Congo and Cambodia.There are 47 countries in the Human Rights Council, elected by the U.N.\u0027s General Assembly with a specific number of seats allocated for each region of the globe. Members serve for three-year terms and can only serve two terms in a row.The United States has opted to stay out of the Human Rights Council before: the administration of President George W. Bush did so when the council was created in 2006. Item 7 on \u0027Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories\u0027 has been part of the council\u0027s regular business almost as long as it has existed.A pullout could be largely symbolic: The United States\u0027 current term on the council ends next year, when it could revert to the observer status held by other countries that are not members. In that situation, the U.S. would be able to speak out on rights abuses, but not to vote.A key question will be where a U.S. pullout would leave Israel if its biggest and most powerful defender abandons its voting rights or drops out of the council altogether.The State Department\u0027s web site says protection of fundamental human rights was a \u0027foundation stone\u0027 for the United States\u0027 creation over two centuries ago and that promoting respect for human rights since has been a \u0027central goal\u0027 of U.S. foreign policy."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/19/4D690F1600000578-5861769-image-a-18_1529431282536.jpg","title":"Couple flying Birmingham Kos TUI wait 30 HOURS","story":"    Stranded: A couple sleeping together on the floor of Birmingham Airport after a flight was delayed for 30 hours When they arrived at Birmingham Airport at 2.30pm on Saturday they were warned by their operator TUI that there could be a delay of about 45 minutes to their 4.30pm flight.A flight from Norway had to make an emergency landing on the runway at Birmingham and caused significant delays as a result.Miss Poulson said she also understood that TUI had difficulty organising a captain and cabin crew for the delayed flight. The company has since admitted failing to properly take care of the stranded holidaymakers during the long delay.

Everyone was very distressed.\u0027\u0027Then, when we got to Birmingham Airport, the 10 disabled passengers were stuck for another two and a half hours.

For now, you should register your phone number with the Telephone Preference Service online at tpsonline.org.uk or by calling 0345 070 0707.Once your number is on this list it is illegal for companies to cold call and try to sell you something.If caught, firms face a fine of up to £500,000 by the watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office.However, signing up won\u0027t stop all nuisance calls.

Tap this, then the grey arrow in the top right — the list of options will include the choice to \u0027block this caller\u0027.You can also report text messages online to the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office at ico.org.uk or by calling 0303 123 1113.The watchdog will ask you a series of questions such as what the text was about, whether you had a previous relationship with the firm that contacted you, and if the message worried you.You do not have to answer all the questions, but the more detail you can give the better.You can also report nuisance calls this way.However, scammers typically use multiple numbers so it\u0027s difficult to stop all spam texts from getting through.Many junk texts include an option to reply \u0027STOP\u0027 to prevent further messages. If you do so the company is legally required to stop sending marketing texts.But only do this if you are sure the message is from a legitimate company, such as your mobile provider or another firm you have dealt with in the past.If you are in any doubt, ignore it. Replying just confirms to the firm that your phone is active and they may hound you all the more or sell your number on to other crooks.Watch out for messages that appear to come from your bank or the taxman.Fraudsters are able to make it appear as though their text messages have been sent from a legitimate company.These spoof messages are often very convincing because they appear in the same thread as other genuine texts.To be safe, never click on any link or call a number given to you in an unexpected text message — even if it claims your account has been suspended or blocked.If you have any concerns call the phone number on the back of your bank card or statement.HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs says it will never contact taxpayers about refunds or request personal details by text message.It advises people to forward any suspicious messages to 60599 (there may be a small charge if you do not have free text messages as part of your contract).                                                    If you think the call was from a fraudster, report it to Action Fraud at actionfraud.police.uk, or by phoning 0300 123 2040. Blocking phone numbers on a smartphone is also easy. If you have an iPhone, for example, tap on the green square icon with a picture of a phone to pull up your recent calls list.There will be a little blue circle with an \u0027i\u0027 for information next to the nuisance caller\u0027s number.Tap on this, scroll to the bottom of the list of options and select \u0027block this caller\u0027.You can also download the free TPS Protect app which will help identify different types of nuisance calls.If a number is in the app\u0027s database because it\u0027s been reported by another user, a message will pop up telling you what type of company is calling.For example, it might say \u0027insurance\u0027 or \u0027PPI\u0027. It will also tell you if the number is a \u0027suspected scam\u0027. You can then reject the call and use your phone\u0027s settings to block it for ever.You can also report numbers by filling out a few details on the app, which will help other users. Details of reported calls will be passed on to the watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office.The app also gives telephone numbers a \u0027trust score\u0027 of between one and five, where one is likely to be a scam and five a company with a low number of complaints.But these are not always accurate so stay vigilant.For 99p a month you can add numbers to an automatic block list so that your phone doesn\u0027t ring when they call.But remember, you can already do this for free as we explain above. With the more advanced version of the app you can also choose only to accept calls above a certain trust score.The app can\u0027t identify calls that come from a withheld number.Instead, you may want to decline them so they are erted to your voicemail.moneymail@dailymail.co.ukGood for big potsGood for big potsFee back in trades Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/15/438BF70800000578-0-image-m-36_1529332923560.jpg","title":"Gangs sell bank details passwords sites available simplest Google search","story":"    Experts called on Google to take down the forumsThe number of reported cases has soared by 125 per cent in the past decade, with almost 500 cases a day logged last year – a total of 175,000.The Cifas report found a full set of online bank details can be bought for as little as £161, credit card details for £56.50, and passport information for £40. This information is then used by identity fraudsters to take out genuine loans, mobile phone contracts and credit cards in someone else’s name. The criminals take the money and leave the victim with huge debts.Yesterday the Daily Mail found several forums littered with posts by fraudsters selling personal data.By putting into Google slang terms commonly used by online criminals to advertise the sale of stolen financial information, we found dozens of message boards.Many of them had been set up to discuss seemingly innocent topics such as handball, poker and Windsor Football Club. A post on the poker forum boasted the full personal details of a customer of the Co-operative Bank. It included the cardholder’s name, address and date of birth.Card numbers, email addresses, sort codes and account numbers, telephone numbers, card expiry dates and national insurance numbers were also found on these posts.On one website, we found a post by a hacker who claimed to have been stealing financial information for seven years. Last night, experts called on Google to take down the forums. Arun Chauhan, director of Tenet Compliance and Litigation, a law firm specialising in financial crime, said search engines such as Google had a ‘moral duty to step up and do something’.He added: ‘In the daily global fight against financial crime, it is crucial that banks and non-financial entities such as search engine providers that facilitate the passing and gathering of information and money take steps to prevent criminals from using them to commit fraud.’Angela Sasse, of the Research Institute in Science of Cyber Security, said: ‘If the details being shared are clearly only being used for criminal gain... the sensible thing would be to get the police involved to work with the search engines. Nazis head to Google Plus after Facebook and Twitter...Google is struggling to hold onto black and Hiic...Share this article\u0027It could be tempting for young people to get involved in this illegal activity. Once they know what they’re looking for, it’s easy to get drawn in.’For years, cyber security experts have found stolen personal data being traded on the so-called dark web – a network of hidden websites where users can remain anonymous. But Cifas, which was set up by high street banks to combat fraud, and Forensic Pathways, which provides software for criminal investigations, say fraudsters are now regularly posting stolen information on forums.          Google has claimed that it is not responsible for the information found on its search engineNeil Hare-Brown, a cyber security expert, said fraudsters had moved their illegal activities to online forums because they had much more exposure to potential buyers.He added: ‘The dark web puts a lot of buyers off. It’s really slow and difficult to navigate and fraudsters know they won’t get as many sales.’Search engines such as Google could flag the slang terms and prevent the illegal activity, he added.Google has come under fire for allowing jihadi videos on its YouTube website, for cashing in on fake ticket-selling websites and failing to delete racist material.It has claimed that it is not responsible for the information found on its search engine.A Google spokesman said: ‘When we receive reports of pages that distribute personal data to facilitate identity theft or fraud, we remove these from “search” – full stop.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/20/4D6A53DF00000578-0-image-m-25_1529437224834.jpg","title":"Why Britain given 1bn foreign aid brutal African regime","story":"    To his opponents Paul Kagame is a butcher and a war criminal who runs a brutal one-party state. Paranoid and convinced that coup plotters are everywhere, he regularly purges loyalists in the armyThe woman they arrested is Diane Rwigara, daughter of a wealthy Rwandan businessman, who was educated in Belgium before achieving a masters at San Francisco State University and taking up a teaching post at the Ivy League Stanford University.Diane returned home to Rwanda last year, but any prospects of a glittering future are now gone. She had been harassed for months, with police calling at her door in the middle of the night and her phones tapped, before she ‘disappeared’ at the end of last September.Diane’s house has been seized by the government and is being put up for auction. A commercial property, a factory and flats she owned have been knocked down. Her life savings of £250,000 were stolen by the police who arrested her. Fake nude photographs of her were posted on the internet.This week, as I drove past where one of Diane’s properties once stood, my Rwandan companion whispered that the bulldozers moved in to send a message: ‘The president is saying: we will crush you, and the grass will grow and no one will remember you were ever alive.’Her crime? She tried to stand against Rwanda’s president Paul Kagame in elections, calling for an end to his reign of murder, looting and tyranny. That was a mistake for which she is paying dearly. This week, Diane is spending her 268th night behind bars in the hellish Mageragere Prison, a place so terrifying that my driver would only take me within half a mile for fear we would be spotted and thrown inside.The man who put her there is a stick-thin teetotaller and erstwhile close friend of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who calls him a ‘visionary’.Cherie Blair, meanwhile, in her professional capacity as a barrister, was instructed to defend Kagame’s feared spy chief, who is wanted for questioning about the murder of a British aid worker.At one time, Kagame gave Blair the use of his Bombardier private jet to travel around Africa.Why IS banned ex-FIFA boss Sepp Blatter at the World Cup?...Share this articleYet to his opponents Kagame is a butcher and a war criminal who runs a brutal one-party state. Paranoid and convinced that coup plotters are everywhere, he regularly purges loyalists in the army.Now, the world will be hearing more of this dictator following the announcement that Arsenal, one of the world’s most famous football clubs, has struck a deal to market his country on their shirts with global television audiences of hundreds of millions.In return for the cash, Arsenal’s players will bear the legend ‘Visit Rwanda’ against a pink backdrop on one sleeve of their iconic red-and-white shirts. Kagame hopes TV viewers will flock to his country.Such is the tyrant’s interest in football that he was to be found this week in Moscow attending the World Cup, where he was warmly greeted by Vladimir Putin.Diane Rwigara is unlikely to be celebrating the news of the Arsenal sponsorship. Mageragere Prison sits on an isolated peak deep in the remote countryside. Here, Rwanda’s Alcatraz is surrounded by watch towers with armed guards and a forbidding wall with razor wire and electric fences. Nobody has ever escaped.          He was credited with ending the genocide that saw almost one million people die during a 100-day orgy of violence against his own Tutsi tribe and moderate Hutus by rival Hutu extremists. But according to a UN report, after the civil war he sent his men on a psychopathic pogrom against the Hutus (pictured: bones excavated from a mass grave after the genocide)Inside is a place of horror. The prison was relocated here from the centre of Kigali because screams from prisoners and the stink of excrement were embarrassing the president, who has spent millions on public relations experts to burnish his image.The location may be new — but the brutality remains the same. Beatings, mock executions and widespread sexual abuse of female inmates are a way of life. In a searing report, Human Rights Watch investigators uncovered evidence last year of the scale of the abuse, which includes guards forcing inmates to fight each other for their enjoyment.Kagame — referred to in Rwanda as the ‘darling dictator’ due to attempts by the rich and powerful to curry his favour — tells anyone who will listen that he has transformed his country since his forces invaded in 1994 from neighbouring Uganda.He was credited with ending the genocide that saw almost one million people die during a 100-day orgy of violence against his own Tutsi tribe and moderate Hutus by rival Hutu extremists.Kagame was fawned over by Western politicians. But according to a UN report, after the civil war he sent his men on a psychopathic pogrom against the Hutus. (Kagame’s government dismissed the UN report as ‘outrageous’.)Hidden from prying eyes, Rwandan forces are accused of hunting down Hutus, chasing two million into neighbouring countries, killing tens of thousands and triggering a humanitarian crisis.While other infamous African dictators such as Uganda’s Idi Amin and Mobutu Sese Seko, of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), were lunatics, Kagame is a more clever and devious despot.‘The centre point to his policy is convincing everyone that he is a good guy who provides street lights and is doing his utmost to transform Rwanda,’ one Western diplomat told me. ‘But the reality is he is doing his utmost to transform his own finances and cling to power at all costs.’As well as vast wealth derived from the mineral riches to be found in neighbouring countries, Kagame also controls almost every aspect of business life in Rwanda.So why on earth has Rwanda been given almost £1 billion of UK taxpayers’ money via foreign aid over the past decade?The funding was part of David Cameron’s plan to detoxify the Tory Party. Yet, as long ago as 2010, warnings were sounded about Kagame’s barbaric regime.At a meeting in Whitehall to plan Cameron’s first trip to Africa after becoming Prime Minister, he was urged not to visit Rwanda or meet Kagame because of the human rights abuses. Cameron decided to go anyway, thinking it would look good if he was seen to be helping a small African country devastated and torn apart by the genocide.The aid gravy train for Kagame ran into problems in 2012 when Rwandan-backed rebels wreaked havoc in the neighbouring Congo, raping and murdering, with reports of mothers being forced to kill their own babies by pounding them into pieces in large bowls used for grinding corn into flour.Britain suspended its aid programme briefly in 2012 — then reinstated it. Today, Kagame is still active in Congo, plundering minerals and funding militias, while for all the donor cash pouring into Rwanda, more than half the population live on less than £1 a day, and famine is widespread.Despite that, Kagame’s regime has now found the money to spend £25 million on sponsoring Arsenal.One man less than enamoured to hear about the deal is Will Turnbull, who lives just a few miles from Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium. His brother Graham, a UN worker, was in Rwanda probing atrocities by Kagame when he was murdered by the new Arsenal sponsor’s regime. The man named as Graham’s killer was Karenzi Karake, Kagame’s spy chief.          Pictured: Diane Rwigara, who was arrested for trying to stand against Kagame in elections, and calling for an end to his reign of murder, looting and tyrannyYet after Karake was arrested during a trip to London and accused of the killing of civilians, Cherie Blair was hired to represent him and used legal arguments to prevent him being extradited to Spain to face other charges over the deaths of three Spanish aid workers.‘The multi-million-pound deal with Arsenal is nothing short of a self-indulgent vanity project,’ Will Turnbull told me. ‘Yet again Kagame is short-changing his people for his own ends. It is shameful he is allowed to act unopposed both at home and abroad.‘Is it not time the UK and other European nations stood up against this desperate regime and offered assistance to Rwanda’s people?’For their part, in a statement to the Mail, Arsenal said: ‘Rwanda has transformed itself dramatically in recent times and is now regarded as one of the most advanced and respected countries in Africa. This is one of the reasons we believe that, having conducted due diligence, it is a partnership that will help Rwanda meet their tourism goals while developing football in the country.‘Tourism is one of Rwanda’s fastest-growing and biggest industries. It has helped dramatically reduce the country’s reliance on foreign aid, whilst significantly contributing to the GDP and employment of Rwanda, and this partnership is intended to accelerate these benefits.‘The partnership is with The Rwanda Development Board and focused on driving awareness of what Rwanda has to offer as a tourist destination to millions of people around the world.’Of the 1.4 million tourists Kagame claims visit the country every year, Rwanda admits that only 92,000 people were from the U.S. and Europe. The larger figure includes those returning from neighbouring African nations.In fairness to Arsenal, carrying out ‘due diligence’ is tricky, as I discovered. The regime regularly jails journalists, and few foreign reporters are allowed in, apart from travel writers invited to extol the natural beauty of the country and its population of rare mountain gorillas.Investigative journalists do not prosper here: hit squads have killed two of the country’s best reporters, shooting them in the head at separate locations and dumping their bodies by the road.There is no free Press. The internet and social media are monitored. Websites are regularly blocked. In 2012, the BBC was banned after airing a documentary challenging Kagame’s version of life in Rwanda.A vast flow of aid has certainly transformed the capital, which is marketing itself as the ‘convention centre’ of Africa, with expensive hotels bustling with diplomats and officials from governments and charities around the world.Yet the majority of ordinary Rwandans face a daily nightmare just to survive. The scale of woe was evident this week when I visited Kimisagara, an overcrowded slum on the outskirts of the capital where life is wretched, with disease and poverty rife.There seemed little evidence of any aid money being spent to ease their plight. A doctor at one crumbling clinic, where locals have to pay 50p per visit (almost half of the average daily income), told me that typhoid, malaria and chronic diarrhoea were commonplace.When asked what the cash given to Arsenal by his government could do for the poor and ill, this medic smiled apologetically and said carefully: ‘It’s the president’s choice how he wants to spend the money. I hope it’s a good thing. We trust our president.’          Now, the world will be hearing more of this dictator following the announcement that Arsenal, one of the world’s most famous football clubs, has struck a deal to market his country on their shirts with global television audiences of hundreds of millions (pictured with former Arsenal player Tony Adams)At a bar nearby, a group of men playing pool on a torn, rickety table — all ardent football fans — laughed bitterly at the largesse given by Rwanda to a rich, world-famous football club.‘It’s the president — what can we say,’ one told me, smiling weakly. ‘We don’t have anything here — no work, no money, no nothing. We don’t have lives.’Kagame has spies everywhere. Each village has an agent working for the regime, who must report daily with details of every aspect of life among the locals — from mundane matters such as gossip about affairs, to listening in for any plots against a man his loyalists call Number One.Nor are critics safe abroad. Kagame’s directorate of military intelligence has been blamed for a number of killings of defectors overseas, including the strangling of a former spy chief in a South African hotel room.Paul Charles, a former BBC newsreader, acts for Kagame from his offices in London’s Notting Hill. In a series of emails to me, he denied the regime has wasted millions on public relations to burnish its image. ‘First, president Kagame is not personally sponsoring his favourite football club,’ he stated.‘The contract with Arsenal is with the Rwanda Development Board, which is responsible for promoting and marketing tourism and business investment into Rwanda.‘Its marketing budget for the Arsenal partnership is totally separate to foreign aid received, which is spent on local projects with approval of the UK Government.’Mr Charles refused to comment on the plight of Diane Rwigara, saying that it was a matter for the Rwandan government. We asked the Rwandan authorities a series of questions about abuses uncovered during my investigation, but they also declined to comment.Back in one of Kigali’s slums — where mud-built houses have been marked with crosses for demolition so high-rise apartments can be built for the ruling elite — a man named Michael was convinced that Arsenal would soon be seen playing at Kigali International Stadium.‘Even if I have to pay back the money for all my life, I’m going to get a ticket and see them,’ he beamed.I didn’t have the heart to tell him that Arsenal will not be coming. The club told me: ‘No, the players won’t come. Rwanda gets the exposure through our shirt, space on matchday advertising boards and players will be involved in tourism campaigns.’As I walked the streets of Kigali, along pavements built with aid money, I pondered whether perhaps Arsenal’s stars should wear two armbands: ‘Visit Rwanda’ in pink on one sleeve, and on the other a photo of the imprisoned Diane Rwigara, to commemorate all those kidnapped, tortured and murdered by their rich new sponsor’s appalling regime. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/01/4D68028800000578-5863169-image-m-4_1529454933357.jpg","title":"Hunt Javid decisive duo taking procrastinating Mrs May","story":"    Sajid Javid announced – he yapped it out – the likely and swift legalisation of medicinal cannabis in Parliament We have told her to act, pronto, to respond to these prominent stories about youngsters who need cannabis for medical treatment (Mr Hunt\u0027s presence seemed to say). And when it comes to replacing her as Tory leader, both of us fancy our chances.Mr Javid spoke with his usual staccato rasp.

Or a politician who, at last, alleluia, is prepared to scythe through some of Whitehall\u0027s knots and actually get something done? Or both?For decades, Whitehall has slowed political change to the speed of a glacier. Some will say that is because the brilliance of our unwritten constitution is that it prevents hot-heads from making revolutionary changes. Others will say it is because Whitehall likes to retain the power and therefore blunts politicians\u0027 promises of action.Look at politicians\u0027 attempts to stop vexatious prosecutions of British Armed Forces veterans. Look at proposals to reduce death duties. Look at the time spent on the Iraq inquiry. Look at Brexit. All have been paralysed by officialdom.Mr Javid, king the English language, was breaking the inevitable Whitehall review into two parts. The first would be run by chief medical officer Sally Davies. The second would be run by the (vast) advisory council on the misuse of drugs.           Javid was so over-excited at the start of his Statement yesterday that he swallowed half the syllables in the word \u0027efficacy\u0027Mr Javid said Prof Davies could do her review work in a week.

Someone mentioned that Lord Hague was calling for the legalisation of all cannabis. \u0027He\u0027s wrong!\u0027 shouted Simon Hoare (Con, N Dorset).Norman Lamb (Lib Dem, N Norfolk) accused Cabinet ministers of \u0027dreadful hypocrisy\u0027, given that \u0027most of them, unless they were very odd people\u0027 had at one time smoked weed. Mr Javid stuck to his position that this was simply about medical uses for the drug.The positive medical effects of this long-overdue decision may be pretty immediate. The political effects? I suspect it will help the Tories to rebrand slightly, make them look a little less constipated. And it will give civil servants the screaming ab-dabs.

She had illegally crossed the Rio Grande on a raft to reach TexasIn May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 policy in which all those apprehended entering the US illegally, including those seeking asylum, would be criminally charged, which generally leads to children being separated from their parents.On Friday, it was revealed that nearly 2,000 children were separated from adults at the border between mid-April and the end of May.Those children are now living in detention centers along the US-Mexico border.Trump\u0027s policy has drawn condemnation from medical professionals, religious leaders, and immigration activists, who warn that some children could suffer lasting psychological trauma. It has since been revealed that Trump administration officials are sending babies and other young children forcibly separated from their parents to at least three \u0027tender age\u0027 shelters in South Texas.Lawyers and medical providers who have visited the Rio Grande Valley shelters described play rooms of crying preschool-age children in crisis.The government also plans to open a fourth shelter to house hundreds of young migrant children in Houston, where city leaders denounced the move Tuesday. Meanwhile, NBC has reported that a new desert tent city is reportedly preparing for more than 4,000 children and plans to house 20 to a tent.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fa585f2edb8c379be18b04a5d95ecffd078e6d8/0_0_2785_3543/master/2785.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=53e11de648227e763ef8c6c78bd58ea1 1400w","title":"the inner level review","story":"The authors of the influential study The Spirit Level, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, extend their exploration to inidual health and happinessIn a recent episode of the TV drama Billions, the antihero Bobby Axelrod is talking to a rival hedge fund manager who is going to have to “close his shop”. “How much are you walking away with,” Axelrod asks. Forty million dollars, the guy says. And then Axelrod details for him all the expenses of his lifestyle, in excruciating detail, implying that $40m won’t be nearly enough. “You’re right,” the guy eventually says in shock. “I’m broke.”You couldn’t ask for a better illustration of the truth that we feel rich or otherwise not according to any objective measure, but in comparison with how our peers are doing. And vast disparities of wealth in any society just make things worse. In their influential 2009 book The Spirit Level, the epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett demonstrated conclusively the pernicious effects of economic inequality. In more unequal countries, outcomes are worse for almost everyone in areas such as public health, education, obesity and social mobility. Their new book, more a companion volume than a sequel, concentrates on the doleful psychic effects of inequality on iniduals.It turns out that pretty much everything you can think of is worse in more unequal countries (such as the UK and the US), compared with the least unequal ones (Norway, Finland and Japan). We’re more prone to chronic stress, anxiety, depression, addiction, unnecessary spending and ruinous gambling. Remarkably, people of lower status in hierarchies have higher levels in their blood of a clotting factor called fibrinogen, implying that their bodies are constantly on high alert to heal potential wounds. Advertisers, we learn, spend less money in more equal societies, such as Denmark, because their citizens are less motivated by status purchasing. In the most unequal societies, by contrast, people are more prone to “a defensive, narcissistic presentation of self”: we risk, it seems, creating a society of mini-Trumps all clawing at one another’s hairpieces.Much of the heavy lifting of analysis and argument has already been done in the previous book, and this one contains more opinion, speculation and arguable interpretation of evidence, as the authors wander off briefly into different fields of inquiry. Anthropological evidence that hunter-gatherer societies are surprisingly egalitarian, for instance, is argued to demonstrate that it is not “human nature” for us to be competitive and hierarchical. The authors make much of “stereotype threat” – the idea that being reminded you are old, or of an ethnic minority, makes you perform worse in tests – without noting that, as with so much in social psychology, recent attempts to reproduce such results have signally failed.Wilkinson and Pickett also try very hard to downplay the current, robust evidence that intelligence is partly inherited, which you don’t really have to do in order to make the (correct) point that family and school environments play a very large role in cognitive development. At one peculiar point, they even appear to suggest that rock music is better than modern classical music because it doesn’t give people class anxiety.For all the power of the book’s data and charts the reader may remain unconvinced that inequality explains everything bad, and greater equality explains everything good, about happiness levels in different countries. Reducing inequality, nonetheless, seems like a good idea. How to do it? Redistributive tax regimes, the authors think, are insufficient, since they can always be overturned by the next government. Instead they champion the co-operative (John Lewis) model for workers, as well as mandatory employee representation on company boards, rising over time to give them full control. But this won’t suffice. Not just inequality but the “market economy” itself is blamed for making everyone unhappy, even though Finland and Norway are also market economies, so this cannot be a general explanation of our woes either. The authors think economic growth should be halted in the rich countries, since increasing material wealth no longer makes us feel better. This recommendation isn’t quite squared away with one justification given for employee ownership of companies, which is that they allegedly have “higher productivity”. There’s not much point increasing productivity if you are anti-growth.But, the authors argue, capitalism also needs to be overthrown because climate change demands a social revolution along more egalitarian, “sustainable” lines. Business as usual, they say, is not an option, echoing Naomi Klein’s argument in her 2014 eco-socialist manifesto, This Changes Everything. As with Klein’s book, this nice rhetoric is a bit woolly, and short on persuasive details of how a zero-carbon, zero-growth nirvana may be achieved. In the meantime, advances in solar and other renewable energies will very likely continue to be made by people trying – among other things – to get rich."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba4f07a842c28bca606a50d7664c922de474fa42/0_236_3744_2245/master/3744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62302e8d7d3066bbcb7107035db7f138","title":"labour to propose bank of england remit to boost productivity","story":"John McDonnell will call for major changes to UK’s financial system based on broad reviewThe Bank of England could be given a mandate to boost productivity growth under a Labour government as part of opposition plans to overhaul the country’s “economic architecture”.Revealing the findings from a review of the UK financial system, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will on Wednesday make the case for a fundamental transformation that could include a revamp of the Bank’s remit in order to help drive economic growth. Referring to the need for greater productivity across the economy, McDonnell will say: “Our financial system right now isn’t fit for this purpose. We need one that helps to deliver enough investment in the high-technology industries and firms so that we can reboot and rebuild Britain. This report is a vital part in making this happen.”Under options being considered by the party before the next election, Threadneedle Street would cooperate with the government on meeting a productivity target, move some of its operations to Birmingham, and steer high street banks towards lending in productive sectors, such as manufacturing and IT. The proposals come amid a slowdown in business investment across the UK in the wake of the Brexit referendum. This threatens to further exacerbate the weak recovery of growth in productivity – economic output per hour worked – since the financial crisis of 2008. Productivity is considered important because if workers produce more in a shorter space of time, it paves the way for pay increases and a rise in wealth.The report, compiled by the economist Graham Turner, of the consultancy GFC Economics, argues that too much high-street bank lending flows into “fundamentally speculative activities” rather than productive investment, making the situation worse.McDonnell will point to investment in new technologybeing concentrated in London and the south-east, and to Britain’s position of having the lowest rate of investment in the G7. He will say the policies of the Conservatives have led to real wages being lower now than they were in 2010, with the UK having gone through the slowest decade of productivity growth since the Napoleonic wars ended in the early 19th century. “We’ve seen more and more investment flowing into property speculation whilst hi-tech firms have been starved of the money they need, and research spending has lagged far behind,” he will say. However, the measures could raise eyebrows among some economists, with steps for boosting productivity typically reserved for the Treasury, which is controlled by elected officials rather than senior Bank staff. There could also be questions about the best way to measure productivity, with economists debating whether the weak progress of the past decade has been overstated. Other measures suggested by the Turner review include some put forward by Labour previously, including moving parts of the Bank to Birmingham, as well as the government retaining a stake in Royal Bank of Scotland in order to boost lending to small businesses. Labour would also establish a strategic investment board to deliver productive investment, and a national investment bank to focus on lending to regions outside London.

Bithumb said in a notice on its website that it had stopped all trading after ascertaining “some cryptocurrencies worth about 35 billion won were seized between late yesterday and early morning today”. The exchange, the sixth busiest in the world according to Coinmarketcap, said it had stored all clients’ assets in “safe cold wallets” – which operate on platforms not directly connected to the internet. It added that the company would fully compensate customers. The Bithumb theft highlights the security risks and the weak regulation of global cryptocurrency markets. Global policymakers have warned investors to be cautious in trading the digital currency, given the lack of broad regulatory oversight. In Ho, a professor at Korea University’s Blockchain Research Institute, said the stolen coins were most likely to be from the more insecure ’hot wallets’. “Since coins in the cold wallets are not at all wired to the internet, it would have been impossible for hackers to steal those in cold wallets unless they physically broke in,” said In, a blockchain expert at the research centre. Bithumb did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comments and its statement did not say whether the stolen coins were stored in its “hot wallets”. Mun Chong-hyun, the chief analyst at ESTsecurity, said digital coins would continue to be targets for hackers around the world. On 11 June, another South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, Coinrail, said it was hacked. The cyber-attacks come after a high-profile theft of more than half a billion dollars-worth of digital currency at Japan’s exchange Coincheck earlier this year.In January, South Korea banned the use of anonymous bank accounts for virtual coin trading to stop cryptocurrencies being used in money-laundering and other crimes. However, the government said it did not intend to go as far as shutting down domestic exchanges. Bithumb trades more than 37 different virtual coins, according to Coinmarketcap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f695eddf29a865d4d3573a17cfbb39d83021f0ed/110_0_5565_3341/master/5565.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bedb415f6f8784a0714b90dc17326aa","title":"welcome to brumbria should the west midlands become a national park","story":"Could a plan to turn the West Midlands into a national park transform the Black Country’s unlovely reputation, asks Wolverhampton native Stuart Jeffries “I think we have an extraordinary landscape here waiting to be discovered by millions,” says landscape architect Kathryn Moore, unrolling a jauntily coloured map of her visionary new park in a Birmingham City University office. The professor isn’t talking about of Cumbria, Umbria, Snowdonia or Amazonia. She’s talking about the touristic potential of the West Midlands plateau, the heart of England that threw itself into the fiery crucible of the Industrial Revolution and still bears sacrificial scars. It is here that Professor Moore wants to create the United Kingdom’s 16th national park.In the 19th century, Queen Victoria would lower the blinds on the royal train so she didn’t have to see the smokestack hell of the Black Country. Tolkien was inspired to create Mordor from nocturnal visions of its blast furnaces. If Moore has her way, though, in a decade or so Queen Kate will raise the blinds as the HS2 train passes the reconfigured Tame Valley between Birmingham and Coventry. “Look!” she’ll exclaim to King William. “What a vista of allotments, fisheries, fields, orchards, forests, hi-tech agriculture, green industries, creative hubs and cycle paths!” She’ll gaze in admiration at how the Tame has been rerouted using water from Birmingham city centre’s aquifer, all crisscrossed by new footbridges linking together suburbs long isolated by the city’s motorised arterial routes.And finally, as the train makes its approach to Philip Hardwick’s recently reopened grade I-listed, Roman-inspired, 1838 Curzon Street rail terminus, King William too will look out of the window. “Gosh!” he’ll exclaim. “Is that the famous Birmingham Central Park?”I know what you’re thinking. Make the Black Country green? Royal trains that stop in Birmingham?Understandably, Moore is steeling herself for the derision she’s going to get for daring to suggest the West Midlands might become green and pleasant. “Everybody talks about how this landscape is ugly or whatever,” she says. “But we can give it a new identity, and in so doing reimagine what it is to live in cities in a way that lives up to UN sustainable development goals.” Not since Mayor Joseph Chamberlain sought to make Birmingham the new Athens at the end of the 19th century has anyone round here dared to dream this big. On Thursday, Moore will unveil her plans for a new national park for the West Midlands at a conference in Birmingham. Last month, environment secretary Michael Gove asked if there is scope to expand the current network of national parks. Moore’s plans are a response to Gove’s invitation for ideas: a new vision for what a national park could be. Forget about trying to find new forests, coastlines or ancient wildernesses, Moore suggests: let’s re-green the West Midlands instead. “Birmingham was once famous as the city of a thousand trades,” she says. “Imagine if it became famous as the city of a thousand cycle and footpaths, a thousand parks and a thousand lakes.”Maybe she’s imagining a West Midlands akin to the post-apocalyptic England imagined in nature writer Richard Jefferies 19th-century novel After London, in which cities revert to nature – and the few survivors to a quasi-medieval way of life? “Not at all!” protests Moore. “I love cities, but I want to give them a better 21st century identity so they’re better to live in, more productive as well as more attractive.” Consider, for example, what’s wrong with suburban lawns. “If you look at wartime maps or aerial photos you’ll see that the landscape was used in a very different way. I want to bring back agriculture to the West Midlands, in part to increase food security. I want to create a new connection between the communities and the countryside people here haven’t experienced for decades.”Among the conference speakers will be James Corner, the landscape architect who changed perceptions of what cities could be like when he created a linear park from an abandoned elevated railway line in inner New York City and called it the High Line.Moore wants to do something similar, but with a twist. Instead of repurposing an abandoned railway, she plans to use a new one – the HS2 from London to Birmingham – as a catalyst. “It’s had so much bad publicity, but now we want to use the arrival of HS2 to create a better, greener West Midlands.” Moore serves on HS2’s design panel and hopes just as Birmingham led the world with the industrial revolution, it will lead the world in reimagining how an urban landscape can be married to a new notion of the countryside: a post-industrial revolution. Her proposal also aims to capitalise on Coventry becoming UK city of culture in 2021, and Birmingham hosting the Commonwealth Games in 2022. “The point is to harness all that energy to create something lasting that improves the quality of life of people here.” East London’s award-winning Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park was part of the legacy of the 2012 Olympics, and in that sense was something of a precursor for what she wants to achieve here. “The park would focus on encouraging active healthy lives and and wellbeing.”Moore’s national park proposal blames traditional development practices for long-term social, economic and environmental damage. Birmingham in particular and the West Midlands in general have long been considered proof of such blindness. Herbert Manzoni, Birmingham’s city engineer and surveyor, was in the 1960s and 70s what Baron Haussmann was to Paris a century before, building arterial routes and ring roads no matter what the cost to communities or aesthetics. The city became known for its underpasses filled with bad smells and worse buskers, while above traffic often as not sat in rush-hour gridlock. Manzoni created roads for drivers to sit in their private little boxes but neglected public spaces where you might want to walk or sit without having to cough up for a coffee. Moore’s proposals for a national park are an elegant counter to that car-based, free-market, environment-despoiling ideology. The worst aspect of what Manzoni did to the heart of England, Moore thinks, is that his roads carved up poorer neighbourhoods and made them more deprived as a result. “If you look at the map of multiple deprivation in the West Midlands,” she explains, “you’ll see how deprived communities are often ringed by roads that are hard to cross. They can’t get out of their neighbourhoods very easily to get to work or to education. The roads that were meant to connect people actually serve to leave some behind.”She has a point. Before meeting Moore, I get the 67 bus along the Tyburn and and Lichfield Roads, a route which goes through some of east Birmingham’s most deprived areas. Sue, a nurse heading home to Pype Hayes after her shift tells me she thinks estates like hers have been neglected by planners for too long. “Castle Vale and Chelmsley Wood, and lots of other estates in the West Midlands are cut off from the rest off the city by the M6 and by the big main roads. They become ghettoes. Your professor’s dead right about that and something needs to be done.” But she’s sceptical about plans for a national park. “People have always had big ideas for how to improve Birmingham,” she says. Fair point: I remember interviewing Birmingham council leader Mike Whitby in 2010 when he told me he thought the new central library might be better known as “a palazzo of human thought”. “But they always come unstuck when it comes to money,” says Sue. Again, fair point: that glamorous new library’s opening hours have been reduced because of council cuts. Potential sources of funding for Moore’s national park include the Department for Transport, the Environment Agency, Natural England, the Canal and River Trust and the Maria Nobrega Foundation. Later I ask a group of criminology students picnicking outside Birmingham’s Thinktank science museum if they like the idea of a Central Park over the wastelands they can glimpse from their flats. “I’d certainly like to stay here if it was a little less harsh and had more public parks,” says one. “I can imagine making a good life in this city if it wasn’t just for people with cars and lots of money,” says another. “I like the idea of having a national park on your doorstep and I suspect it would increase tourism.” What should it be called? “Heartlandia,” suggests one. “Mordor 2.0,” offers another. I’d like to see it called Brumbria, and picture tourists wondering why this looks nothing like Assisi or Keswick.Back in Birmingham City University, Moore explains that a tourism bump is certainly part of her agenda, but so is developing new skills in sectors that the West Midlands has hardly been known for in recent years – such as agriculture, horticulture, food production. “The park would boost the economy because it would make it more attractive for people to want to live here and that would make it more attractive for business.” No wonder, perhaps, that support for her project comes from Andy Street, former head of John Lewis and now the West Midlands’ first elected mayor, as well as Meriden MP Dame Caroline Spelman – the latter in part wooed by Moore’s idea that the Forest of Arden should be extended as part of the project. But Moore admits to dodging the question when I ask her if planners for the West Midlands are all behind her scheme. Perhaps just as importantly, Moore is hoping to reveal the West Midlands’ forgotten identity to its nearly three million inhabitants. To emphasise the point, she shows me two more maps. One is an recent Ordnance Survey map of the county with multicoloured roads and grey built-up zones, the other a relief map from the mid-19th century. Her point is that today most West Midlands citizens map their native land through its roads, not through its natural landscape – its rivers in particular. Her Brummie husband, she tells me, did not know that his home city was built on a plateau, still less could he point out where the area’s many rivers – the Tame, Rae, Blythe and Stour among them – flow. Like everybody round here, he knows that Birmingham has more miles of canals than Venice and more trees than Paris, but that’s not the kind of landscape his wife has in mind. “The plans I’m creating involve inverting maps. Traditionally the maps of the region highlight roads and building infrastructure. The ones I’ve drawn up highlight the contours of the landscape, the rivers and the green parts. I want to make people here proud of where they’re from. Not just because of the industrial heritage but because of the landscape that made that industry possible.”I look out of the window from Moore’s office, past the railway tracks, terraced roofs, abandoned factories and run-down pubs, wondering if in my lifetime the West Midlands National Park will join the Yorkshire Dales, the Pembrokeshire Coast, the Lake District and the Cairngorms as one of the precious, beautiful parts of Britain. “It’s all about changing perceptions,” says Moore.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed635e42f15d036abee586fc224300e33da3a85/0_50_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75bb38d5cc42faca4b70d6ed3a5eb856","title":"britain investment revolution labour party","story":"All new governments must be obliged to set productivity targets with a revamped Bank of England, and act on themThe last eight years has been a period of almost unparalleled waste and destructiveness in British economic policy. Even the prime minister now admits that the NHS has been damaged by the austerity spending cuts. But the problems with our economy run deeper than brutal political choices to prioritise tax giveaways for the super-rich and giant corporations over spending on public services. They run even deeper than the uncertainty and damage being inflicted by this government’s bungling of Brexit.This country suffers the lowest rate of investment in the G7. Our infrastructure – the essential networks of transport, utilities and telecommunications – is creaking under the strain, and suffering from decades of privatised mismanagement. On technology, we are falling even further behind, with the latest Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures showing that British manufacturing has the lowest rate of industrial robot use in the developed world – even allowing for the small size of the sector – and spending by business on research is far below the OECD average. Real wages remain lower than they were eight years ago. Yet amid the public squalor and worsening conditions for the many, there are huge new investments in luxury flats and, at least in parts of London, extraordinary private wealth.When I asked a respected City economist, Graham Turner, and his team to take a look into the functioning of the finance system, it was with this fundamental problem of low investment in mind. Their interim report, published in December, drummed home some startling facts. Our financial system was taking money from manufacturing and lending it to invest in property promising growth in new tech sectors was overwhelmingly concentrated in and around London and some of the issues we saw in the run-up to the financial crisis have still not gone away.Along with other detailed proposals, including the creation of a dedicated applied scientific research fund and a Strategic Investment Board to oversee investment, the authors’ aim is guided by the belief – entirely correct, in my view – that almost a decade after the global financial crisis caused the worst recession in living memory, the time for a fundamental transformation of our financial system is long overdue. It means building on the immense strengths of our financial system, and harnessing them to meet the needs of a productive economy that works for the many, not the few."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12bacf90173a4e95e506c0efb59958b3533c42d6/0_1161_5510_3306/master/5510.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7c44f4e7c2dfe55e48039d19d16d961","title":"ordinary people learn economics manchester classes","story":"In Manchester, groundbreaking economics courses are giving locals the means to challenge some of society’s received wisdom – for free. • Listen to Aditya Chakrabortty talking about game-changing economic models on The Alternatives podcastIn a makeshift classroom, nine lay people are battling some of the greatest economists of all time – and they appear to be winning. Just watch what happens to David Ricardo, the 18th-century father of our free-trade system. In best BBC voice, one of the group reads out Ricardo’s words: “Economics studies how the produce of the Earth is distributed.”Not good enough, says another, Brigitte Lechner. Shouldn’t economists study how to meet basic needs? “We all need a roof over our heads, we all need to survive.” Nor does the Earth belong solely to humans. Her judgment is brisk. “Ricardo was talking tosh.”So much laughter rings out of this room that the folk outside must wonder what’s going on. They’ve been told this is an economics course – and participants on those don’t normally dissolve into giggles.Inside, Pat Bhatt chimes in: “Everything you see around you comes from nature. That’s the basis of everything. Economics is the wrong word. It should be … ecolo-mics.”Ooohs and aaahs. “Very clever!” beams the facilitator Nicola Headlam and scribbles it down on the flipboard.“My work here is done,” replies Headlam. “I’ll get my\u0026nbspcoat.”Some days, democracy looks like a bashed-up ballot box. Some days, it looks like a furious demo. But on this sun-splashed weekday morning, democracy looks like this low-ceilinged meeting room in a converted church, slap bang in the middle of the road that runs from Manchester to Stockport.None of the “students” have ever picked up an economics textbook. At a guess, most would be either stumped or sedated by the Financial Times. Yet here they are, starting a crash course in something that to them is a mystery. The majority are retired, having worked their entire lives. But when asked how many of them feel some control over the economy, not one raises a hand. So who is in charge?“Journalists – who are paid by rich people.”Amid all the humour pokes a truth. For this group, economics is something that’s done to them, by people sitting far away in Westminster or the City. They bear the brunt of spending cuts they struggle with the rottenness of Northern Rail and they see neighbours sinking into debt – and they have no decent account as to why. They have been bashed over the head again and\u0026nbspagain, and not even been shown the offending\u0026nbspshovel.Over in the corner sits Sue O’Connor, who today comes “sponsored by Visa!” Another gentle joke that masks the debtor’s panic of having her disability benefit hacked back. Cancer meant she lost all her income and wound up in sheltered housing. Now 64, she suffers severe arthritis, yet her Motability car is about to be taken away.While at a secondary modern, her class was judged too thick to learn any maths. Partly because the teenager wasn’t taught to count, the grey-haired woman still feels she doesn’t count. “Information is power,” she tells the group. “If I can learn in this class, maybe others will listen to me.”More confident is 70-year-old “raging feminist” Lechner. “The economy is a system, right?” she says. “I understand systems like patriarchy and how it’s set so certain people get hurt … and I want to know how the rules of the economy are set.”Headlam nods: “Somehow, someone, somewhere made these rules up. They aren’t laws of nature.” And they determine “who’s got what and where and why”.That tearing sound you can hear is the veil that normally partitions economics from society and politics.Up till 2008, someone like O’Connor would have been told over and over that if she’d failed to get ahead it was her fault, not the system’s. She’d just not followed the rules. Then came the financial crisis, which turned into a crisis of economics.When the Queen famously asked why no economist saw the crash coming, she cut to the heart of the matter: perhaps those who wrote the economy’s laws and policed their observance weren’t so qualified after all. And while some practitioners claim that theirs is a semi-science, all prescriptions to revive the economy – from George Osborne’s historic austerity to the hundreds of billions doled out to asset-owners by the Bank of England – underline how it’s fundamentally political. By the time Michael Gove remarked in the Brexit campaign that “people in this country have had enough of experts”, he was picking a squelchy-soft target.One of the biggest battles over economics kicked off just up the road from this community centre. At the University of Manchester in 2013, economics undergraduates – tired of memorising abstract models while the eurozone burned – linked up with students from around the world to demand their economics curriculum be changed. Nothing beyond the orthodoxy of free-market economics was being taught no conflicting global developments, nothing of its critics such as Keynes or Marx, despite their contemporary relevance. Thus began an epic, and epically imbalanced, fight of a bunch of teenagers taking on the very professors marking their exam papers.Student passions usually fizzle out faster than you can say “snakebite and black”, yet a half decade on, the struggle to prise open economics has got broader. Those ardent undergraduates propping up the union bar are now civil servants pushing for change in government economics or they’re directing charities such as Economy, which is putting on this crash course in Levenshulme. The aim is to nail the format, then do 15 courses next year, partnering with housing associations, local authorities and others across the UK.As you might expect from the first session of the first course, this morning’s proceedings betray some nerves. In an ordinary jacket and denim skirt, Headlam tells the class: “We had no idea if you would come.” Unlike the brogue-wearing professoriat, she and her co-facilitator Anne Hines give no sense that they come from a distant planet. Tomorrow morning, former pharmacist Hines sits her own economics exam for an Open University degree course while Headlam, even with her doctorate, describes her academic career as making “target practice for the elite institutions”.The pair are giving their time for free, and attendees don’t pay a penny. Economy’s Clare Birkett put together the course and organised the pilots on a part-time wage. All five courses, each lasting up to two months and educating anywhere between 50 and 80 people, will together cost little more than the tuition fees for one solitary economics degree.A few academic economists will ask what authority a bunch of amateurs have, but Birkett has prepared her fighting talk: “If they say, ‘How dare you talk about this?’, I’ll say, ‘Why shouldn’t I? I’ve put in the work, I’ve studied these things. This stuff belongs to all of us.’”Short of paying nine grand a year for a degree, how else are lay people meant to find out about the most potent social science of all? The internet is full of blind alleys, while even public lectures within universities typically assume some prior knowledge. Given how some economists rage that they’re not listened to enough on issues such as Brexit, it’s notable how little\u0026nbspthey actually engage with the public (one excellent exception is the annual Bristol Festival of Economics).Not so long ago, a Levenshulme resident could learn economics – or any number of other subjects – through the adult evening classes offered by the University of Manchester. The extramural programme stretched as far afield as Wigan and Burnley, and by the 1970s employed more than 30 academic staff. Then followed decades of cuts, until the entire department was shut down in 2006.To make the economy more democratic, as everyone from Theresa May to Jeremy Corbyn proposes, we need to democratise knowledge of economics. That’s a truth now cottoned on to by organisations as disparate as the Bank of England and Momentum.Everyone here brings their own lived experience of economics. In her motorised wheelchair, Joanne Wilcock notes how “everything is much more expensive when you’re disabled”. Bang on, yet you hardly ever read that in an article on the latest inflation figures. Bhatt knows that Levenshulme is supposed to be gentrifying – “fancy cars, flash weddings” – but notices his neighbours can’t afford to do up their own houses. “All fur coat and no knickers!” he concludes, and the room cracks up.And if you’re expecting them to trot out the usual left-itudes about fixing the economy, you’re wrong. A discussion about Northern Rail does produce calls for nationalisation – but also arguments as to how it should be turned into a co-op, or run by an arms-length organisation of technocrats.Has you or your community come up with answers to doing things differently?

We’ll include some of your stories in our reporting.Lechner starts on about “citizen scientists” – amateurs who conduct their own experiments – and casts an eye around the room. “Why can’t we be citizen economists?”That may be the most radical suggestion of the day, because it cuts directly against how both right and left usually do their business. In 1894, the year before cofounding the London School of Economics, Fabian Beatrice Webb confided to her diary: “We have little faith in the ‘average sensual man’. We do not believe that he can do more than describe his grievances, we do not think he can prescribe his remedies … we wish to introduce into politics the professional expert.”That impulse may now be dressed up in polite euphemism – but it lives on. “So many thinktanks and MPs come up with good ideas to change our economy, but they’re all stuck in their political bubble,” says the head of Economy, Joe Earle. “Ordinary people barely get a say in the thing that rules their lives.”Contrast that with this class and its polite horizontalism, where no one is presumed to be a total expert and everyone is treated as if they have something valuable to say. It is the seeds of that ferment described by Hilary Wainwright in her recent book, A New Politics from the Left.Drawing on her experience of feminist and workers’ self-organisation, she writes: “Rebel movements shared and developed their own kinds of knowledge, via practice and through debate and deliberation, and on to producing new ideas and the basis of new institutions. Authority, once it has been confidently questioned by those on whose obedience it depends, crumbles in ways that make it difficult to put back together again.”At the end of the class, each participant tells the rest the best thing they have learned. There’s a pause when it gets to Aklima Akhter, who only came to this country in 2013 and has been sitting so benignly quiet in her white headscarf. She starts haltingly: “It is difficult for me, you know … the subject, the language.”All around her are faces pursed in little moues of encouragement, but then Akhter speeds up with\u0026nbspfluency. “But my favourite word was ‘nationalisation’. Because when things are privatised it is the rich who get all the benefit.” And for once in this room, no one is laughing.• Aditya Chakrabortty is senior economics commentator for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7e8aefa7c7e567f556c47483e23e5bad9cc938b/94_52_3425_2055/master/3425.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20b4fdad40b2fb17513c24f36f5ac496","title":"why is love island so popular","story":"Every day millions of people ask Google life’s most difficult questions. Our writers answer some of the commonest queriesPrior to this season of Love Island starting, a very happily married couple I know were discussing whether they would succumb. He’d seen it before, she hadn’t. “You see, it’s kind of like chess,” he explained to her. “Chess?!” she scoffed. “You mean chess with tits!”As formulas go, it has a winning precedent – Big Brother. Some 5 million viewers tuned in during its heyday to see just how Stanford prison experiment it could get, especially once the producers started pitting the contestants against one another in tasks. Given that Love Island actively requires its chosen few to enter into a form of romantic game theory – selecting someone who is hopefully equally enamoured of them and sticking with them, no matter what – however superficial it may seem on the surface (a rotation of biceps, bikinis and bafflement over Brexit), the constant surveillance, enforced “recoupling” and creeping doubts over loyalties, formed at destabilising speed, make it more than a narcissistic pageant for a new crew of reality stars – this is a lesson in how humans meet, mate, hate and doubt themselves and one another again and again. What’s not to love?As children we learn most of everything we understand about love from our caretakers. Observing them, being nurtured by them, or being abandoned by them condition how we form romantic bonds as adults. As we mature, we often gain perspective on our parents’ mistakes, and empathy towards them. But that doesn’t usually offset the attachment style we’ve already developed as a result – broadly categorised today as secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, or fearful-avoidant.Even without an understanding of the terminology, most of us still have an instinctive understanding of the pushpull power games that often characterise an anxiously attached inidual in thrall to an avoidantly attached one, and watching those play out can be unwittingly emotionally “arousing” for us, the viewer. While it’s difficult to accurately label anyone’s attachment style without delving into their past relationship history and upbringing, when we watch Adam maintain his roving eye and silver tongue with all the girls at the villa, despite coupling up with Rosie who had developed breakneck speed feelings for him, it is she who ends up sobbing to the other girls, “Why aren’t I enough?” Even after she confronts him publicly once about his snaky behaviour, a few days later and they’re “cosier” in bed than ever before – and then he’s on the prowl yet again. Who you side with – and how much – may tell you something about your own attachment style.From an audience perspective, start to empathise, however briefly, and you’ll start to invest in the outcome – and keep watching. Add to this the chatter from Twitter, and water-cooler gossip with friends and family about why and who deserves to win, and we begin to see why this show inflames us – how to love is so rarely cross-examined that to hear someone we know and care for profess an entirely opposing view on it enthralls and infuriates us in equal measure. At this point, we may even continue to watch – and keep debating it – to keep the mutual personal excavation going.But is Love Island simply so popular because we enjoy looking at attractive young people getting it on – and messing it up? Only partly. Love Island would not work as well with older contestants. But that’s not only because of the pulchritudeschadenfreude equation. With experience, we can grow better able to assess the authenticity and motivations of those we meet – or we can end up even more prejudiced, as we carry forth a wound from one bad relationship or business deal and allow it to colour every other encounter thereafter. You can be 80 and able to spot a sociopath at 50 paces, or still be rooting for the wrong one. The difference is, at 23, there’s still plenty of time for you to learn from your mistakes – and it’s that hope that keeps them – and us – invested.And there’s the rub. Love Island, in essence, is not about love but about loyalty – not only between the couples but the fake or not friendships that guide the participants in their most vulnerable moments. When we watch Love Island, we’re on Couch Olympus. Can we figure out someone’s game plan, their unconscious motivations and how they will act before they do? If yes, we feel satisfied. If not, well, it’s only trash TV.• Nichi Hodgson is the author of The Curious History of Dating: From Jane Austen to Tinder and a sex and relationships broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b973c9b26afc40a7bbaa8c4d4112809a9ddb54ee/0_149_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb82ae158b23a8d586ec1ca5406de9ac","title":"barnacled angels the whales of stellwagen bank a photo essay","story":"Off the tip of Cape Cod, pods of humpbacks return every summer to feed. For the past 18 years,  Philip Hoare has been joining them to witness this incredible displayOff the tip of Cape Cod, pods of humpbacks return every summer to feed. For the past 18 years,  Philip Hoare has been joining them to witness this incredible displayAt the tip of Cape Cod, a sandy spit reaches out into the Atlantic, like an arm, towards a vast underwater plateau where humpbacks gather each summer to feed. This is the US marine sanctuary of Stellwagen Bank, where for the past three weeks I’ve been a guest on the Dolphin Fleet whalewatch boats, working out of Provincetown. I’ve been coming here for 18 years it’s where I learned about whales. I’m inordinately fond of these animals and like me, they come back here too. Every spring, the whales return from their mating grounds in the Caribbean where they’ve spent the winter, fasting: those clear blue waters hold no sustenance for a whale. The grey-green seas of the Cape are filled with food: the cycle of upwelling nutrition feeds phytoplankton, that feed zooplankton, that feed the sand-eels, that feed the whales. They’re unconcerned by the clouds of gulls that follow them, in the same cycle, after the same food – even stealing fish out of the whales’ mouths. Like other rorqual whales, humpbacks’ throats expand in rubbery pleats reaching down to their navels. Opening their mouths wide, they strain their food using the strips of baleen – made of keratin, the same substance found in human fingernails – that hang from their upper jaws. Humpbacks co-operate in one of the most spectacular sights in the natural world. Blowing precisely calibrated streams of bubbles from their mouths, they swim round in circles, creating curtains of air around their prey. Then they rise, open-mouthed like giant crows. As they do so, they seem to alter the shape of the water itself. This whale is thwacking its tail up and down in behaviour known as lob-tailing. But only the humpbacks of Stellwagen Bank use another technique, ‘kick-feeding’, to stun their prey. It’s learned, local culture.This may be the most closely studied population of great whales in the world. The Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies (PCCS) was founded in 1976 to observe and document these animals. At that time, whaling was still widely practised. A veteran captain of the Dolphin Fleet told me that back in the 1960s, one Provincetown diner used to serve humpback steaks. With the advent of the Dolphin Fleet whalewatch, founded in 1975 by the Avellar family (Portuguese in descent, like many of the fishing community in Provincetown), commerce was allied with science. With naturalists on the boats, PCCS was able to gather an immense database, sustained by tourist dollars. The result is a catalogue of 2,000 inidual whales. One of the first to be named, Salt, has had 14 calves, and is now a great-grandmother.  Humpbacks have unique black and white patterns on the underside of their flukes, enabling the identification of inidual animals. Each receives non-gender-specific names not because Provincetown is a gender-fluid town – which it certainly is – but because it is difficult to sex a whale.This whale is an exception. She’s displaying her genital mound, which is usually impossible to see.Some whales are truly striking. This speckled female has been called Ventisca –Spanish for “snowstorm”. She’s one of the first whales I ever saw, back in 2000. She’s a popular performer, partial to rolling on her back. Humpbacks show no fear of the whalewatch boats. These whales may also be among the most habituated to humans. Sometimes on the boat we joke that we’re providing a ‘human watch’ for whales. As to what they really make of us, we may never know. Dennis Minsky, veteran naturalist on the Dolphin Fleet, has a wild theory. “Every day I announce a whale’s name over the tannoy system,” he says. “If my dog Dory recognises her name, what’s to say these whales don’t?” This whale rose perpendicularly through the water to peer at us. It’s called “spy-hopping” to me it looks like curiosity. Fascinated by whale-human culture, Minksy has compiled a “whalewatch glossary” of terms used by the captains. A breaching whale is a “Hail Mary”. Irritating leisure craft are generically “plastic”. It’s a sort of update on Moby-Dick. With more swear words.Fin whales – the next biggest animals on Earth after blue whales – also scythe through these waters. Vast and enigmatic, nicknamed the greyhounds of the sea, they can reach 24 knots, as fast as our boat. They have uniquely asymmetrical markings – pale on one side of their bodies, dark on the other. They use the white side to scare fish with a sudden flash – then gulp down their prey. A pair of lunge-feeding fin whales once lurched so close to our prow that our captain, Todd Motta, shouted, “Whoa!”, But far from colliding with us, they seemed to be using our boat as a fish-stop. On calm days, this ocean becomes hypnotic. Below its silvery surface - which Herman Melville called “the ocean’s skin” - white-sided dolphin surfed into view, leaping and foraging around the whales. They’re beautifully marked, with grey and mustard stripes that seem to streamline their bodies. One came close to the boat, visible through that watery skin like a super-realist art work by Gerhard Richter.  Of all great whales, humpbacks are most prone to breaching. No one knows why. Are they trying to dislodge troublesome parasites or communicating with other whales? Anyone who sees a 15-metre whale launch itself out of the ocean is sure of one thing: it looks like fun. Melville observed of the humpback: “He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.” As this calf leapt, it looked close to landing on a dolphin. Hanging there in the air, a humpback demonstrates its kinship with us. No whale so well deserves its binomial: Megaptera novaeangliae – “big-winged New Englander”, a barnacled angel.• With grateful thanks to the Dolphin Fleet, its crew and its naturalists.Philip Hoare’s RisingTideFallingStar (4th Estate) is published this month in paperback.

The Commons environment, food and rural affairs, environmental audit, health and social care, and transport committees had made a series of recommendations to the government in the joint report in March. They included bringing forward a planned ban on the sale of new conventional diesel and petrol cars from 2040.In its response, published on Wednesday, the government maintained that the existing date would put the UK at the forefront of the global transition to cleaner road transport. It said its overall strategy to cut air pollution would “help us achieve our goals of cleaner air, a better environment, zero-emission vehicles and a strong, clean economy”.MPs remain concerned about efforts to improve air quality. Mary Creagh, the chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “We need cities where people can move and can breathe, so it is worrying that the government is dragging its feet on air quality, even in the face of legal action by the European court of justice. “It is also concerning that the government is not ready to demonstrate global leadership by forcing manufacturers to produce only clean vehicles before 2040.” Lilian Greenwood, the chair of the transport select committee, said: “Our report called on the government to take action to reduce our reliance on cars and increase the use of public transport. We are disappointed, therefore, that the response does not include any substantial public transport or urban planning initiatives.”The government has previously been criticised for a lack of urgency in tackling the air pollution crisis. Several other countries including India, Norway, Ireland and the Netherlands have set much more ambitious targets for vehicle bans.The unprecedented joint inquiry was launched amid concerns over the government’s air quality plans, which have repeatedly been successfully challenged in the courts by environmental groups and found to be so inadequate as to be illegal.The UN’s special rapporteur on pollution said last year that the UK government was “flouting” its duty to protect the health of its citizens, while the problem was declared a public health emergency by a cross-party committee of MPs in 2016.Air pollution causes an estimated 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK and is linked to health problems from childhood illnesses to heart disease and dementia.Concerns over nitrogen dioxide emissions have grown since Volkswagen was found in September 2015 to have cheated air pollution tests with 11m diesel vehicles worldwide.

Macdonald has always been a supremely sympathetic performer, but her mousy air may have been seen as a big-screen limitation. She scuttled round in subservient roles (Gosford Park, Nanny McPhee), before escaping pantry duty via HBO’s Boardwalk Empire: a wife part, yes, but one that proved steelier than first imagined over that five-season run. TV arcs bend towards their own form of justice.Puzzle, the offbeat US indie opening this year’s Edinburgh film festival, finds Macdonald tending house yet again – though here it’s an acknowledgement of wasted potential, a corner from which her character Agnes needs to be sprung. We join her doing the day shift in her commuter-belt New York home, odd woman out in a conservative bolthole lorded over by mechanic husband Louie (David Denman) and two boisterous college-age sons. Escape comes, unexpectedly, in the form of a jigsaw puzzle – a birthday present that gives Agnes respite from chores. Yet the gift also opens this meek den-mother’s eyes to her great, long-honed facility for putting everything in its rightful place.The out-of-the-box story derives from The Puzzle, a 2009 Argentinian drama written and directed by Lucrecia Martel associate Natalia Smirnoff. What the new version’s director Marc Turtletaub and screenwriters Oren Moverman and Polly Mann presumably responded to was the gradual expansion of one woman’s horizons. (Agnes’s first jigsaw forms a map of the world.) Puzzling allows our heroine welcome downtime, but also draws her outside in pursuit of bigger challenges. Shuttling into Manhattan, she’s steered towards competitive puzzling by cosmopolitan émigré Robert (a nicely understated Irrfan Khan), a spiritual guru who reformulates into something more.What follows never entirely assumes those now-familiar, Sundance-approved indie contours. Yes, it’s a semi-quirky drama that repeatedly returns to the sight of fully grown iniduals using jigsaw puzzles as metaphors for the way we live our lives. (“It’s a way to control the chaos,” insists Robert.) Yet there’s even odder activity going on within these frames: they haven’t had the haphazardness of lived experience sanded off them to better fit a screenwriting template. Abundant religious symbolism sometimes gives Puzzle the look of a consoling matinee remake of Darren Aronofsky’s Pi, one in which the protagonist finds, rather than loses, herself in patterns and shapes.The cast lend this quest emotional weight and complexity. There are moments that Macdonald nails out of decades-long habit: Agnes’s quiet pride at completing a 1,000-piecer, say, or her painful modesty upon meeting Robert’s gaze. What’s new is that she also gets to assert herself: Agnes will eventually hit Louie with a pricelessly sarcastic: “I’ll get your dinner now, dear.” Her pairing with the eternally lived-in Khan is itself an assertion of sorts – no one would have thought of putting these two together – and one complicated by Denman’s bluffly sympathetic hubby, though it’s perhaps inevitable the latter should start sweeping completed puzzles on to dining-room floors. Puzzle remains as unfashionably analogue a ersion as jigsaws themselves might be in the computer game era – touchingly committed to watching flawed, lopsided humanoids attempting to tesselate – and it sometimes seems a little neat about recording this process. A wilder project might have gone all-in on the competitive puzzling, where Turtletaub skirts the scene’s fringes, more compelled by character than sensation. Yet there is modest craft and genuine heart here, not to mention an eye-catching centrepiece: an actor growing more certain of herself, and more capable than ever of holding an entire picture together – even one as unusual, and sometimes as unlikely, as this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/578af4971d31e6c224f1c91d74128aac2f72fd5f/78_100_3209_1926/master/3209.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576d7bf1f7588cce61a0b2dc09829f30","title":"jack wilshere arsenal exit confirmed reduced playing time contract unai emery","story":"• Midfielder says meeting with new manager made up his mind• Wilshere wanted to stay at club he joined aged nineJack Wilshere has confirmed he is leaving Arsenal when his current contract at the club expires at the end of this month. The midfielder announced his decision on Tuesday evening after claiming his “playing time would be significantly reduced” under the club’s new manager, Unai Emery.Wilshere made 197 appearances for Arsenal, 38 of which came last season – his best total since 2013-14 – and said it was always his intention throughout the recent contractual discussions to remain an Arsenal player.“Such was my desire to stay that I had in fact recently agreed to sign a financially reduced contract in order to commit my future to the club, said Wilshere in a statement on social media. “However, following my meeting with the new manager I was made aware that, although the reduced contract offer remained, it was made clear to me that my playing time would be significantly reduced should I decide to stay.“I am sure everyone can understand that at this point in my life and career I need to be playing regular first team football and following my meeting with Mr Emery I came away feeling that it would be very difficult for me to do so at Arsenal. Given this, I feel I have no option but to pursue other opportunities in order to progress my career on the pitch.”Wilshere was left out of England’s World Cup squad by Gareth Southgate in May and failed to make the stand-by list. Everton, West Ham and Juventus have been linked in the past with signing the central midfielder but Wilshere declined to say where he sees his future next season.Wilshere became Arsenal’s youngest-ever player when he made his debut aged 16 and 256 days in a Premier League win over Blackburn Rovers in 2008 and spent 17 of his 26 years at the London club. He was named PFA Young Player of the Year in 2010-11 and also earned a place in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year that season.Wilshere singled out Arsène Wenger for special praise and thanked “everyone at the academy for helping me to fulfil my dream and of course the fans, who I have always shared such a special relationship with.”Arsenal also released a statement: “Everyone at Arsenal would like to wish Jack Wilshere a successful future following his decision to seek new opportunities. Since joining our Academy more than 17 years ago aged just nine Jack has been a tremendous player for the club and a much-loved member of the Arsenal family. Thank you Jack for your contribution and the fantastic memories. Good luck in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0f786100db17c5cabe33224496cee9acbb0302/394_16_2594_1556/master/2594.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bae11725a143cf24b815d333782e89dc","title":"ruben loftus cheek  start england panama world cup","story":"• Dele Alli unlikely to be fit for second World Cup game• Midfielder suffered thigh strain in first half against TunisiaRuben Loftus-Cheek is in line to make his first World Cup start, against Panama on Sunday, with Dele Alli rendered a major doubt for England’s second group game after suffering a minor thigh strain in Monday’s victory over Tunisia.Alli, who had pulled up just before half-time in clear discomfort, for all that he surprisingly played on after the break, underwent a scan at a private hospital in St Petersburg on Tuesday that revealed minor damage to his quad muscle. The England medical staff will continue to monitor him over the rest of the week at their base in Repino where he will be treated on site, but the 22-year-old is expected to miss at least two days’ training in the build-up to the match in Nizhny Novgorod.It seems unlikely that Alli, who had started the game so well at the Volgograd Arena and limped away from the stadium unaided, will now be risked against Panama, who are perceived to be the weakest team in Group G and were beaten 3-0 by Belgium in the first match. That should give Loftus-Cheek, who impressed on loan from Chelsea at Crystal Palace last season, his opportunity to follow up his 10-minute cameo against Tunisia.He had replaced Alli and offered strength and direct pace down the right, an unfamiliar position after he spent most of last season playing on the left, and won the corner from which Harry Kane scored his stoppage-time winner. The 22-year-old made his international debut in November, impressing against the world champions, Germany, and a three-month spell out injured mid-season had threatened his inclusion in the squad.Gareth Southgate has long admired Loftus-Cheek and, after an eye-catching last six games of the season for Palace, he was included in the 23-man party and impressed in the pre-tournament friendly against Costa Rica in Leeds.Southgate’s instinct had been to stick with the lineup that started so well against Tunisia, though Alli’s absence would force at least one change and could resolve his dilemma over whether to retain Raheem Sterling. His pace and movement had troubled Tunisia early on, but Sterling appeared anxious in front of goal with his display rather fading during the grind of the second half.His substitution for Rashford with 22 minutes remaining means the 23-year-old has now gone 21 caps without a goal, stretching back to October 2015, with Rashford offering a more direct threat alongside Harry Kane. His direct running and link-up play unsettled a tiring Tunisian back-line, with the player’s impact serving to force opponents further into retreat.The Manchester United striker has proved his form and fitness despite twice missing training in Repino last week after suffering a knock to his knee in the squad’s last session at St George’s Park before their departure for Russia, but Southgate may be reluctant to incorporate two new attacking players from the start against Panama in a game which, if won, could secure England’s passage into the next phase.Southgate has been hugely supportive of Sterling since assuming the reins of the national team, standing by the forward as he found himself caught in a media storm over a tattoo of an M-16 assault rifle on his right calf and praising his energetic display against Tunisia.The manager’s other issue had been at left wing-back, where Ashley Young performed well in Volgograd, not least with his delivery in the build-up to the first goal. Danny Rose would normally be Southgate’s first-choice in that role but he is short of match fitness after a season heavily disrupted by injuries at Tottenham. He had trained well in the build-up to the first game and will be in full contention for the fixtures to come.Fifa is to investigate whether there was a failure of video technology in the game against Tunisia after Kane appeared to be denied two penalties either side of half-time. The Colombian referee, Wilmar Roldán, took no action and the four VAR officials also failed to intervene, leaving England perplexed. Brazil have formally complained to Fifa after claiming they were denied two key decisions in their draw with Switzerland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bdc44a4e9a2f2063850415a325b50bed52bab35/0_262_4296_2578/master/4296.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf929b09680607cba2a2adc6753747cc","title":"russia egypt world cup match report","story":"The emotional spectrum of football was exposed in all its shuddering extremes an hour into this piece of sporting theatre. Russia’s hulking forward Artem Dzyuba spun off into the night, tapping his head, veins pumping, screaming, in recognition of one of the most momentous goals of his career. A masterful finish had put Russia 3-0 up and the emphatic nature of the scoreline all but confirmed qualification and sent Egypt home.As Dzyuba relished his moment Mohamed Salah stood, numbed, in the centre circle, this weird adventure crushed, hands on hips, staring into the middle distance. After all the dedicated hours of rehabilitation and all the hopes, a million roubles for his thoughts.Egypt’s icon hauled himself out of his melancholic trance and offered a half-hearted clap to try to rally his teammates but in reality he knew. Everybody knew. This was Russia’s party. Even with Salah back in the team, Egypt were unable to stage the ultimate gatecrash.Salah had been late to this fiesta and working his way into a match of this tempo was challenging. He had a moment where he was able to make his mark of sorts with a consolation goal from the penalty spot, plus a series of nearly chances either side of that, but he could do no more. Russia’s elation was merited. For all those who scoffed it was only Saudi Arabia when they opened the tournament with a 5-0 win, they produced another high‑energy display full of confident verve. So far this World Cup could not be going any better for the home country.This might have been Russia’s night but Egypt brought a unique sense of occasion. Their fans were massed all over the ground, bringing an electric surge of excitement from the moment they saw Salah’s face adorn the big screens. The sense of hero worship created an expectancy that was almost unfathomable for a player whose fitness had been so instrumental to this World Cup experience for his country.After three and a half weeks nursing an injured shoulder Salah returned into a game played with frantic intensity. Russia were buoyant. The feelgood factor bristled around the stadium. Their coach, Stanislav Cherchesov, had claimed he had plans to nullify Salah, and evidently the plan was to dominate, to attack in numbers, to demand possession, to shoot on sight and to ping high balls into the box whenever possible. The ball was pushed forward with a thrilling urgency that cranked up the pressure.Egypt settled and began to weave together some moves. Salah had a couple of glimmers, aided by Marwan Mohsen’s determination as his attacking foil. Both managers gesticulated furiously, pounding around their technical areas, immersed in the desperation. At a moment of brief respite after a shot sailed over the bar the goalkeeper, Ahmed El-Shenawy, gestured to everybody to just calm down. Even for a second. Try to breathe.Egypt’s hopes were hit by a body blow just after half-time. Russia’s goal came suddenly and awkwardly. Instigated by Aleksandr Golovin, whose cross was punched weakly by El-Shenawy, Roman Zobnin struck the rebound into the ground and the trajectory was going wide. But Ahmed Fathi, Egypt’s captain, was worried about the presence of Dzyuba over his shoulder, flung himself anxiously in front of the Russian striker, and his clearance was clumsy – devastatingly so. The ball veered into the corner of the net.Three decisive minutes around the hour transformed the game. Russia were elevated, Egypt flattened. Both goals were carved out with slick precision. First Cheryshev coolly dispatched Mário Fernandes’s clever reverse pass. Then Dzyuba gave an exhibition of classic centre‑forward power play, chesting the ball on before curling his shot past El-Shenawy.Salah could not quite shake his inner belief when Egypt were awarded a penalty with the assistance of VAR, which advised the referee a foul took place inside the area. He kissed the ball, put it down and slammed it in after an arcing run-up. And that – after all the attention, the national fervour, the work to try to help his nation here in Russia – was that.Héctor Cúper lamented that Salah had not been in a position to be more influential in the past few weeks. “We all know what Mo Salah means for national team,” he said. “He is a crucial vital player, a point of reference. He suffered an injury. We have all been very worried about it. It happened, that’s it.The home team celebrated effusively, the song Kalinka reverberating in their ears, with more to look forward to in the days ahead. Cherchesov was asked to consider whether this was the best day of his life. “I hope,” the coach answered, “there are many more to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60b8c9d903bb19816ef9584730b923c2099138df/0_389_5301_3180/master/5301.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb490fc281a507ea6139df1a6f610b05","title":"ten things weve learned from the first round of world cup games","story":"With every team having played at least one match,  writers in Russia offer their first impressionsThe political tensions and all the other issues with the Russian government will still be there when the World Cup leaves town, but it’s likely that a lot of people will depart Russia with great memories and a changed view of the country. Russia is putting on its best, most smiling face for the month: people are excited to welcome the tournament and the fans, and so far at least that is leading to overwhelmingly positive vibes. The cheap beer and warm sunshine in most host cities is not hindering this process, either. With Russian transport corridors all running through the capital, Moscow has become a hub for fans, with tens of thousands shuttling through for a couple of nights between games and creating a carnival atmosphere. Shaun Walker“We are the victims of Fifa and the ever-developing football,” the Egypt goalkeeper Essam El Hadary lamented on Monday. His manager, Héctor Cúper, appeared to find the comment amusing and it is, after all, a well-established rite of passage that shot-stoppers line up to take a pop at the ball. Igor Akinfeev is another to have had his say about the Telstar 18, but it is hard to see what they are complaining about because this summer’s edition seems the most reliable for some time. If the litmus test for a ball’s performance is the way it behaves on long-range shots and deliveries into the box then it has passed. Free-kicks from Aleksandr Golovin, Cristiano Ronaldo and Aleksandar Kolarov have left keepers helpless because the players were able to trust their technique rather than worry about the flight. A high number of goals from crossed set-pieces speaks partly of organisational issues but also comes down to the fact that this ball can reliably be placed on a sixpence. “The football might be more acceptable to the players than the goalkeepers,” El Hadary conceded, and perhaps that is the best indicator that all is, in fact, as it should be. Nick AmesVideo Assistant Refereeing is proving more isive than decisive with nations asking Fifa for clarification on why VAR wasn’t used in certain situations. England were bemused as to why VAR wasn’t invoked when Harry Kane twice appeared to be rugby tackled in the box. There is clearly some ironing out to be done but in one department it is seemingly exerting a positive influence. It took until the 15th game of the tournament for the first red card to be issued, for Colombia’s Carlos Sánchez. That is the cleanest start to a World Cup since 1986. Martha KelnerIf only football was as easy as throwing together the best pieces and expecting them to fit into an instant jigsaw. France came to Russia with a familiar set of expectations – excitement about the talent pool tempered by doubts about how efficiently they would be used. Didier Deschamps was bold in moulding his team around the selection of three attackers who are all blessed with pace and trickery. In theory, who would want to play against Kylian Mbappé, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembélé? But in practice it didn’t quite work out. The chemistry was not immediate. The front players were often difficult to find, with a big space between them and the midfield. France did not attack with verve in their opening game against Australia and there is still work to do if this team is to find the right balance and bring out the best in itself. Amy LawrenceWithout wishing to tempt fate, it is starting to feel like the tournament will pass without all the obvious concerns - racism and the kind of violence that was seen in Euro 2016 - embarrassing Russia and scarring the competition. The only issue in the England camp so far are the swarms of bugs. And the biggest danger in Repino seems to be the wild dogs that roam in the woodlands. One member of the media entourage, cycling inland from England’s base, encountered a pack of them and was pursued for two miles before reaching safety. Daniel TaylorGareth Southgate spoke about seeking to change the perception of English football on the eve of his side’s opening group game against Tunisia and, while it will take far more than a stoppage time win over the team ranked 21st in the world to achieve that lofty ambition, everything to date suggests he can succeed in that task. England so often lower the mood at major finals, either through stodgy football or general underachievement, but this group seem different. They have been a breath of fresh air to date, a team well aware of their shortcomings but completely convinced of their qualities. No team has created as many chances as they did in that first half in Volgograd, and the English had never previously scored a stoppage time winner in normal time at the World Cup. The vim and verve stems from the manager and the philosophy he has imposed. They feel like a side who can thrive in Russia. Dominic FifieldIt was only one lapse, and Tite, his players and the rest of Brazil’s 200 million-plus population continue to insist that Switzerland’s equaliser in Rostov on Sunday ought to have been disallowed for a push. But something shocking happened after the goal went in. Brazil went to pieces. All of a sudden, their control was gone for a period of about 15 minutes. It seemed to chime with how Brazil lives its football – via wild extremes of emotion. Tite would talk about anxiety, huge pressure and opening-night nerves and it was easy to recall how the Selecao have been tracked by tears and trauma at previous World Cups, not least the last one. Brazil stabilised and they threw everything at Switzerland during a chaotic finale only for the winner to elude them. Tite’s squad have the talent. The biggest battle they face could be with their internal equilibrium. David HytnerAs a gaggle of Russian, Serbian and Costa Rican fans walked down Molodogvardeyskaya Ulitsa, in the centre of Samara, someone produced a football. It was past midnight and everybody was making their way home after a long day that started in the stadium and finished with a viewing of Brazil v Switzerland in the FanZone. Any tiredness was forgotten as an impromptu match broke out in the street, its participants bridging language issues with a pass here and a trick there. Russia and Serbia do, in fairness, have a long-established relationship but the scene was typical of the friendships that have been formed in the more provincial cities. The appetite for cultural exchange has been heartfelt: Samara, to take one example, was a closed city until 1991 and there has been visible emotion at the sight of football’s biggest show, and its accompanying melange of international visitors, rolling into town. It is genuinely heartwarming to see this opportunity being grasped so firmly. Nick AmesA World Cup in Brazil was always going to be well-attended by the other South American countries for obvious reasons, but it has been truly remarkable to see supporters from that part of the World travelling to Russia in such huge numbers and, in the case of Saransk, pretty much taking over the city and the stadium. Peru, who are the eighth-best supported country at the World Cup according to the number of official tickets sold in each nation, made the Mordovia Arena feel like a home venue against Denmark on Saturday. And Colombia, who sold 65,234 official tickets for these finals, which is more than twice as many as England, did something similar at the same stadium for their match against Japan on Tuesday. Listening to the stories that fans tell, explaining the sacrifices they have made, it shines through that watching their national team play means a lot more to them than people in many other countries, in particular in Europe and including England.

Can they avoid being added to the nominations for the worst World Cup teams?After Zaire had been thumped by Yugoslavia 9-0, the words of Mobutu Sese Seko, the country’s president and brutal dictator, rang in the ears of the defender Mwepu Ilunga as Brazil’s Rivellino and Jairzinho chewed over a free-kick 20 yards from goal in their final group game. Mobutu’s message had been clear: if the squad intended to return home, losing to Brazil by more than three goals was non-negotiable. At 2-0 down in Gelsenkirchen, Ilunga wrote his name into World Cup folklore with some spectacular time‑wasting, as he put it, darting out of a five-man defensive wall to hoof the ball into the opposition half. He was booked. The game finished 3-0 and the first sub-Saharan team to qualify for a World Cup were never going to be forgotten in a hurry. They had opened by losing 2-0 to Scotland. Mobutu branded the performances as embarrassing and dropped the team’s funding but Zaire did at least return home safely.A 10-1 pummelling by Hungary in their opener (the most goals conceded in a World Cup match) set the tone. The war-torn country arrived as heroes in Spain but were shunned on their return the 36-year-old manager Mauricio Rodríguez was blacklisted and never coached again. Qualifying for the World Cup was a miracle but their preparation was badly hampered they landed three days before that humbling in Elche – in which the substitute Laszlo Kiss scored a seven-minute hat-trick – without their full squad, two popular players jettisoned in favour of officials at the last moment. For those who did make it, there were not enough tracksuits or balls. Politics ruled. “The country was in deep suffering and we had the pressure of trying to reduce it,” the midfielder Mauricio Alfaro said. Before their second game they sought to restore some confidence by rising to the challenge offered by the waiters at the team’s hotel. They duly stuffed them before masterclasses in damage limitation against Belgium (1-0) and Argentina (2-0). Nevertheless, they returned home humiliated.It was impossible for Nasser al-Johar’s side to recover from being demolished 8-0 by Germany in Sapporo. It was a defeat compounded by Oliver Bierhoff’s toe-poked daisy-cutter from distance, by which point Miroslav Klose had a hat-trick. That performance will live as one of international football’s worst. It was not supposed to matter anyway, for Johar had been assured his job was safe regardless of events. But raw and painful defeats to Cameroon (1-0) and Mick McCarthy’s Republic of Ireland (3-0) put paid to such promises. Saudi Arabia were the first team sent packing and departed without scoring.China have since pumped billions into football with the aim of establishing the country as a superpower, a hotbed of tomorrow’s talent. Yet their first World Cup – held in South Korea and Japan – proved an ordeal, pitted as they were against the eventual winners Brazil and semi-finalists Turkey, together with Costa Rica. They possessed a little knowhow in the shape of Li Tie and Sun Jihai, formerly of Everton and Manchester City respectively, but a 4-0 defeat by a Brazil team including Roberto Carlos, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo showed a gulf in class. It was a learning curve for their old-school manager too, with Bora Milutinovic failing to reach the knockout stage for the first time after success with Costa Rica, Mexico, Nigeria and the USA.France memorably imploded in South Africa eight years ago but only North Korea, ranked 105th at the time, were subjected to a six-hour dressing down and accused of “betraying” the nation, as well as their leader Kim Jong-il and his son and heir, prompting fears over the safety of the manager, Kim Jong-hun. Jong Tae-se and An Yong-hak got off lightly though, heading straight back to Japan where they played their club football. Fifa launched an investigation into Pyongyang’s alleged punishment. Things had looked reasonably promising after a 2-1 defeat by Brazil in their opening match – arguably the biggest mismatch in World Cup history. Maicon smashed home from an improbable angle and Elano doubled their lead before Ji Yun-nam cut the margin of defeat in the 89th minute, sparking wild celebrations. But, after that came a 7-0 humbling by Portugal, capped by Cristiano Ronaldo, before a 3-0 defeat by Ivory Coast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e03ac9d71fa674b28c096f551825af2a32e57220/0_357_4822_2894/master/4822.jpg?w=645\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfbc264d3824c93fb03be5d4da6195bd 645w","title":"uk foreign office ranks among worlds worst on revealing how aid is spent","story":"Annual index on transparency of major international donors rates Whitehall department as ‘poor’, though DfID scores highly The British Foreign Office has been ranked one of the world’s worst major aid donors on transparency, according to a new study.The Whitehall department was described as “poor” and “well below average” on transparency of aid spend, ranking 40th among 45 major donors by the Aid Transparency Index, launched by the global campaign Publish What You Fund. The annual index examines international donors that spend more than $1bn (£760m) in aid, and assess how easy it is to track the cash.The FCO ranks below South Korea’s International Co-operation Agency, which came 38th in the index. Spain’s agency for international development and the FCO were the only two European organisations included in the “poor” category.In contrast to the FCO’s low ranking, the Department for International Development (DfID) came third, with a rating of “very good”.Catherine Turner, director of advocacy at Publish What You Fund, said “This is a wake-up call to the Foreign Office to up their game when it comes to aid transparency. Such a low ranking raises questions about how seriously the FCO is taking their commitment to improve standards.”The 2015 UK aid strategy committed all government departments that provide aid to achieving a “good” or “very good” rating in the index by 2020.Katy Chakrabortty, Oxfam GB’s head of advocacy, said: “It’s a worrying irony that, amongst the departments other than DfID spending aid, the Foreign Office has taken the most strides towards transparency, yet remains almost rock bottom in the rankings … This is not good enough at a time when the government already spends over a quarter of UK aid outside of DfID.”The rising proportion of the £13.4bn British aid budget spent by departments outside of DfID has drawn concern from aid organisations, who see the FCO and others as less transparent.Recently, MPs from the international development committee told Penny Mordaunt, the development secretary, to “get a grip” on aid spent outside DfID, amid worries that millions of pounds were being spent in China. There have also been widespread transparency concerns over the conflict, stability and security fund, a cross-department aid pot set up under the auspices of the FCO and DfID.An FCO spokeswoman said it was committed to transparency but security issues prevented it releasing details on projects that were high-risk or in conflict zones.

Both are led by men, the former by 75-year-old Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power when his sacking by Mugabe in November led to a military takeover, and the latter by Nelson Chamisa, a 40-year-old lawyer and preacher.So far, any major increase in the representation of women in parliament looks unlikely. Only one in 10 Zanu-PF candidates and around one in seven opposition candidates are female. Women are also notably absent from the top ranks of both parties.Sibongile Sibanda, a 35-year-old businesswoman and the Zanu-PF youth secretary for external affairs, has been selected as a party candidate and is confident Zanu-PF will retain power, despite widespread dissatisfaction over its failure to markedly improve conditions in Zimbabwe since Mugabe’s fall.“I am really confident that we are going to win. People are really happy with the new dispensation,” she says.Just over a third of the 350 outgoing MPs and senators in Zimbabwe are women. But the majority of these were elected through a quota system created by the 2013 constitution, which will not be continued beyond 2023 without a new vote in parliament.Linda Masarira, a veteran activist and first-time MDC candidate in Harare, says political parties in Zimbabwe are “still suffering patriarchal dominance”.Many female politicians complain of a hostile and prejudiced environment in which abuse is common. Thokozani Khupe, a senior opposition leader, was called a “prostitute” by demonstrators during a leadership battle earlier this year, local media reported.The election is being closely scrutinised by the international community, which insists it must be “free, fair and credible” for Zimbabwe to receive the huge financial bailout needed to reboot the economy. Previous polls have been subject to systematic violence and rigging. But there has been no pressure for greater representation of women, nor support for female politicians.Many African countries already have parity legislation in place, with Uganda and Kenya leading the way in reserving seats in parliament for women and young people’s representatives.In April, Bineta Diop, the African Union’s special envoy for women, peace and security, called for further efforts to “make sure that women are part and parcel of the political decision-makers”. Diop told reporters in Addis Ababa: “We are not there yet. The glass is half full.”Stabile Milo, 36, a businesswoman from the Zimbabwean city of Bulawayo, is campaigning for the MDC and hopes to win a seat among the 60 guaranteed by the constitution.She is the MDC’s national secretary for gender parity and started her political career aged 18. “Young women are challenging the status quo that only older women could be effective politicians,” she says. “We can’t sit back and say men should just give us these posts. We have to fight and win it through our own hard work – and we will.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f376eabb24e96f01d528dc0d4e2d23cee19a438f/0_235_4255_2552/master/4255.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45842677a61d14556ff59e7fae4680bf","title":"clare smyth named best female chef in the world 50 best","story":"British chef who catered royal wedding is recognised by World’s 50 Best RestaurantsClare Smyth, a Northern Irish chef who catered for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s evening wedding reception, has been named the world’s best female chef.The culinary star, born in Antrim, was presented with the award at the World’s 50 Best Restaurants gala in Bilbao, Spain, on Monday, where she bemoaned the dearth of women at the pinnacle of her profession.“We still have a real lack of women recognised at the top of the industry,” Smyth, whose own restaurant was overlooked for the top 50, told attendees. “I would love to see very soon that we don’t need gender-specific awards because women will have recognition and there will be a balance in the industry. “Hopefully we’ll see plenty of women on the 50 Best list and there won’t be a need for that award,” she added.The Italian chef Massimo Bottura won best restaurant for his Modena-based Osteria Francescana. Smyth left her family’s farm between Ballymena and Belfast when she was 16 to study catering at Highbury College in Portsmouth. She then worked at Terence Conran’s Michelin House restaurant, the French Laundry in California and Per Se in New York, before becoming chef patron at Restaurant Gordon Ramsey in 2007.It was at Gordon Ramsay that she became the first and only female chef to run a British restaurant with three Michelin stars – just seven women in Michelin’s history have ever held its coveted three-star rating.In July 2017 she opened her Notting Hill restaurant, Core by Clare Smyth, which has since been awarded the title of best restaurant at the 2018 GQ Food and Drink Awards.Smyth catered for the royal wedding evening reception on 19 May for 200 people. Guests including George and Amal Clooney, Serena Williams, and Meghan’s best friend, Jessica Mulroney, and her husband, Ben, were served up “posh burgers” and pork belly with candy floss for dessert.Smyth is the first British woman to win 50 Best’s Elit Vodka world’s best female chef award.“I spent 15 years of my life in three-Michelin-starred restaurants and I trained to be the best I could be,” she said at the time. “It didn’t just happen, it wasn’t magic, I put in the work. “I stood shoulder to shoulder with men in the toughest kitchens in the world and excelled and loved it.”Smyth was awarded an MBE in 2013 for services to the hospitality industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0933e8d09ad2b83118bcf09a4a02613d4f50333e/0_0_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed67f71d0c4855b579aa6d6c119ab2be","title":"best albums of 2018 so far","story":"Lily Allen dished on her orce, Arctic Monkeys found their inner crooners, Cardi B earned her stripes, Pusha T teamed up with Kanye West and the Vaccines made an unexpected classicAs amusingly unfiltered as ever, Allen embraces the sunny disposition of Afro bashment and British rap, and pairs it with delicate, bruised and often dolorous songs about her orce – an affecting combination.What we said: “As Allen would doubtless point out, she never claimed to be perfect.

Tonight demands something different.”He then played a version of The Ghost of Tom Joad, a protest song he recorded in 1995, inspired by the character from John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath. Instead of Steinbeck’s dust bowl images of 1930s poverty, the Springsteen song draws on modern images of homelessness and inequality, including the lyric: “Wherever somebody’s fighting for a place to standOr a decent job or a helping handWherever somebody’s struggling to be freeLook in their eyes, Ma, and you’ll see me.”Adults have been swept up in a wave of prosecutions for entering the US illegally since April, while children have been held in makeshift cages inside temporary detention centres.Both Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, have suggested in the past 10 days that biblical teaching compels them to enforce the law. In recent years Springsteen has been regularly joined on stage by guitarist Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine to turn the acoustic song into a howling call to activism. Springsteen’s criticism came nine days after Robert de Niro introduced him at Broadway’s Tony Awards with an expletive-laden attack on Trump, which was bleeped out on US television.

According to researchers in Switzerland, the future of diabetes treatment will not be a shot in the arm after a meal, but a shot of espresso instead.The scientists hope to transform the lives of diabetics who need regular jabs with an implant that contains hundreds of thousands of designer cells which churn out medicine when they sense caffeine in the bloodstream.Tests on diabetic mice showed that such an implant inserted under the skin could be triggered by the caffeine in coffee, tea or energy drinks to produce a drug that controlled the animals’ blood sugar levels. To raise the dose, the scientists simply administered stronger coffee.“You could completely integrate this into your lifestyle,” said Martin Fussenegger, who led the team at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. “You have a tea or coffee in the morning, another after lunch, and another at dinner, depending on how much drug you need to get your glucose back down.”The implant will not be ready for humans any time soon. Fussenegger believes it could be a decade before the necessary tests and trials are done to demonstrate that the approach is safe and effective. But if it does work, it could replace the regular injections that many diabetics require. “You could have your normal life back. The implant could last for six months to a year before it would need to be replaced,” said Fussenegger.Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the Swiss researchers describe how they modified human cells to make a diabetes drug called GLP-1. The drug stimulates so-called beta cells in the pancreas to produce insulin which in turn controls blood sugar levels.The designer cells contain a “gene circuit” that enables them to sense caffeine molecules as they sweep by in the bloodstream. When the cells detect caffeine, they react by manufacturing GLP-1. The implant is made up of thousands of gel-like capsules that each contain hundreds of the designer cells. “When you inject them under the skin, they stick together like caviar,” said Fussenegger. The gel capsules shield the cells from the immune system, but allow caffeine in and GLP-1 out.To see how well the cells worked, the scientists exposed them to drinks with varying levels of caffeine, from chocolate milkshakes and herbal tea to cola, black tea, Red Bull, Starbucks coffee, and a range of instant coffee pods. Herbal tea and chocolate milkshakes had no effect on the cells, but all the other drinks triggered them to make GLP-1 in varying amounts depending on their caffeine content. More than 400m people worldwide are affected by type-2 diabetes and controlling blood sugar levels is a crucial part of managing the condition. A treatment that calls for shots of caffeine will not work for everyone, but Fussenegger is optimistic. “It could be quite an improvement in everyday life for these people. I don’t know many who drink neither tea nor coffee,” he said.

Grasses had perfect growing conditions over late April and in May with warm sunshine and showers. That was followed in June by hot dry conditions when the grass flowers matured and shed clouds of pollen on light breezes and up people’s noses.The strange thing is that hay fever was incredibly rare when it was first reported by John Bostoc, a London doctor, nearly 200 years ago. Yet in those days far more people lived and worked in the countryside, where grasses grew everywhere. Today, hay fever has reached epidemic proportions and afflicts more than a fifth of the British population, even in towns where you might imagine grass pollen is less of a problem.This statistic has been blamed on modern lifestyles, including factors such as obsessive hygiene and excessive use of antibiotics.Above all, air pollution from traffic is a huge factor in the upsurge of hay fever. Exhaust fumes help weaken pollen grains, making them split open more easily and spew out the allergic substances that trigger the condition. And polluting gases, such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide, also make hay fever sufferers more sensitive to pollen allergens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a97add85fad35428afb0efe913f236337be6ed/167_181_3147_1888/master/3147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3373308fb6cf55fb7693eed9f0093a09","title":"ascot beefed up security no incidents day one","story":"• No incidents of any significance, the track reports• Ascot to keep the measures in place for rest of festivalThere were “no incidents of any significance” on the first day of Royal Ascot, where heightened security measures were in place to prevent any repeat of the drunken violence that marred a meeting at the same course in May.The procedures included extensive use of sniffer dogs both at the racecourse entrance and throughout the enclosures to target racegoers in possession of illegal drugs.Extra security personnel were also on duty at the course and the track reserved the right to breath-test spectators on arrival if it was believed that they had already been drinking to excess.“There have been no incidents today of sufficient significance to be passed up the line,” Nick Smith, Ascot’s director of racing and communications, said. “Nobody was breath-tested as there was not felt to be any need, but the equipment will remain in place.”Ascot felt obliged to increase what were already the most significant security procedures at any British race meeting following two serious incidents of disorder at major Saturday race meetings this year.A brawl involving up to 50 iniduals at Goodwood racecourse in early May was followed by another incident at Ascot a week later when two groups of men were involved in fighting inside the grandstand at the end of the day’s racing. Smartphone footage of both incidents was widely circulated on social media.The attendance at the Berkshire track on Tuesday was 46,773, an increase of 2,488, or 5.6pc, on the total of 44,285 who were at the course on the same afternoon in 2017Willie Mullins is well known for breaking records over jumps at the Cheltenham Festival in March, but he left Ascot with a notable achievement on the Flat on Tuesday evening having saddled four of the first five runners home in the two-and-a-half mile Ascot Stakes Handicap.Lagostovegas, who overhauled Karen McLintock’s Dubawi Fifty inside the final furlong, was Mullins’s fourth winner in the race, and his stable companions Stratum, Chelkar and Whisky Sour finished third, fourth and fifth respectively.Mullins will now turn his attention to the Queen Alexandra Stakes on Saturday, a race he has won twice in the last six years.“I thought this mare might struggle to get the trip,” Mullins said of Lagostovegas. “It didn’t look a very strong gallop and that played into her hands.John Gosden, who along with jockey Frankie Dettori completed a treble on the opening day, are now odds-on to finish the week as the leading trainer and jockey respectively.

Tim Paine’s beleaguered tourists then crumbled to 239 all out for their heaviest one-day defeat by runs and England’s biggest.Morgan, who has led England from their harrowing World Cup campaign in 2015 to the dizzying heights of the No 1 side in the world, and now seen back-to-back series wins over Australia this year sewn up by their current 3-0 lead, is not a character prone to hyperbole but even he could not play down this remarkable performance.“It is the best, definitely,” said Morgan, having himself struck a 21-ball half-century from No\u0026nbsp5 to claim another English record. “What is most pleasing is the level of intensity we operated at throughout the whole game. Whoever came in, every bowler who came on, showed unbelievable energy, which is all you can ask.“The players are obviously proud of what they’ve achieved but certainly this is the best period of my career and the proudest as well.”Paine, who is leading a broken Australian side that is still reeling from the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa and lacking five first-team players through suspension or injury, was understandably at the opposite end of the emotional spectrum.He said: “I’ve been playing cricket since I was a kid, and that was the hardest day’s cricket of my life. You take your hat off, England struck the ball as well as I’ve ever seen. We just ran into some guys who are absolutely red hot at the moment and put us to the sword.”England’s dominance was perhaps summed up by Hales. While Bairstow made it four hundreds in six innings with his 139 from 92 balls, the 147 from 92 struck by the Nottinghamshire man at No 3 shows the assets at Morgan’s disposal, given he will likely make way when Ben Stokes is fit again.

As the nation’s best got down to business at Queen’s Club in west London this week, Lloyd added some heft to a 10-year strategy designed to keep the game afloat when Andy Murray eventually decides his hip is giving him too much gyp.“Tennis has been a constant in my life for as long as I can remember,” he said, a reference to his father, David, a stalwart of the game alongside his brother, John, and from whom Scott inherited much of his business nous.“It’s been inextricably bound up in family, friendships and, of course, my work.” So, with Murray entering his autumnal years, what next for British tennis?“It’s the second most followed sport in this country after football, with some 29 million fans, whether it’s those that just have a passing interest right the way through to the super fans for whom life just wouldn’t be complete without it.”But those numbers are, he admits, distorted by the nation’s obsession with Wimbledon, the 150th edition of which starts on 2 July, and he acknowledges the annual jamboree might struggle to sustain the interest of British fans beyond the first week.As he concedes: “The reality is that tennis faces a battle to stay relevant in a world of competing and almost limitless activities.”These are familiar sentiments. As children have become attached to computers and indoor games, more physical pursuits have been chasing a dwindling audience, from tennis to cricket and rugby. Lloyd says the LTA’s research shows competing activities have doubled in 10 years.“But, if I’m honest, a big part of the challenge, too, is that from the outside tennis is seen as inaccessible, elitist, expensive. Too many people in Britain think that tennis starts and ends with Wimbledon.”Or the local club he could have said – because it is there that the first brick wall goes up for any young enthusiasts thinking of giving tennis a go.“Even those who might want to get involved or might think about trying to play, finding somewhere to play, finding someone to play with, is just simply too difficult. Despite the LTA’s efforts over the years, this image of tennis persists and it’s an image that we need to try and change.”These are candid words. And he did not stop there. After canvassing opinion across the tennis landscape for six months before taking on the job, he said he realised, “that the tennis community is fractured”.There were “strong but very erse opinions” about how to kickstart the sport, he said. There was also “a real lack of understanding as to who is responsible for what in this sport”.Lloyd, like his predecessors, wants to make tennis “enjoyable, accessible, welcoming and relevant to everyone”. He wants to raise its profile from the bottom up, through the 10,000 LTA-approved competitions that exist beyond the ivy-clad walls of the All England Club.Where all this might get a bit political, as he was reminded, is in the government’s austerity crunch, which has crippled the spending power of local authorities, bodies who are more concerned, rightly, with collecting our rubbish than looking for the next Murray. “It’s challenging,” Lloyd says, “because they’re not our courts. They are the courts of the local authorities.”He speaks vaguely of trying to “find a way to identify those locations that have the best chance of sustaining a viable tennis programme in the longer term”. This is all well and good but kids passing dilapidated council courts with no net and grass shooting up between cement cracks are probably going to keep walking, towards something more attractive.The LTA is subsidising costs for parents of gifted young players, meanwhile, through the two academies it announced last week, at Loughborough and Stirling University.“I know the LTA hasn’t been consistent enough in this respect in the past,” Lloyd confesses, “and I know we need to get it right. I’m fortunate enough to have come through the county and the regional system and to have seen academies like the Slater Squad which Tim Henman and Jamie Delgado came through. I saw how those academies could create the type of environments to foster success.”It is a start. Maybe. Or, rather, a restart. The LTA has tried for years to broaden its base and its appeal. In Lloyd the game at least has an energetic leader, who played the game and is prepared to knock some heads together. He says he is in it for the long haul. So did Michael Downey, the Canadian who left after three years. It is not going to be an easy ride. But it will almost certainly be an interesting one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5671f6ee8fe48204d78d2dedbc1b8a518222a7d0/0_0_4261_2791/master/4261.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d6e77a73754db5fa812a7b0374a83c63 2020w","title":"aleksandr kogan facebook cambridge analytica senate testimony","story":"Aleksandr Kogan, who harvested Facebook profiles, dismisses idea as ‘science fiction’ during Senate hearingThe academic researcher who harvested personal data from Facebook for a political consultancy firm said Tuesday that the idea the data was useful in swaying voters’ decisions was “science fiction”.“People may feel angry and violated if they think their data was used in some kind of mind-control project,” Aleksandr Kogan, the now notorious Cambridge University psychologist whose app collected data on up to 87 million Facebook users, said during a US senate hearing. “This is science fiction. The data is entirely ineffective.”Kogan’s appearance before the Senate comes three months after the revelation that he had transferred his giant dataset to Cambridge Analytica, a now defunct political consultancy that worked on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The scandal set off political shockwaves in the US and UK.The academic was portrayed as a liar and a fraud by Facebook when news of the data harvest broke in March. Kogan has pushed back, arguing in the press and before parliament that he was being scapegoated for behavior that was normal and that Facebook did nothing to prevent. At the hearing on Tuesday, Kogan repeatedly took aim at the field of research – psychometrics – that Cambridge Analytica claimed it could use to predict voters’ psychological traits and influence their votes. “If the goal of Cambridge Analtyica was to show personalized advertisements on Facebook, then what they did was stupid,” Kogan said, arguing that it is much more effective for any advertiser to use Facebook’s own advertising targeting tools. Kogan’s dismissal of psychometrics’ predictive value is certain to irk his former colleagues at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers with the renowned program published a widely cited study showing that Facebook likes could be used to predict a wide array of personality traits. Whether the ability to predict certain traits can be translated into psychologically tailored advertisements is very much open to debate, however, and Kogan is by no means alone in questioning the efficacy of Cambridge Analytica’s targeting practices. The researcher, who studied prosociality and wellbeing before leaving academia to pursue commercial opportunities, also lobbed criticisms at Facebook for its addictive nature.“I think it’s pretty clear that Facebook is in the business of trying to keep you on Facebook as long as possible,” he said. “The model does run counter not only to our privacy but to our wellbeing.” Though Facebook has instituted a number of reforms to its privacy practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analtyica scandal, Tuesday’s hearing was a sign that for some US lawmakers at least, there remains an appetite to regulate internet platforms. “Americans deserve no less privacy than Europeans,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, during his opening remarks, in reference to the EU’s new data privacy protections.Also appearing before the subcommittee were John Battelle and Ashkan Soltani. Batelle, a veteran media entrepreneur who is chairman of an ad tech company and serves on the board of directors of data brokerage Acxiom, said Facebook was incapable of addressing “the externalities it has created”. He argued for a light touch on regulation, however, saying “The wrong conclusion to draw from Cambridge Analytica is that entities like Facebook must build higher walls around their data.” Soltani, an independent privacy researcher who served as chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) during the Obama administration, said that he believed Facebook had violated its 2011 consent decree with the FTC and that there was a “strong likelihood” the body would impose fines against the company. “I have no doubt that Facebook has violated its consent decree,” said Blumenthal. “The only question now is what should be done about it.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57b5cd44923a314d1a1bd0517f227e88555a5e74/731_0_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d645812a823f12b8fecc277d3f22c33e","title":"matt hancock schools across the uk should ban mobile phones","story":"The culture secretary who heads up the digital brief says tech makes parenting harderThe culture secretary has called on more schools to ban mobile phones.Matt Hancock said he admired those headteachers who did not allow their use during the school day and linked social media use with the problem of bullying among young children.Hancock told the  last week that he does not allow his children to have their own phones or to use social media, but dismissed the idea of legislating to stop their use in schools.And, he returned to the subject in an article for Wednesday’s Daily , in which he put the onus on headteachers. He said: “Technology makes being a parent much harder. And schools have a big role too. I enthusiastically support using technology for teaching. But we also need to teach children how to stay safe with technology. Why do young children need phones in schools?“There are a number of schools across the country that simply don’t allow them. I believe that very young children don’t need to have access to social media. While it is up to inidual schools to decide rather than government, I admire headteachers who do not allow mobiles to be used during the school day. I encourage more schools to follow their lead. The evidence is that banning phones in schools works.“Studies have shown mobile phones can have a real impact on working memory and fluid intelligence, even if the phone is on a table or in a bag.”Laws governing children\u0027s relationship with technology vary around the world, and are rarely enforced. The de facto age for many online services is 13, set by the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act in 1998, which prevents sites from targeting children, or knowingly allowing children to provide information online without parental consent. The burden of garnering that consent and the low returns for building services for children has meant, however, that providers tended to turn a blind eye to under-13s on their site, neither catering for them nor expending the effort required to police against their presence.That said, tech aimed more explicitly at children has blossomed recently, and legislation that aims to protect children from potential harm have also been passed. Schoolchildren in France are barred by law from using their phones in the classroom and, from September this year, from using their phones in school at all.Such laws are countered by efforts on the part of companies such as Facebook and Google to attract new users while they’re young. Facebook offers Messenger Kids, which allows children to speak to contacts vetted by their parents, while Google’s YouTube has a Kids app that offers copious parental controls and the ability to filter videos for all but the most child-safe content – although the filters, which are run by an algorithm,\u0026nbsphaven’t always been successful, prompting the company to\u0026nbspannounce a human-curated version\u0026nbspin April.Last week, Hancock – whose brief includes digital policy – told the  he believed “parents have a responsibility to ensure that children use technology appropriately. For instance, I allow my children to do their homework online, but I don’t let them on to social media”.He added: “They don’t have access to the devices. They don’t have phones. Why do they need phones? They’re children, they’re 11.”Hancock said the government had a responsibility to ensure internet companies “properly police their own terms and conditions”. But he dismissed suggestions the UK government should follow the lead of its French counterpart, which has banned mobile phones on school premises.In his  article, Hancock said: “Modern digital technology is a powerful force for good ... But with all of the exciting doors that the internet opens, like any new technology it brings challenges, especially for our children.“We all recognise children need more protection on the internet. If a child is being bullied during the day and they have access to social media, the bullying doesn’t necessarily stop when they walk out of the school gate. I want bullying to be as unacceptable online as it is in the playground.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24a2561f5c37964dd323606a33b250bb62be9a69/0_498_4424_2655/master/4424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6458f37b48a6b9aeb1696dacfcb9e324","title":"italy coalition rift roma register matteo salvini","story":"Matteo Salvini shrugs off critics who say policy reminiscent of fascist pastMatteo Salvini vowed to turn “words into action” in his drive to root out and expel thousands of nomadic Roma from Italy as he shrugged off critics who said the far-right interior minister was adopting illegal policies reminiscent of the country’s fascist past.Salvini, who has seen a jump in his approval ratings in the little under three weeks he has been in office, has called for a new census of Roma and for all non-Italian Roma to be expelled from the country. He also praised on Twitter the demolition of an “illegal” house used by Roma in Turin - which had been ordered by a local council controlled by Salvini’s League party - even as he was condemned by rival politicians and a top Jewish leader.Salvini’s move against the Roma comes amid a hard line against migrants into Europe, which last week saw him to refuse to allow a ship carrying more than 600 people rescued from Mediterranean from docking in Italy, forcing it to ert to Spain.The developments in Italy have caused the first major rift between Salvini and his Five Star Movement coalition partner. Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment M5S, called Salvini’s order for the creation of a new Roma registry “unconstitutional”. A similar census pitched by the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was blocked by an Italian court.It was also lambasted by Noemi Di Segni, the president of Italy’s union of Jewish communities, who said the proposal recalled the fascist race laws of the late 1920s and 1930s. The former centre-left prime minister Paolo Gentiloni also tweeted his disgust, saying: “Yesterday the refugees, today the Roma, tomorrow guns for all.”At first, Salvini seemed prepared to back down from his new policy but in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon he promised to stand by his call for mass expulsions.“I don’t quit and we’re moving forward,” he said in a tweet. He also pointed to a 2012 proposal by politicians in Milan, which included a call for a census of the Roma community in the city. That register, according to an article in Corriere della Sera, was part of a project to help families and children overcome “discrimination and the denial of dignity” and opposing “irregularity and illegality”. Salvini said such proposals were deemed good when they came from the left, but racist when they were proposed by him. “Italians and their security comes first,” he wrote. The row is the first sign of a potentially serious split between Salvini and Di Maio, who has been overshadowed in the first weeks of government and appears eager to rein in the far-right leader. The two parties – Salvini’s League and Di Maio’s M5S – are both populist, but the League has tended to be much more outspoken about its xenophobic and racist attitudes towards migrants and non-Italians.Salvini’s intense focus on immigration and “foreigners” has collided with M5S’s priorities of economic fairness and labour policy. The Roma community has long been a target of Salvini, whose rise to prominence often involved press appearances at Roma camps, which he has frequently threatened to raze. Few minorities are treated with as much contempt in Italy as the Roma, who face prejudice and stereotypes that are deeply ingrained in the social consciousness. On Monday Salvini ordered the census and the removal of all non-Italian Roma – which he called an “answer to the Roma question” – and said he wanted to know “who, and how many” there were. “Unfortunately we will have to keep the Italian Roma because we can’t expel them,” Salvini said on Telelombardia.Salvini is on record as having praised Benito Mussolini, the Italian fascist leader, and his new policy has sparked comparisons by the centre-left Democratic party to ethnic cleansing rules introduced in the late 1920s that also targeted the Roma.“The interior minister does not seem to know that a census on the basis of ethnicity is not permitted by the law,” Carlo Stasolla, president of the Associazione 21 Luglio, which supports Roma rights, told the Ansa news agency. “We also recall that Italian Roma have been present in our country for at least half a century and sometimes they are ‘more Italian’ than many of our fellow citizens.”Francesco Palermo, a former senator in Italy and human rights expert who has defended the rights of Roma, said it would be legally impossible to pursue the creation of an ethnic-specific census and expulsions as Salvini described, because the issue had already been taken up by Italian courts in the past, where it was rejected.But he said the bigger problem was that the reaction to Salvini was generally positive, and that his popularity was growing despite the extreme nature of his positions.“It is very simple and very scary. Except for intellectuals and certain journalists, most people would say there is nothing wrong with this, and that is the tricky point. Salvini knows this. It is a just a means to get political support,” Palermo said.He added that reactions would be different if Salvini was targeting other groups of people who face discrimination, but that racist views about the Roma are “innate” among many people in Italy.Salvini’s actions were also denounced by Roberto Speranza, a lawmaker for the leftwing Freedom and Equality group, who said he had reported the interior minister for inciting racial hatred. “Enough is enough,” Speranza said.About 4,000 Roma live in state-sanctioned ghettos in Rome, according to a 2013 report by Amnesty International. These out-of-city ghettoes consist of pre-fabricated containers or mobile homes in fenced-off areas, often without adequate sanitation or clean drinking water. Inhabitants are excluded from other social housing despite many having lived in Italy for generations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5de203bf3bb65ded1559e73419481e8b934d4b45/40_0_1013_608/master/1013.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93daba6b3d8439c52b0d563ce0b20a84","title":"saudi backed yemeni forces capture hodeidah airport","story":"Military advance comes after UN envoy fails to broker ceasefire with Houthi rebelsSaudi-backed Yemeni government forces have captured the airport at Hodeidah and have started preparations for the more complex task of capturing the city and its port nine miles (15km) to the north. The port is critical to the supply of aid to the rest of the famine-struck country.Confirmation that the airport on the southern outskirts of the city had been seized after three days of fighting came from both TV pictures and eyewitness accounts. At least 40 Houthi fighters who had held the airport were killed, but most retreated into the city, preparing to fight a potentially intense street-by-street campaign that could endanger tens of thousands of civilians.The military advance came after the UN special envoy for Syria, Martin Griffiths, left the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, after failing to broker a ceasefire that would have seen the port taken under UN control. Griffiths provided a closed-door briefing to the UN security council by satellite link on Monday, but departed Sana’a without speaking to the press.The security council has been ided over whether to demand a ceasefire, and Russia, its current chair, gave a downbeat assessment of the chances for a diplomatic breakthrough after the meeting. Most western states oppose the Iranian-backed Houthi takeover of Yemen, but also assert a military solution to the civil war is not possible.The Saudi and UAE forces that are providing military support to the campaign by the Yemeni government led by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to win back control of the port insisted Houthi surrender had to be unconditional, rejecting proposals that the rebels remain in the city, but the port could be placed under UN control. The port is currently functioning.The UAE insists it has elaborate contingency aid plans in place if the battle for the port is either prolonged or leads to damage to its infrastructure, so interrupting the supply of food, water and fuel.But the International Rescue Committee said these assurances were little but “a publicity stunt meant to draw attention away from the undue suffering the attack is causing”.Amanda Catanzano, the aid agency’s policy director said: “The so-called relief plan announced by the Arab coalition in Yemen must be seen for exactly what it is a justification to launch an attack that will have catastrophic consequences. The modalities for the delivery of this plan are vague, and the plan alone will not address the underlying causes of conflict in Hodeidah, nor the level of humanitarian need that will be created by a siege or attack on the port and the city itself.“Nobody following this war for the past three plus years can believe that the Saudi coalition has any intention of prioritising the wellbeing of Yemeni civilians. The Hadi government, backed by this coalition, has been in control in Aden and other areas in southern Yemen for three years, yet, innocent Yemeni civilians living in these areas continue to suffer from a total lack of basic healthcare and critical life-saving services.”According to the International Organisation for Migration, 76,000 people have been displaced across the 13 districts of the Hodeidah governorate since the Saudi-led advance began. The numbers that have left the city itself is put as low as 6,000, but many exit routes have been blocked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ad6e69028981a00d13cbd4f293ca61b2a22ba28/0_454_5241_3145/master/5241.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bb55cb522234772a993f067c0011988","title":"turkey elections president recep tayyip erdogan","story":"Despite dynamic opposition, Turkey’s president remains a powerful and popular incumbentAll along Istanbul’s boulevards, the face of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan looms large. For 16 years he has ruled over his country, victorious in election after election, vowing every time that Turkey is on the path to reclaiming its status as a great power in the Middle East and beyond.Turkey’s largest city is home to a variety of grandiose projects that channel this vision. In October, the government is scheduled to complete work on Istanbul’s third airport, which will serve 90 million passengers a year. A project to bypass the Bosphorus with new 28-mile (45km) waterway linking the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea – a project first proposed in the 16th century – will cost billions of dollars.Turkey is less than a week away from arguably its most important elections in modern history. The victor in the presidential race will assume an office with extraordinary powers, which were narrowly approved in a referendum last year, and rule until 2023 – the centennial of the republic’s founding from the ashes of the Ottoman empire.Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development (AK) party faces the prospect of losing its majority in parliament, but the 64-year-old, who has sought to position himself as a leader of the Muslim world as well as his country, is predicted to retain the presidency. He remains Turkey’s most popular and powerful politician despite an unexpectedly dynamic opposition.Independent polls suggest an easy victory in the first round, though without an outright majority, before more narrowly defeating a second-round challenger.Muharrem İnce, a physics teacher and the main secularist opposition candidate, is most likely to make it into the final round with Erdoğan. His lively campaign has drawn thousands of people to rallies across the country. He has vowed to overturn restrictions on fundamental freedoms and restore the rule of law in Turkey.Meral Akşener, the leader of a breakaway nationalist party, has energised young voters in her attempt to outflank Erdoğan from the right, while Selahattin Demirtaş, the charismatic Kurdish leader, is running a presidential campaign from his prison in Edirne. On Monday, he gave a groundbreaking televised speech from the jail calling on voters to reject one-person rule.However Erdoğan, often classed by human rights campaigners as a strongman leader alongside Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orbán, is likely to be re-elected. “Great Turkey wants a powerful leader,” say his election posters.That last claim is arguable. In the last major vote – the referendum on presidential powers – Erdoğan won by a razor-thin margin amid allegations of fraud. Altun said, however, that opposition leaders’ attempts to imitate Erdoğan proved he offered a good representation of Turkish society. İnce has a populist veneer to his speeches and occasionally adopts crowd-pleasing, anti-western slogans, such as vowing to close the İncirlik airbase used by the US if Washington fails to extradite Fethullah Gülen, a Pennsylvania-based preacher accused of masterminding the 2016 coup attempt. Mimicking the president’s religious piety, both Akşener and İnce have emphasised that they are personally devout.Erdoğan and the AK party’s promise to its voters has often rested on two pillars: economic growth and democratisation, which in effect has meant a greater voice for their once-beleaguered base. Supporters of the president admire his public piety, largely because it has allowed those who identify as devout Muslims to be part of mainstream society after decades of vilification by their secular countrymen and women.Under Erdoğan’s leadership, headscarves are allowed in parliament, universities and public buildings, a transformation that few of his supporters are likely to forget. “As a teenager in Ankara in the 1980s we couldn’t wear the headscarf at school,” said Ravza Kavakçi, an AK party MP. “So on the weekends or outside of school, if people didn’t insult me I would feel like I was invisible, I would worry that they could not see me.“But with the democratisation I was accepted as a human being. As a Muslim it didn’t matter what others said or did, I was accepted the way I was.”The economy, in the meantime, has suffered a few shocks. Youth unemployment remains high, and the value of the Turkish lira has plummeted against the dollar. But the strong leader image has left most voters convinced that only Erdoğan can fix what ails Turkey. Kiraz, a 55-year-old AK party voter, said she had little patience for opposition leaders claiming to be religious or wanting to save the country. She was sitting with friends in the courtyard of the Fatih mosque in Istanbul, named in honor of Mehmet the Conqueror, who wrested control of Constantinople from the Byzantines. She called the opposition presidential candidate İnce “a liar who will ruin everything”.“There are no lines in the hospitals, we have roads, parks, everything, what more do we want?” she asked.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsTánaiste Simon Coveney has accused the British government of “revisionism” on what it has already agreed on how to avoid a hard border, as he warned the Cabinet to expect a “very difficult” summer in the Brexit talks.Ministers discussed the current impasse in the Brexit negotiations at their weekly meeting, and ahead of the visit of a number of senior European Union figures to Dublin this week. Their visits are also in advance of the next meeting of the European Council next week.Mr Coveney gave the Cabinet a Brexit update in advance of the visit to Dublin of European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. It is also expected a phone call will be arranged with senior Government figures and European Council president Donald Tusk later this week.The Government had initially wanted “sufficient progress” on the Border backstop arrangement to be made by next week’s summit but has accepted that is now unlikely to happen until October. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has even suggested this may not happen until November.The backstop arrangement – under which Britain has committed to maintaining EU customs and trade rules in Northern Ireland in the absence of any overall agreement in order to maintain a soft border – is one of the main negotiating difficulties between the EU and the UK.Sources said the Cabinet was also told that a strong statement of support for Ireland will also be issued by the rest of the EU27 at the June summit. Senior figures in Dublin have suggested that the UK’s transition period after Brexit formally takes effect next March may be threatened.Meanwhile, European Commissioner for Agriculture Phil Hogan said patience with the British government was “wearing out” in Brussels over delays in proposing solutions for how to avoid a hard border in Ireland.The British government did not have a “coherent position” on what kind of Brexit deal they wanted, which has posed problems for EU negotiators, Mr Hogan told journalists in Brussels on Tuesday.Also in Brussels, the Brexit negotiators from the UK and the Commission Article 50 Task Force last night published a 14-page paper listing the areas on which they have reached agreement and where agreement is still needed in the draft withdrawal agreement. It is likely to form the basis of the report of the EU chief negotiator to next week’s EU summit.On the Northern Ireland protocol it notes that most of the work has been completed on the cross-Border bodies and programmes that have to be safeguarded and promises that “the finalised results of the North-South mapping exercise on cross-Border co-operation will be published shortly”.The paper says “both parties recognise” that work on the backstop “requires provisions in relation to customs and regulatory alignment”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The British Government do not have a “coherent position” on what kind of Brexit deal they want, which has posed problems for EU negotiators, Mr Hogan told journalists in Brussels on Tuesday. The comments come ahead of a key European Council summit of EU leaders next week. An initial deadline for the British government to make progress on how the Border “backstop” commitment would be achieved in time for the summit, is anticipated to be missed. The backstop was a commitment given last December, that if there was no deal reached on how to avoid a hard border, there would be no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Both Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney have said the backstop agreement would need to be “legally operable.”“If the United Kingdom continues the way they have been over the last number of months, without coming forward with proposals as promised, well then you’re facing the difficult situation of a no-deal,” Mr Hogan said. October is the deadline to agree an overall Brexit deal, as the European Parliament will need time to approve it. “We’re waiting for a long time for the United Kingdom to tell us precisely what they want out of these negotiations. . . They need to do so sooner rather than later, as time is getting short, and patience is wearing out,” Mr Hogan said.There was a “good understanding” of the political problems UK prime minister Theresa May faces within her party, in trying to agree what relationship Britain will have with the EU after they leave, he said. Mr Hogan said Ireland had achieved a “strong” position in the Brexit negotiations, aligning the other 26 Member States in making avoiding a hard border a necessity. “I have never seen such solidarity in the Commission on any issue, as I have seen in relation to the problems that this can create for Ireland,” he said. Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy said his party would be “disappointed” if the Irish Government failed to secure progress on the Border backstop at the June summit. “In an 11th hour negotiation, pressure would come on the Irish Government to accept a political statement”, rather than a legal text, he said. A political commitment to avoid a hard border would hold “zero value,” and would be a “major win” for British negotiators, Mr Carthy said.Charles Tannock, a pro-remain Conservative Party MEP, said the final Brexit agreement on the Border would have to be “watertight.” Mr Tannock warned there was a danger if the agreement was unpalatable to hard Brexiteers, some of “the crazies” in the Conservative Party would seek to remove Ms May and “tear up” the commitments after Brexit. Some quarters of the Conservative Party held the view Ireland was still akin to a “vassal state” that should follow the will of Britain, he told a media briefing of Irish journalists.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"queen knights garter hundreds line streets windsor greet royals","story":"Hundreds have watched the spectacle of the Queen and Knights of the Garter attending the Garter service at the chapel where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex marriedGosport hospital inquiry: Families to get answers over hundreds of painkiller deathsUnited States withdraws from UN human rights council as criticism mounts over border policyOne in every 110 people in the world forcibly displaced as Syria and Burma drive record refugee numbersWhen is the summer solstice?

It is the best tool the international community has to address impunity in an imperfect world and to advance many of our international goals.That’s why we will continue to support and champion it.Mrs Haley announced last year that Washington was reviewing its membership of the 47-country body.The US is halfway through a three-year term and its departure marks the first time that a sitting member would volunteer to step aside.Libya was suspended in 2011 after a government crackdown on unarmed protesters.  Under President George W Bush the US refused to join the Geneva-based forum when it was created in 2006, but did so after President Barack Obama took office in 2009.Established to promote human rights worldwide the council has passed more than 70 resolutions critical of Israel, 10 times as often as it has criticised Iran.The US move came as Donald Trump achieved his highest job rating since the first week of his presidency.For the first time since January 2017 he recorded an approval figure of 45 per cent in a weekly Gallup poll.It meant Mr Trump\u0027s popularity was exactly the same as Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan at the same stage of their presidencies, while Barack Obama was at 46 per cent.The poll was conducted over the course of last week and reflected a strengthening economy, falling unemployment, and the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.It was unclear how much the poll had been affected by a growing furore over a new zero tolerance policy of separating illegal immigrant parents from their children at the Mexican border.A separate Quinnipiac poll showed 66 per cent of Americans oppose the controversial policy, although 55 Per cent of Republicans support it.Donald Trump has faced fierce criticism for the so-called \u0026#34zero-tolerance\u0026#34 policy that forcibly removes children from their parentsThe policy means all illegal immigrants are now detained and prosecuted, and their children are removed and held in separate detention centres.The  UN human rights chief Zeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein criticised the policy on Monday, calling it unconscionable.Mrs Haley hit back on Tuesday, attacking the council for its own “hypocrisy”. The council’s current membership includes 14 countries that are ranked as “not free” by Freedom House: Afghanistan, Angola, Burundi, China, Cuba, Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.Once again, the United Nations shows its hypocrisy by calling out the United States while it ignores the reprehensible human rights records of several members of its own human rights council, she said.In the past, illegal immigrant families were caught and released while they awaited proceedings. Over a six-week period more than 2,000 children have been separated from their parents, and photographs have emerged of minors being held in wire mesh cages.A secretly recorded tape also emerged of Central American children at a detention centre in Texas crying and pleading for their parents as a guard joked: We have an orchestra here.Mr Trump on Tuesday said America was being infested by illegal immigrants and members of the MS-13 gang, and blamed Democrats for the crisis.He wrote on Twitter: Democrats are the problem. They don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our country, like MS-13. They can’t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters! We must always arrest people coming into our country illegally.People protest against the Trump administration policy of separating immigrant familiesAsked if Theresa May thought it was acceptable to cage children, the prime minster\u0027s spokesman said: The welfare and safeguarding of children is at the heart of our immigration policy. We do not separate child refugees or asylum seekers from their families.Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, dismissed comparisons to Nazi concentration camps. He told Fox News: Well, it\u0027s a real exaggeration, of course. In Nazi Germany, they were keeping the Jews from leaving the country.There was condemnation from all four living US former first ladies, and a host of senior Republicans including Senator John McCain. Ted Cruz, the high profile conservative Republican senator from Texas, also said he was horrified and that this has to stop.Mr Cruz said he was introducing a bill in Congress to allow illegal immigrant families to stay together in temporary shelters.Mr Trump was scheduled to meet with Republicans in Congress to discuss potential immigration bills on Tuesday night.  At a meeting for small business owners on Tuesday, he said: We want to solve this problem. I don\u0027t want children taken away from their parents.When you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally, which should happen, you have to take the children away.He said there were only two choices - totally open borders or criminal prosecution.Mr Trump said he was asking Congress for a third option.Democrats accused the president of using the separation of families as a negotiating tool as he sought to strong-arm them into supporting funding for a border wall.Meanwhile, more than $4.8 million was raised on Facebook to help separated families with legal services.It was the social network\u0027s largest ever fundraiser and those donating included chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.Please review our commenting policyGosport hospital inquiry: Families to get answers over hundreds of painkiller deathsOne in every 110 people in the world forcibly displaced as Syria and Burma drive record refugee numbersWhen is the summer solstice?

Mark Carney has previously warned that a central bank’s role is to deliver price stability not lasting prosperity.However, other central banks are targeted on measures other than inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia, for example, both have increased employment as part of their respective remits.The report\u0027s author, Graham Turner, chief economist at GFC Economics, will say: “There are deep-seated structural problems in the UK economy. Recent poor economic data underlines the scale of the difficulties. The UK is ill-prepared to face the challenges of life outside the European Union.Without major changes to economic policy, the UK will be marginalised, left behind by countries with higher levels of investment in technology.Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money welcomed the report but said the BoE\u0026nbspshould go further to boost the economy.“It is encouraging to see a major political party thinking seriously about the biggest challenges facing our economy, namely how UK finance can be reconfigured towards productive lending and investment, Ms Boait\u0026nbspsaid.“Particularly welcome is the report’s proposal to extend the Bank of England’s mandate so that it targets productivity growth.“However, in order to influence productivity growth, the Bank of England will require new tools to inject demand into the real economy. Such tools could include overt monetary financing, which would give the Bank the power to create new money which can be spent, via the Government, on productive investment in public goods such as infrastructure, house building, or social care.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mark Carney has previously warned that a central bank’s role is to deliver price stability not lasting prosperity.However, other central banks are targeted on measures other than inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia, for example, both have increased employment as part of their respective remits.The report\u0027s author, Graham Turner, chief economist at GFC Economics, will say: “There are deep-seated structural problems in the UK economy. Recent poor economic data underlines the scale of the difficulties. The UK is ill-prepared to face the challenges of life outside the European Union.Without major changes to economic policy, the UK will be marginalised, left behind by countries with higher levels of investment in technology.Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money welcomed the report but said the BoE\u0026nbspshould go further to boost the economy.“It is encouraging to see a major political party thinking seriously about the biggest challenges facing our economy, namely how UK finance can be reconfigured towards productive lending and investment, Ms Boait\u0026nbspsaid.“Particularly welcome is the report’s proposal to extend the Bank of England’s mandate so that it targets productivity growth.“However, in order to influence productivity growth, the Bank of England will require new tools to inject demand into the real economy. Such tools could include overt monetary financing, which would give the Bank the power to create new money which can be spent, via the Government, on productive investment in public goods such as infrastructure, house building, or social care.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Most agreements at summits are struck beforehand by backroom officials, and previous pre-cooked Brexit conclusions have been approved within minutes by leaders.It marks an escalation in the language by the national leaders and a warning shot across the PM\u0027s bow after months of deadlock.The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland.Ms May is also attending the Brussels summit – which is on the same day as the England vs Belgium World Cup match – but will be excluded from the section on Brexit. EU member states have since the start of the process said they do not want to negotiate with the PM directly, instead delegating the task to Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier.The news comes ahead of a House of Commons showdown for the Prime Minister on Wedneday, where she could be defeated on whether the Government must offer a truly meaningful vote to\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspon the state of talks at the end of the year – potentially opening the to her agreement with the EU being rejected.\u0026nbspMr Barnier warned on Tuesday in a speech in Vienna that the British government needed a dose of “realism” about what could be achieved in a deal between the EU and UK and that certain things would “no longer be possible” outside the bloc. He confirmed that Britain would not get direct access to EU-only criminal and security databases, the\u0026nbspEuropean Arrest Warrant, or be able to manage Europol or Eurojust after it left.Addressing “some in the UK”, he said: “They try to blame us for the consequences of their choice. Once again, we will not be drawn into this blame game. It will mean wasting time, and we don’t have time.”Talks have in part been deadlocked because the Prime Minister has limited room for manoeuvre in Westminster, with no majority for her party and hemmed in by Northern Irish unionists and Tory Eurosceptics on whom she relies to pass votes in the House of Commons.The UK earlier this month published a plan for a backstop solution to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, but EU officials immediately picked holes in the plan and said it raised more questions than it answered.A separate British government policy paper which will attempt to propose a long-term customs arrangement between the EU and UK as a whole has reportedly been delayed until July, after the June 28 and 29 summit. Next week\u0027s meeting is the last before the October Council meeting, which the EU says a deal must be agreed by in order to give time for ratification and approval.The draft European Council conclusions seen by The Independent say: “1) In light of the state of play presented by the Union negotiator, the European Council welcomes the further progress made on parts of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement.“2) The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland. It recalls the commitments undertaken by the UK in this respect in December 2017 and March 2018, and insists on the need for intensified efforts so that the Withdrawal Agreement, including its provisions on transition, can be concluded as soon as possible in order to come into effect on the date of withdrawal. It recalls that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

When the downpour finally came, it was worse than anyone feared.In just four days, Cox’s Bazar received two-thirds of the average rainfall expected in the month of June. More than 100 landslides have been reported, several people have died and hundreds of families have been made homeless, forced to sleep in mosques or crowd into shelters with their relatives.Ahead of World Refugee Day\u0026nbspon Wednesday, the UN released a report showing that the number of displaced people in the world has risen to a new record high of 68.5 million, and highlighting the plight of the Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar as one of the biggest drivers pushing up that number.But speaking from Cox’s Bazar in a break in the weather that has coincided with the end of the Ramadan fast, Caroline Gluck, a senior official with the UN’s refugee agency, said their message this year was to “celebrate” World Refugee Day as a tribute to those struggling through such hardship, and the charities fighting to help them.As is the case with the wider refugee crisis across the globe, the population of those displaced in Bangladesh is made up mostly of women and children. Aid workers have found that creating women-only centres for healthcare, counselling and childcare is having a dramatic impact on the Rohingya’s quality of life.Rohingya women and girls are taught sewing, play games, receive medical care and are offered counselling at women-only centres run by charities like IRC in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Jessica Wanless)“In any crisis, women and children are the most vulnerable,” Ms Gluck told The Independent - a problem only exacerbated as flooding and landslides cripple camp infrastructure. “Night-time can be a worrying time, particularly if you have to travel to use toilets. The camp is quite sprawled, and instead of living alongside people you know, you are living with strangers.”One of the charities providing women-only centres is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Dalia Al-Awqati, IRC’s emergency director in Bangladesh, said up to 80 per cent of the refugees are women and children and in need of “specialised support”.“Many Rohingya women and girls have been raped, seen their husbands and children killed before their eyes and lots of them are facing raising their children alone,” she told The Independent. “They live in a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of stigma and discrimination.”IRC\u0027s women-only centres (Jessica Wanless)For 12-year-old Azara, the centre is an oasis of normalcy in a situation that is anything but, and a welcome break from the boredom that comes with living in a refugee camp.She said she came to the centre every day, finding a safe space where she can make friends, play games and engage in her favourite pastime - henna.“It feels like home,” she said. “We come straight after we have been to school. Every week there is at least one day for sewing. Every week we learn something new. We love to learn.”Ex-UN ambassador says \u0027destroying Rohingya exceeds costs\u0027 for MyanmarRohingya facing \u0027crisis on top of crisis\u0027 as world looks other wayRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report alleges\u0027Bittersweet\u0027 Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced to flee their homesMs Gluck said centres like those run by the IRC were vital to encourage women “carrying the burden” of what happened to them in Myanmar to come forward and seek counselling and support, in what is traditionally a very culturally conservative society.Media reports have previously highlighted a spike in births nine months after the alleged brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s army in Rakhine state that forced the Rohingya to flee. The danger, Ms Gluck said, is that all pregnancies in the camp become stigmatised as potentially being the result of rape.And one of the biggest positives to come out of the creation of the centres has been the number of female volunteers working to foster new communities in their makeshift home.A lot of women are taking on jobs as safety volunteers or in counselling their fellow refugees directly, having received training from NGOs. “It has helped women to develop roles that they didn’t have back home,” Ms Gluck said.Senwara stands in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Timothy NesmithIRC)Senwara, a 35-year-old mother of four, is a volunteer who helps spread word about the centre to other refugees. She became the only female “Majhi” or community leader in her area of the camp after helping distribute food aid, and sees promoting the centre as part of her responsibility.“Women come here to this centre because there are no men,” she said. “If there were men, families would not let teenagers or women giving birth come here because they would feel shy. They are serious about this matter.”Ms Gluck said the few days of good weather, plus celebrations around Eid, had brought “joy to many faces” in the camps. There is an upbeat mood also to coincide with World Refugee Day, with singing, volleyball and other competitions put on to showcase the best of life in the camps.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya

He added that the dossier would involve a “census of Roma in Italy” which would “see who, how, how many”. He added: “Unfortunately, you need to keep Italian Roma in Italy.”The country\u0026nbspis estimated to be home to between 100,000 and 180,000 Roma.The minister’s actions drew criticism from human rights groups and opposition politicians.“The way is short from a census to a concentration camp.

Its\u0026nbspforces have been active in Syria for more than\u0026nbspa year and have just started going into Manbij, a town which used to be held by the Kurds.The operations are spreading further, with Ankara announcing air strikes in northern Iraq, close to Iran, on PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) bases in Qandil in which 26 fighters were “neutralised” late last week.Meanwhile, the crackdown following the failed putsch of two years ago continues.More than 100 new arrest warrants were issued just this week for those allegedly involved in the plot which had been blamed by the government on the exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen.Those named as wanted in this latest round include diplomats, army imams and academics, including Mehmet Kanter, a professor, whose son Enes is an NBA basketball player with the New York Knicks.More than 50,000 people remain detained another 140,000 have been fired or suspended from their jobs.Turkish President Erdogan attends the funeral service for victims

of President Erdogan celebrate in Ankara following the suppression of the attempted coupIt is the volatile political and security situation, as well as the economic situation, which Mr Erdogan says has led him to call an early election to ensure that the country has a firm and stable government as it passes through troubled waters.A referendum passed last year changing the constitution will concentrate authority in the office of the president, at the expense of parliament and the judiciary.The president has called the election “a milestone” in which victory will enable Turkey “to take the stage as a global power”.Problems at home and abroad meant “that it is paramount for Turkey to overcome uncertainty”, with the polls called 17 months before they were scheduled.There are, however, signs that Mr Erdogan may have overestimated the desire of Turks to be saved by him.The referendum result last year was narrower than expected and the opposition is buoyed by what they see as increasing signs of “E-fatigue”,\u0026nbspbrought about by a turbulent few years which has seen the short-lived coup followed by ferocious retribution, as well as terrorist attacks, the restarting of the Kurdish wars, and a president following a Trump-like policy of confrontation with his domestic and international opponents.The opposition parties, slowly coping with the shock of the draconian measures, with many of their members in prison, are showing a hitherto rare willingness to cooperate on strategy.There is now a chance that Mr Erdogan will not get the 50 per cent necessary for an outright victory, forcing him into a second round run-off.There is also the distinct possibility that the coalition of opposition parties will be able to loosen the grip of the president’s\u0026nbspJustice and Development Party (AKP)\u0026nbspin parliament and push back on some of the measures it has enacted.The opposition parties have decided to embrace the few opportunities they have been allowed on\u0026nbspthe airwaves.Selahattin Demirtas, the candidate for the pro-Kurdish HDP (Peoples’ Democratic Party) has been running his campaign from prison where he has already spent 20 months on security charges which carry\u0026nbspa sentence of 142 years on conviction.In a 10-minute address through state broadcaster TRT, to which he is entitled to under election law, Mr Demirtas said: “The only reason why I am here is that the AKP is scared of me. They think tying my hands here and going from square to square spreading accusations about me is being courageous. They are openly violating the constitution by declaring me guilty, even though there is no conviction against me.”Ozil and Gundogan criticised for posing with Turkish President ErdoganErdogan calls surprise early vote in June in bid to consolidate powerErdogan vows to keep fighting Kurds in Afrin despite UN ceasefireWhy has Erdogan released the genealogy of thousands of Turks?“In this election, give light, hope, peace and confidence a chance, not darkness, fear or nightmare. Let’s believe we can do this, and do this together.“I have no doubt that I will be acquitted in front of the law as soon as possible, as long as the judicial authorities follow the law and not the government’s expectations.”Muharrem Ince, the candidate for the CHP (Republican People’s Party) of Kemal Ataturk, broke with his party’s hierarchy when it voted with the government to lift parliamentary immunity in 2016 from Mr Demirtas and other members of the HDP, for its alleged link with the militant PKK.“How could you eliminate immunity in such a climate in which the judiciary has become subservient to the government?” he asked recently, while pointing out that his forecast, that members of other parties would follow those of the HDP to be persecuted, has turned out to be true.He has visited Mr Demirtas in prison to show solidarity and discuss tactics for the campaign.Mr Ince, a former physics teacher, has challenged Mr Erdogan’s narrative that he alone represents Turkey’s working people against a feckless, Westernised elite, sometimes referred to as the “White Turks”.The CHP candidate’s family comes from a village away from the urban elite and some of the female members wear headscarves.“Erdogan is the White Turk, I am the coloured of Turkey, Erdogan is from the palace, I am from the poor,” he said at a rally in Istanbul.“I am the man who fights the bosses, I am the reformer, while Erdogan is the supporter of the status quo.”Mr Ince has also repeatedly accused Mr Erdogan of calling an early election because a devastating economic crisis will unfold in the near future.“What is he afraid of? Why did he call a snap poll? Because an economic crisis is at our doorstep and he knows it. This tired man cannot weather this crisis. We will go bankrupt, Turkey needs fresh blood,” declared Mr Ince.Mr Erdogan and his ministers have sought to blame the economic travails, and especially the steady fall in the value of the lira, on an international conspiracy.This has been effective to an extent, certainly among his followers. A recent poll shows that 65 per cent of AKP supporters believe that the decline of the national currency was due to “an operation against Turkey by foreign powers”.Mr Erdogan had urged his supporters to defend the lira by selling dollars, euros and gold. This was enthusiastically followed up by some. A district mayor gave a week’s holiday to municipal workers who sold more than 500 US dollars a carpet dealer offered free rugs to anyone who exchanged more than 2,000 US dollars, and a surgeon offered, not free treatment, but free horse rides to anyone who presented a receipt from currency-exchange offices.What is he afraid of? Why did he call a snap poll? Because an economic crisis is at our doorstep and he knows it. This\u0026nbsptired\u0026nbspman cannot weather this crisisMr Erdogan has been repeating his argument for popular economic defence, saying at a recent gathering: “We’re aware of the games being played against us... Here is my request to the people, do not believe in rumours and protect your currency.”But many of those who made the foreign currency gesture now face acute hardship with the lira’s collapse.Cenk Katirci, an Istanbul businessman in the construction sector, changed “a big amount” of US dollars because he felt “patriotic and wanted to help my country”.But his building materials are linked to imports denominated in dollars and costs have sky-rocketed.“I take a hit, but I need to pass on some of these extra costs to my customers and they don’t want to pay, so business is not good,” said a dispirited Mr Katirci.“People don’t have so much money and they have been affected by what has been happening now for the last two years.”An AKP voter in the last two elections, he remains undecided this time.“I like what Ince is saying, he seems to speak for ordinary people. But this coalition of theirs has parties with different ideologies, will they speak with one voice?”In the second round, for the sake of our democracy, our country, the opposition should leave aside its bickering and support the opposition candidate, whoever it isMeral Aksener, the candidate for the iYi (Good Party) points out that the opposition coalition is unified on fundamental issues of preserving essential freedoms and civil rights.“We are making an effort to make the law operate in an equal, impartial and objective manner for everyone,”\u0026nbspshe said.“We think the pre-trial detention of politicians, intellectuals and journalists is not right and this is something we are fighting against.”“In the first round, everyone should vote for their own candidate. In the second round, for the sake of our democracy, our country, the opposition should leave aside its bickering and support the opposition candidate, whoever it is.“Let’s remember, this election is one of the most important in our country’s history.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The remainder were undecided.Northern Ireland voted 57 percent in favour of Remaining in the EUHowever, despite the growing support for Irish unification in Northern Ireland, voters in the Republic of Ireland appear more muted on the idea.Pollsters interviewed 1,500 adults in the Republic of Ireland between May 31 and June 5 as part of their wide-ranging report.Today\u0026rsquos poll discovered just over a third of voters in the Republic would like to see a united Ireland \u0026ldquoin the next few years.However, a majority said they agreed with the statement: \u0026ldquoI am in favour of a united Ireland in principle, but it would not be practical or affordable for the Republic of Ireland in the next few years.According to a new index, the EU27 countries fall into three groups: hard-core, hard and soft.

What can I take to ease awful shingles pain? Dr Barlow from the School of Applied Sciences at Edinburgh NapierHowever, one of their studies has now shown that a peptide found in the human immune system, known as cathelicidin, is \u0026ldquoincredibly effective at killing the flu virus at a level comparable with current anti-influenza drugs.The team now says they have investigated whether this same human cathelicidin peptide could kill rhinovirus \u0026ndash one of the most common cold germs. Dr Barlow, associate professor of Immunology and Infection and director of research of the School of Applied Sciences at the university, said yesterday that they were \u0026ldquoexcited to find that it did. He said: \u0026ldquoWe found that cathelicidins from other animals such as pigs were very effective at killing this human virus, too, raising the prospect that peptides from the immune systems of other mammals could be employed to fight this infection. \u0026ldquoThis is just the first step in a long path. Now, we hope to modify these peptides to make them more stable and effective, not only against rhinovirus and influenza but also against other varieties of cold virus.\u0026ldquoSo far, all our work has only been at the lab bench and against only one common strain of rhinovirus: the next step will be to progress into animal and finally -human clinical trials.Dr Barlow said his team\u0026rsquos approach is \u0026ldquoprobably about five to 10 years from potentially producing a viable treatment.Detox: How to detoxify your body and kick start your weight lose plan for a healthy 2018.

Mr McLean added: \u0026ldquoObviously it shouldn\u0026rsquot be a case of \u0026lsquowork until you drop\u0026rsquo but certainly \u0026lsquowork for as long as you can\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoMost people are not going to have the sort of gold-plated final salary pension schemes available to them that their predecessors enjoyed, and they are almost certainly going to have to wait longer for the state pension to be paid to them.\u0026ldquoIn these circumstances, it makes financial sense to stay in work either full-time or part-time to benefit from the wages, plus the opportunity to save more andor build up a bigger private pension in the run-up to retirement.Keith Richards, the chief executive of The Personal Finance Society said: \u0026ldquoThe general retirement age of 65 was established many years ago but financial advisers now plan for life expectancy up until the age of 100.The fact is, people are living longer and will inevitably need more money to sustain themselves in older age.Pensions: Everything you need to know about your pension.

Going to work is also a great way of keeping active and engaged. Accessing your pension later in life is also no bad thing, rewarding workers with a higher income when they decide they have had enough of the nine to five.Former pensions minister Baroness Altmann added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos really important that older people can keep working if they want or need to.\u0026ldquoNot only should this improve their living standards and pension, it can also boost the economy.\u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot want to force people to work on if they are not well enough. But many enjoy part-time work as they get older to ensure they have ongoing social interaction and extra money to spend or save.The state pension age is currently 65 for men and is gradually increasing for women from 60 to 65.By October 2020, it will go up to 66 for both men and women before rising to 67 by the end of 2028.While the employment rates of 55-64 and 65-69-year-olds have improved, Britain lags behind many other countries when it comes to older people in work.There are considerable differences in employment rates of older workers across the country too, ranging from 75.3 per cent in the Southeast, to 63.2 per cent in Northern Ireland.The Canada Life survey had questioned more than 1,000 employees and found opinions were ided about Britain\u0026rsquos ageing workforce.More than a third (36 per cent) think older people will need to retrain or learn new skills to stay in work, but four in 10 (41 per cent) believe that having a mix of older and younger workers can be beneficial for both employees and employers alike.Older workers could pump \u0026pound180bn into economyJohn Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said: \u0026ldquoThe UK needs to pick up the pace in increasing employment for older workers.We need to keep up with the likes of Germany, which has climbed the rankings from 21st to 14th place in our Golden Age Index over the past 10 years.The UK has slipped from 20th to 21st. There are clear economic gains to be made from getting more over-55s into the workforce and \u0026ndash with automation advancing \u0026ndash it important we ensure older workers are able to participate fully in the UK jobs market.A Work and Pensions spokesman said: \u0026ldquoOlder people have a lot of life skills and experience to offer the workforce and are a major asset to employers.How will pensions, mortgages \u0026amp house prices be affected by Brexit?

Heres the truth about what youre actually entitled to.Employees are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) if you have started work for an employer, are sick for four days straight and earn £113 a week.You are not eligible if you are self-employed, have had SSP for 28 weeks, serve in the armed forces or are in legal custody - to name a few.If you meet the criteria, you can get £89.35 per week for up to 28 weeks but your employer may choose to pay you more.If you haven’t been given a contract or it’s not in there, you should ask your employer or check your staff handbook or intranet.A survey from Direct Line found 96 per cent of British workers do not know how much sick pay they are entitled to, the Mirror reported.It went on to say that more than 40 per cent of companies reduce salaries to SSP within two weeks.And one in six firms are reported to slash wages after just four days.Its important for people to be able to quickly secure sick notes or medical certificates when they’re unwell, said Direct Line head of life insurance Trevor Bush.Unfortunately yes, and Citizens Advice warned some businesses are exploiting confusion around the issue to avoid paying employees.It claims firms use tactics including cancelling shifts after staff have called in sick to appear as though they were not meant to be in that day.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice told Sun Online: Sick pay is a basic right which many workers are entitled to.Although some employers make genuine mistakes... others are trying to confuse people about their rights so they can get away with not paying up.If your boss says that you arent entitled to sick pay but you feel you are, ask them to fill in the government sick pay form explaining their reasons.Once theyve handed it back to you, contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on 0300 200 3200.

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa.

and men thinking of wearing loafers without socks have be warned they will be turned away.Rupert Adams from William Hill said: Ascot have tightened up the dress code for the royal meeting and many of the millennial generation might not even own socks.The good news is we have 500 special edition socks in our shop on the high street which is close enough that you should not miss any of the action."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414561556.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal ascot 2018 drinking races fans","story":"Well-heeled revellers kicked off the first day of the eagerly anticipated racing event with glasses of champagne and pints of lager as thousands flocked to have a flutter.Ladies donning colourful frocks and gents in top and tails were spotted racing to the Berkshire tracks many bars, as they enjoyed the highlight of the horse racing calendar.In a boisterous mood, some were happy to dance around and pose for photographers, while others preferred to enjoy their drinks on picnic blankets.Armed cops were spotted patrolling the event this morning, ahead of the arrivals of the Queen, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, and other senior royals.However, officers were also on the look-out for any violence between drunken punters – with 300,000 expected to attend over the four-day festival -

who hasnt been seen for almost three years - by not putting in place measures to keep him safe.The Court of Appeal heard that the boy was found in the back of a lorry in Kent in September 2015 with fifteen other young men or boys - six of whom were Vietnamese.Immigration authorities thought he was over 18 and he was detained, with plans to return him to Vietnam.But he told lawyers that he was just 15 and indicated he had been trafficked to the UK via Russia.Lawyers demanded that a package of arrangements should be put in place before he was released which would stop him falling back into the hands of his traffickers.Lord Justice Underhill said he believed that the material before the Secretary of State plainly justified a credible suspicion as at November 6 2015 that the young man was a victim of trafficking and also that he was at risk of being re-trafficked if proper protective measures were not taken.Despite this, he gave them a release address and was allowed to leave a detention centre.Police said he was later seen with another man at Gatwick railway station - and there was no record of him ever reaching the address given, which turned out to be a Buddhist temple.It was only four days later that lawyers found out he had been released.The Prime Minister has promised to make tackling modern slavery a key priority for her Government - but todays case happened under her watch while she was Home Secretary.Campaigners and whistle blowers have revealed dozens of cases of Vietnamese children who have been trafficked to the UK - many of them go on to work in makeshift drug factories growing cannabis.The anti-slavery commission highlighted the problem in a report in 2017, with 1,747 cases being referred to the National Crime Agency between 2009 and 2016.Official estimates suggest there are 20 to 30 million slaves in the modern world.Eight out of ten people trafficked every year are female and half are children.It is overwhelmingly likely that these children have been re-trafficked and are currently being exploited by the people who brought them here, the judgement said.The Courts judgement slammed officials for acting in breach of duty under the European Convention of Human Rights - and said they should have done more to protect him.The boy is believed to have been brought to the UK earlier that year by an agent, who approached him and told him he could earn more working abroad.But as payment for getting him to Britain, he would have to work - but he didnt know what the job was or for how long.Three other people who arrived with him have gone missing from care, and the whereabouts of others are unknown, and the lawyers acting on his behalf are concerned for his safety.The judge today said that the Home Office should look at the case and see whether any lessons could be learned from it.A Home Office spokesperson said of todays ruling.We are carefully considering this judgement.We are committed to doing everything possible to keep adults and children in our care safe, including those identified as potential victims of modern slavery.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s just the reality of it. But to have it right there in your face especially when I don’t eat meat is very confronting.“I gasped out loud when I saw it, and my son came running over to see what had happened.“He is a vegetarian by his own choice, and I really didn’t want him to see it as I know it would really scare him.“Luckily he didn’t see it as I hid it straight away.

Am just going on deck.The card is signed “Fisgig” a nickname for Sarah who was one of only 706 people who survived the sea disaster.The postcard is expected to draw a price of £20,000 when it is sold at auction in Warwick next month.Auctioneer and postcard expert Colin Such said: It is very important in that not many postcards have been reported being mailed from the Titanic.It will appeal to collectors of Titanic memorabilia of which there are plenty in this country and even more in the USA. If we get them interested that figure could be dwarfed.The Titanic story is of such interest because everyone has heard of the disaster.Sender Sarah was employed as a maid to the wealthy Allison family of Montreal, Canada.She travelled on the Titanic in first class with businessman Hudson Allison, his wife Bessie, their two children, Lorraine and Trevor and nursemaid Alice Cleaver.The family all died in the disaster except for baby Trevor who survived along with Sarah.Before boarding the Titanic, Ms Daniels had been staying in Birmingham with Ms Green.According to witness statements after the disaster, when the ship struck the iceberg Sarah pleaded with the Hudsons to join her on deck but they did not believe they were in any danger.Sarah was eventually rescued when the crew directed her to lifeboat Number 8 and she was rescued with baby Trevor.Her pen pal Ms Greens descendants Ralph and Stephen Wilkes from North London, are selling the postcard with research notes and its genealogy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They said they didn’t want a row with the union.”Labour MP John Woodcock said the agreement – coming at a time of mass cancellations on the rest of the network – defied belief.He stormed: “Paying drivers to sit in trains idly admiring the view while hundreds of services are being cancelled for lack of available staff sums up the dire state of our railways.“These crazy secret deals are straight back to the 1970s – Chris Grayling should be ashamed of himself for presiding over this fiasco.”Northern last night admitted it was a “short-term arrangement” following calls to “improve the rolling stock”. A spokesman refused to comment on deals with the unions.The revelation came as Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was forced to endure a “no confidence” vote in the Commons. He survived –by 305 votes to 285 – after a Labour-led debate which saw him slammed for his handling of the railways.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald called on the Cabinet minister to “step up and shoulder the blame” for his role in disrupting the lives of thousands of passengers, including those on Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR).Mr McDonald said he regretted having to table the motion, telling the Commons: “But given the totally unacceptable state of the railways, I felt I had a duty to passengers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There, he earned the nickname the Desert Fox for being a wily and aggressive commander.He achieved stunning victories against the Allies but they eventually emerged triumphant in 1943.He returned to Europe to oversee defenses in Normandy before taking part in the 1944 plot to kill Hitler by blowing up his Wolf’s Lair.Hitler survived and offered Rommel the choice of a trial or suicide. He took the latter option, killing himself using a cyanide pill in October 1944, aged 52.And last October students were condemned for wearing jackets with  I love rape and I love Vegas concerts written on them.Other messages on the jackets included F*** the Syrians and scrawls of Nazi swastikas.Oscar winning actress Emma Thompson’s son Tindyebwa Agaba said he encountered racism in his first year studying at the University - leading Thompson to describe Exeter as a fitting home for former BNP leader Nick Griffin."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414112789.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"3661\" width=\"4960","title":"theresa may taken eye off brexit ball","story":"As a slogan, Theresa May’s mantra ranks up there with our useless railway network’s infuriating security dirge: “See it. Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters. Do they too think we are all thick and racistNow we risk the horrifying prospect of remaining half-in, half-out of the EU, robbed of our vote, our hard-won rebate and £39billion in hard cash.The game may be lost by default to the dark forces of organised bureaucracy: The Civil Service, the BBC, EU pensioners such as Peter Mandelson and those faceless Eurocrats.We shot their fox in The Glorious Referendum, only to let them regroup and return as a pack of wolves with a scent of blood.They had to suck it up or risk choking on the toxic fumes.But I think it sounds more like the punchline to a particularly revolting joke which is unsuitable for a family newspaper like this.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister faces a showdown vote in the Commons today (20 June) over whether she should give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on Brexit. She\u0027s already been branded sneaky and unforgivable by her own MPs - all very exciting.  But we\u0027re at the stage of Brexit now where even the experts struggle to understand what\u0027s going on. So let us help you. What has actually happened? Why is it so important? And what happens next? Here\u0027s a basic guide.  Remain-backing MPs want a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and Brussels. If it\u0027s not good enough, they want the power to send Theresa May back to the negotiating table - instead of crashing out of the EU with no deal. They\u0027ll have the bare bones of this vote in October 2018. But with Brexit Day looming in March 2019, there\u0027s a big row over what happens after that vote. Remainers say MPs need actual power to decide what Theresa May does next if there\u0027s a meltdown, and there\u0027s still no deal everyone\u0027s happy with. Brexiteers say MPs would abuse this power to tie Mrs May\u0027s hands and \u0027stop Brexit\u0027. Why is this happening now?  The House of Lords created a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 by passing an amendment to the government\u0027s flagship EU Withdrawal Bill . That means Theresa May was forced to fight for her life to defeat it in the House of Commons - otherwise it will become law. The problem is, too many Tory MPs back the idea of a meaningful vote, so she\u0027s had to compromise. Who are the Tory rebels and why are they important?  There\u0027s a cluster of pro-EU Tory MPs, probably a couple of dozen, who are very concerned about the UK\u0027s Brexit plan. Theresa May has few enough MPs that if the rebels team up with Labour, the Lib Dems and SNP , they can defeat her. The key issue is what it will take to push the rebels over the cliff. For months now, the Tory MPs have preferred to work with the government by striking backroom deals instead of dealing actual defeats. Usually only a few ardent Remainers like Dominic Grieve, Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry put their heads over the parapet. But last week it erupted into open warfare after they thought they had a deal with Theresa May - only to be betrayed at the last moment. What do the rebels want?  The rebel plan, led by Dominic Grieve, starts with what everyone agrees on - letting MPs vote on the final Brexit deal this autumn. Then, however, there\u0027s a new step. If MPs or the EU haven\u0027t agreed the plan by 30 November 2018, Theresa May will have to draw up a new plan of what to do next - and ask MPs to approve it. Then, if there\u0027s still no political agreement by 15 February 2019, Theresa May has to hold another vote in the Commons - and this time it\u0027s crucial. In that final vote, MPs could explicitly force her what to do. What has Theresa May offered instead?  Rebels had agreed to compromise on their plan - a bit. But what the Prime Minister has offered is much, much more watered-down. Under her plan, if there\u0027s no agreement by 21 January 2019, she\u0027d have to draw up a plan of what she\u0027ll do next and MPs would vote on it. But crucially, this vote would have no power to actually approve or reject her plan. MPs would only vote to say they\u0027ve considered the matter, which doesn\u0027t really mean anything. And they would be unable to amend the motion they vote on to toughen it up. What happens next?  The House of Lords approved a version of the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 for a second time, and has sent it back to the House of Commons.  That means Theresa May faces a dramatic showdown when it returns to the House of Commons on Wednesday 20 June, at around 1.30pm. Rebels and Tory ministers will be locked in a furious debate to find a form of words they can all agree on. But after Theresa May let the rebels down once, they won\u0027t be fooled again. If she can\u0027t appease them this time, they could deal her a devastating defeat. Why will just a handful of MPs be crucial?

The party is officially against the \u0026pound14bn third runway, it was announced this morning. Yet Labour MPs will be allowed to vote whichever way they like in a House of Commons showdown next week. That suggests the plan is likely to pass - because enough Labour MPs are pro-expansion to back Theresa May\u0027s government. The Prime Minister is facing a rebellion from her Tory MPs who have their seats under the Heathrow flight path. But Jeremy Corbyn feared his own rebellion too, because many Labour MPs and powerful unions want a bigger airport for jobs and industry.  Today Labour unveiled its compromise. The party will officially oppose Heathrow\u0027s expansion plan because it fails four tests on the environment, noise, boosting capacity and helping the regions. But Labour also called for all parties to follow its lead and offer MPs a free vote on the issue. Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald claimed he reached the position after careful and rigorous consideration. What is the plan? Heathrow Airport, London, plans to build a third runway to the north west of its existing ones in a \u0026pound14bn project opening in 2026. See the plan in maps here. It\u0027s designed to solve a crisis in UK air capacity after decades of dithering and delay. Is approval final yet? No. An outline plan has been approved by the Tory Cabinet. But that plan still needs to pass a vote by MPs in late June or early July - and then go to full planning permission afterwards. What was the Plan B? The Heathrow third runway was chosen over two other plans, to expand Heathrow\u0027s current runway or expand Gatwick, in a public inquiry. Other plans, including Boris Johnson\u0027s preferred island airport in the Thames Estuary, did not make the shortlist. Why is it a political nightmare? Powerful MPs, many of them Tories, have seats in the Heathrow flight path so oppose expansion. And green groups say it will be an environmental disaster. How will Tories vote? Tory MPs will reportedly be forced to back the government in a \u0027whip\u0027. That would mean any MP voting against expansion, including Justine Greening, would have to formally rebel. And any minister voting against, which could include Boris Johnson, would need to resign. How will Labour vote? Labour officially oppose a third runway, but Labour MPs can choose whichever way thay want to vote. Unions back expansion while Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell is against, so the party is split. Will Theresa May lose the vote? It seems unlikely. Labour would have to unite formally against the project with Lib Dems and Tory rebels. Will it cost any public money? Heathrow bosses say no. But green groups say the knock-on costs will be felt in changes to the environment. He added: There are unanswered questions on the costs to the public purse and the deliverability of the project. We support vital investment in our country’s transport infrastructure, but every investment must be tested on whether it provides real value for money and sustainability. A third runway at Heathrow fails this test.” Theresa May will tell Tory MPs to back Heathrow expansion, but many are expected to rebel.  Boris Johnson is among top Tories who have campaigned against a bigger airport - once vowing to lie down in front of the bulldozers. But it\u0027s widely expected the Foreign Secretary will conveniently be away on business when the vote takes place. The Tory Cabinet approved the expansion plans earlier this month after years of wranglings and delays. Theresa May is hoping to push the airport plan through with the backing of the supportive SNP as well as some Labour MPs.

Following the tragedy in west London last June which took the lives of 72 people, all Premier Inn buildings over 18 metres tall underwent urgent tests to find out if the panels contained the same flammable materials that made the tower block a deathtrap. Now the firm will shell out millions of pounds updating the cladding on 12 of its hotels to ensure they all now meet Government building guidelines.  All of the properties will remain open during the building work after the firm said an independent expert has assured them the buildings are safe to continue using because of their “robust” safety measures, such as fire detectors and smoke alarms in every room. The list of hotels includes a brand new 10 storey building on the River Ouse in Bedford which opened in May 2017 - just days before the blaze tore through Grenfell. The Premier Inn hotel in Prime Minister Theresa May’s Maidenhead constituency, which she also opened, will also undergo work, alongside Bristol Lewins mead, Glasgow Buchannan Galleries, Hemel Hempstead Central, Brentford, Gatwick North Terminal, Heathrow Terminal four, Tottenham Hale, London Waterloo and Woking. Then Home Secretary, Mrs May opened the 124 room building in November 2015. Speaking at the official ribbon cutting, Mrs May said: I am very pleased to open this new hotel, which will bring more jobs and investment to Maidenhead and further support the rejuvenation of the town centre.  Premier Inn, which has over 750 hotels across Britain, spent \u0026pound9.8 million on the development of the hotel. Tests conducted last year found aluminium composite cladding, similar to that which caused the devastating fire in west London to spread faster. However, the hotel firm has stressed the cladding used on their hotels appeared to be less flammable than that used on Grenfell Tower. A spokesman for Premier Inn said: “We immediately and voluntarily took the decision to have our hotels with cladding over 18m assessed by independent fire safety experts in the days following the Grenfell tragedy.

He also claimed he was banned from Grosvenor Casino back nine years ago.  Both Rainbow Casino and Grosvenor Casino refused to comment when approached by BirminghamLive .  Now Balvinder has revealed his \u0027two corner fraction betting system\u0027 which he claims has made him tens of thousands of pounds in casinos throughout Europe.  The system sees Mr Sambhi play eight numbers by placing a chip on two \u0027corners\u0027. He waits 12 spins where the numbers 8, 9, 11, 12 AND 26, 27, 29, 30 do not win.

Mr Sambhi, 46, said: ‘‘I’ve never lost with my system and the casinos don’t like that. ‘‘They don’t want winners in their premises – just losers. “I even deliberately lose on some days to give the casino a little back so I am not seen as a constant winner.

In Little Red Riding Hood, they learn never to trust strangers and in Watership Down, they discover difficult themes of death and conflict. And in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl warns children about the dangers of greed through a series of unfortunate incidents, including drowning a child in a chocolate river and turning one into a giant blueberry. But bestselling children’s author Geraldine McCaughrean has hit out because she says such stories are no longer deemed acceptable for primary school kids.  She says: “With a book that’s going to be sold into schools you get a list of things that are unacceptable — no witches, no demons, no alcohol, no death, no religion. “It really does cut down what you can write about.” The 67-year-old, who received the CILIP Carnegie Medal, Britain’s oldest book award, adds: “It’s extraordinary because in preschool you can read fairytales in their original form and some of them are really scary and dark. “But you go to junior school and all of a sudden the fairytales that you read have been sanitised and cleaned up.” Under such rules The Worst Witch, The Hobbit and even Harry Potter would be banned from school libraries. But what about the lessons we can all learn from them? Here our columnists reveal the important morals they remember from the childhood book which may now be on the no-read list....  Paul Routledge On my bookshelf is a copy of Tom Sawyer, the children’s classic by American author Mark Twain. It’s a harum-scarum story of growing up in a 19th Century Mississippi river town, with a murder, slavery, running away and playing hooky from school.  I wanted to be like Tom: adventurous, getting into trouble, having best mates, pretending to be pirates and hiding in caves from the adults. Unfortunately, the book is a prize “for excellent work in Form IVA”, so I didn’t quite live up to the hero I so admired. I’ve tried to make up for it since, morphing into Huckleberry Finn. Brian Reade It makes me shudder to think of kids being deprived Roald Dahl’s books because someone has deemed them too subversive or adult. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory opened my eyes at the age of nine to the brutal inequalities of life.  The story of Charlie Bucket’s family living off cabbage soup and sleeping on the floor of a tiny hovel while outside gluttonous types like Augustus Gloop had everything fall into their lap simply because they were accidents of birth, helped form political views which have never left me. And he did it with such a wicked humour. How could such genius be anything other than a golden ticket to early inspiration? Rachael Bletchly In Frances Hodgson Burnett’s 1911 classic The Secret Garden, Mary, 10, is a sickly, withdrawn child living in India with her uncaring parents - until a cholera epidemic kills them and the servants, and she’s left to fend alone. Cheery, eh? It certainly gave me nightmares when I was 10. Eventually Mary is found and sent to live with her cold, widowed Uncle in his miserable English home. So, unsurprisingly, the kid has issues.  But this tale of misery blossoms into a story of hope when she discovers a secret walled garden, a pal, Dickon, and a crippled cousin Colin hidden in the back bedroom. Mary and Dickon wheel him into the garden which they tend until it blooms. Colin recovers, Uncle Archie’s heart is healed and we all get a life lesson about neglect and death, love and nurture. Aaaaah.... Kevin Maguire The Twits is a great life lesson that nasty people get their comeuppance when the world’s turned upside down. I read Roald Dahl’s classic to my kids and the spoiler alert is the heroes are a good samaritan Roly-Poly bird which didn’t fly by on the side and exploited Muggle-Wumps monkeys.  The villains are the Twit couple who come to a sticky end after receiving a taste of their own medicine. Like all nasty folk, they’re fundamentally stupid. Living in a house with no windows because they think they’re for looking in not out is a brilliant insight into closed minds. Parts are frightening but we learn from fear when goodness triumphs and the evil are vanquished. Siobhan McNally I say, chaps, this banning Enid Blyton in schools for writing about witches, an evil sandman and a Magic Faraway Tree is a beastly business. I grew up reading all of Blyton’s books, and I think they’re wizard. They never did me any harm… well except the time I blew myself up trying to make lashings of ginger beer, which taught me to never underestimate the active properties of dry yeast.  I also learned valuable life skills about tuck boxes, midnight feasts and apple pie beds (never mix all three or you’ll end up with crumble). But most of all it taught me how to spot an absolute rotter, or Jacob Rees-Mogg as he’s also known. Andy Dunn I’m in Russia at the moment where, in the time of my childhood years, Five Went To A Salt Mine if they read anything as subversive as an Enid Blyton book. Of course, Blyton is considered unsuitable reading by many at home, with some even reckoning her work is full of double entendres.  Complete nonsense. My favourite, Five Go To Billycock Hill, address modern-day issues of espionage and the media’s role in society. Honest. Anyway, life lessons you can learn from Enid? I’ve read her books to my daughter, who now has an inherent scepticism about posh kids. A valuable one, indeed. Sara Wallis When my six-year-old son took an interest in fairytales, I admit I worried he’d be waking me up in a cold sweat. Jack climbed up his beanstalk to face a giant who munched on little boys. Brer Rabbit was chased down a dark well. And don’t even get me started on the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood. But surely sugar-coating everything hampers the imagination?  I voraciously read CS Lewis’ Chronicles of Narnia as a child a dark series about a kingdom ruled by the evil white witch with talking lion Aslan the hero. There was death and destruction and I probably never noticed the religious subtext. But it taught me about friendship, adventure and right and wrong. You can’t feed the imagination without a few monsters under the bed. Ashleigh Rainbird I thought history lessons were “boring” at school, so my entire understanding of yesteryears came via the Horrible Histories series - and they were truly grim.

Relatives of Raymond Moore are convinced foul play surrounds his death. But police have said there were no suspicious circumstances and the coroner called his death an act of self harm. The 26-year-old factory worker was found hanged in a bedroom, but because there was no suicide note, or any recent mention from Mr Moore about wanting to die, coroner Andre Rebello said he could not make a suicide verdict.  When asked by the Liverpool Echo , Merseyside Police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Mr Moore’s death.   But Mr Moore\u0027s dad, Raymond Snr, said his son had excitedly spoken to him about the forthcoming Grand National and was also looking forward to going to stay with him in Wales.   He said: “He promised me he would never hang himself. We were so close. “I thought he’d be the one carrying me [in a coffin], not me carrying him. “It’s been two-and-a-half months since his death, and I’ve been crying every single day.” Mum Edith added: “I’d seen him the night before - he was bubbly and had a lot to look forward to.” Mr Moore’s family also pointed to their usually tidy son\u0027s trainers being found in different rooms in the house, not neatly lined up together, as evidence of a third party\u0027s involvement. The single man, who originally lived in St Helens, was found dead on April 9 at his sister\u0027s house on Waltham Road, Anfield. A medium amount of alcohol was found in his body, along with evidence of recent crack cocaine use. The coroner told the court, in Kirkdale, that he could not rule out a “cry for help”.

Mia Clark, 43, said the fanged creature was under her son Oliver\u0027s duvet when she went to change the sheets. She was stunned when she found the proper sinister spider on the mattress and now fears her children will be bitten.  The mum-of-two, from Chelmsford, told Essex Live that her family\u0027s home has been plagued by spiders and she suspects there\u0027s a nest nearby.   Mia, who was bitten by a spider last year, said: It\u0027s quite worrying to find one in your two-year-old\u0027s bed. It was just lucky he wasn’t in it. When I went to change his bed, I lifted the duvet up and the spider was on the mattress, a proper sinister one. Mia and her partner, Adam, 35, have found several spiders crawling around their home.  She said: There is something going on as they are increasing but it\u0027s difficult to find where the nest is. There must be one because I have seen baby spiders. They have intensified this year but I have got to do something about it - it\u0027s too much of a risk for my children. Last year, a neighbour told Mia they had found a false widow in their garage, which is connected to hers. She went in later that day, and that evening discovered her wrist had become swollen.  Mia said of the bite: I thought \u0027What on earth is that?\u0027 The next day it started to look infected and swollen. I went to the doctors saying I thought I was bitten and the doctor said I had been and gave me antibiotics. When the swelling went down you could see the two puncture wounds and as far as I am concerned that is what it was. Mia is allergic to penicillin, ibuprofen, walnuts, pollen and grass, and believes this is why she experienced a severe reaction to the spider bite. She fears her children could suffer a similar reaction if they are bitten.  The mum said she found two false widows last year, but over the past few weeks she has seen at least five in her home, including her bathroom, master bedroom and both of her children\u0027s bedrooms. She destroyed four of them and captured the one found in her son\u0027s bed. She kept it in a jar to show pest control. Luckily, her son hasn\u0027t accumulated a fear of spiders and was not traumatised from the event. Mia said: My son is little still and isn\u0027t scared of spiders. He was with me at the time when I found the false widow in his bed and I was trying to be calm in front of him and just said \u0027ooh there’s a spider\u0027.

Terrified Tracie Wright was forced to dial 101 when an eagle-eyed collector told her the German WW2 shell which he kids had been playing with could explode at any moment. Tracie, 49, thought she\u0027d bought an empty explosive shell and even planned to give it to one of her children to take to a school \u0027show and tell\u0027 lesson. But after being told the device could be live, a bomb disposal team swooped on her home to carry out a controlled explosion.  Tracie said: To be honest, I didn\u0027t really know what it was when I found it. It looked like an empty shell from World War One or Two. I\u0027d bought a load of boxes at an auction and it was in a box of miscellaneous stuff with things like a clock and bits and pieces - just collectables. When I got home we got it out of the box and I thought at first it was bit of concrete. I stuck it on eBay and a collector got in touch and said it looked real and could be live. I thought \u0027Oh my God\u0027, because my kids had been playing with it and chucking it round.  Tracie, from Spalding, Lincs., found the item at a bottle of a box of collectables she bought from an auction and compared it to other items online. But just hours after posting it for sale online, an eagle-eyed collector got in touch with her and told her it could be potentially lethal. I often buy things from auctions and markets and sell them for a bit more money and people always like to buy old military stuff, she said. So I stuck it on eBay and a collector got in touch and said it looked real and could be live. I immediately called 101 and they sent somebody round. Then they called for the bomb squad.  The missile is believed to have dated back to between the two World Wars and could have possibly contained a tracer round of bullets. This is a flammable material that ignites to produce a bright yet deadly trail of light towards a target. Tracie\u0027s children, Logan, 11, Antigone, 17, and Halle, 15, were desperate to watch the explosion but missed the action because they were at school. Logan wanted to be here when the bomb squad came round because he absolutely loves the military and police, Tracie added.  The bomb squad told me that if it was dead then the explosion would just be a small \u0027poof\u0027 and if it was live then it would be a \u0027bang\u0027 and it definitely went \u0027bang\u0027. It is just a good job they didn\u0027t have \u0027show and tell\u0027 at school because I definitely would have let him take it in. I just feel a bit sorry for the man who wanted to buy it because his old shell is now completely destroyed. "},{"url":null,"title":"not football fan here how","story":"AdvertorialNot a football fan?

THAT tournament in Russia which is dominating the airwaves will see 32 teams take part in 64 matches over the course of more than a month. That\u0027s a lot of joy if you love the sport… and a lot of matches to avoid if you don\u0027t. But let\u0027s not complain or grumble - let’s see this as an opportunity instead. For those who don’t love football, the international tournament presents the perfect chance to sample the lovely and amazing things on offer right here in the UK. Avoid: 24 June, England vs Panama  Unlike England’s opening match against Tunisia, their second match is at the weekend on a Sunday afternoon. This of course means excitement will be at fever pitch and the country will be talking about little else. For someone with less interest in football, that means escape will be necessary. And the spectacular beauty of the Lake District could be the solution - it gives you soul-nourishing views and less chance of having to watch a football match.  We recommend Scafell Pike in Cumbria. It\u0027s the highest mountain in England at 978m above sea level and an area of unbelievable beauty with countless campsites and other places to stay. We can\u0027t promise you\u0027ll avoid the football entirely, but there\u0027s a fair bet you can if you want to. Ideal for hiking, canoeing and climbing there\u0027s loads to do in the Lake District and lots of beauty to see. It\u0027s worth doing some water-based activities in the lake at the foot of Scafell Pike - it\u0027s England\u0027s deepest lake at 258 feet.  Mind you, it\u0027s dwarfed by the depth of Lock Morar in Scotland, which is 1,017 feet deep. It\u0027s worth mentioning that the deepest a human has dived in scuba gear is 1,090 feet! See, you\u0027ve already forgotten about the football and you haven\u0027t been yet...  Don\u0027t forget to take: The Aerobie Squidgie Disc , \u0026pound5.50, for a non-football activity to keep the family entertained. For camping you can’t beat the Halfords Vis a Vis Tent which is now \u0026pound60, was \u0026pound150 (save \u0026pound90). It\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends, with two separate bedrooms and a living area which provides some extra space for your essential kit.  Avoid: 28 June, England vs Belgium  Instead of sitting through England’s final group game, why not visit Wales instead? After all, the Welsh aren\u0027t in the tournament this time around, so they\u0027re likely to be as keen to ignore it as you. We specifically love the village of Llanwddyn, below, which, in the 1880s, was forever submerged when a new reservoir was created in the Vyrnwy valley. The purpose of Lake Vyrnwy was to supply Liverpool with fresh water, which is something it still does to this day. It\u0027s also a nature reserve and offers amazing access to nature - perfect for a picnic.  Look out for the gothic straining tower, which filters the water before it heads off toward Liverpool. There are also a number of RSPB hides around the lake, from which you can spot some of the birds which inhabit the area. You\u0027ll also find loads of excellent picnic spots to watch the world go by. A road runs around the perimeter of the reservoir too, which is often used by runners and could easily be great for a family bike ride, if everyone is confident on the road.   Don\u0027t forget to take: Picnics are a lot better when you’re comfortable, so grab the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket for everyone to sit on - now half price at \u0026pound10. Remember to take the Plastic Plates , Bowls , Plastic Set of Tumblers and Cutlery – all half price at \u0026pound3 each.    If you’re interested in cycling the road, the Carrera Parva Hybrid Bike will see you up even the toughest of hills, thanks to its larger 27.5 wheels and 21 speed Shimano Tourney gears. It\u0027s available in both men and women ’s configurations and is only \u0026pound210 (save \u0026pound90).    For the kids, good choices are the Apollo Kinx Junior Hybrid Bike ,  which has a cool floral design- or the racer red Apollo Vortice Junior Hybrid Bike . Both are currently reduced to just \u0026pound104 (was \u0026pound130, save \u0026pound26) and the Shimano 18 speed gears will let them fearlessly tackle every hill they encounter.  Avoid: 2 \u0026amp 3 July, potential England game in Last 16  Should England qualify from the group stage and make it to the knockout stage of the competition, this is where the wall-to-wall football coverage will go into overdrive, making it nigh on impossible to avoid discussion of England’s prospects. Instead, perhaps you should consider some of England\u0027s amazingly beautiful woodland.  Swinley Forest in Berkshire contains a set of exciting mountain bike trails that are fun for the whole family. There are three routes in total: a green for beginners, blue for more advanced cyclists and a red for proficient mountain bikers. It\u0027s the ideal day out for anyone who likes cycling more than football. An adventure playground and spaces to build your own fort finish off this ideal location for family fun.  Don\u0027t forget to take: Make the most of the Swinley Forest mountain bike trails on the Carrera Sulcata Mountain Bike - available for both men and women now \u0026pound340, was \u0026pound425 (save \u0026pound85). A hefty cycle offroad is going to make you really ready for a hearty lunch.   The kids will have no trouble keeping up on the Carrera Blast Junior Mountain Bike , \u0026pound260. It\u0027s a great choice for kids graduating up to their first mountain bike, with its lightweight junior fit Carrera alloy frame for a light and easy ride.   Alternatively, the Carrera Luna Junior Mountain Bike with 24 wheel is \u0026pound232, (was \u0026pound290, save \u0026pound58). It has a lightweight frame with 21 speed gears and a Suntour Alloy M3020 suspension fork to help take on all terrains.  Avoid: 6 \u0026amp 7 July, quarter-finals  Many experts expect England to reach the last eight of the tournament, which would make this their biggest match of the competition - and an excuse for a national festival of football. If that’s not for you, down in Cornwall, below, there are plenty of places to enjoy the outdoors, and specifically the beach. Usually free of TVs and thus the football, these beaches are a haven for the non-sports-fan, and the soft sand and crashing waves make it the ideal place to swim during the day and barbecue a little later.  Check before you light the charcoal but many Cornish beaches allow non-gas barbecues, as long as they are raised off the ground on legs. It\u0027s also often a requirement that you wait until the early evening to light up, so as not to annoy day visitors. Be considerate with the cooking and remember to take any mess home with you.  Some beaches allow cold ashes to be placed in a rubbish bag next to a bin, but please check with the council first.  Don\u0027t forget to take: The Halfords Briefcase BBQ , above, is the ideal companion for this trip and is currently half price at \u0026pound7.50. It folds up into a compact, convenient unit that will cook up more than enough food for a small family. Keep your sausages and pork pies beautifully cool in the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox , at just \u0026pound85, was \u0026pound110 (save \u0026pound25).  Avoid: 10 \u0026amp 11 July, semi finals  If England reach this stage, the country will be officially consumed by football fever. Like the Welsh, Scotland\u0027s national football team also didn\u0027t qualify this year. Therefore it\u0027s quite likely that avoiding it will be a lot easier north of Hadrian’s Wall. It\u0027s hard to imagine a place more relaxing than the Scottish Highlands. The best thing to do is enjoy the sights and play some games. Go armed with a frisbee and bundles of energy and you’ll have an amazing time breathing in clean, football-free air.  From camping to log cabins, there\u0027s loads of places to stay and countless walks, bike rides and distillery tours (there are eight in the area) to take.

Donning flamboyant hats and high stilettos, race-goers were snapped sharing laughs, drinks and romantic moments. Some were spotted walking around barefoot and a few had a snooze in the grass. Others supped straight from the Champagne bottle as they toasted a very British day out.  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were also at the famous venue to congratulate jockey Frankie Dettori after he won the St James\u0027s Palace Stakes.   The Duke of Sussex watched on as his new wife was pecked on the hand by Dettori, on the first of the five-day event this afternoon. The royal couple were presenting the jockey - who has been suspended after over-using his whip - with the glittering trophy following the 4.20pm race. The former actress and animal lover could be seen smiling and joking with the three-time British champion, before he lent in to plant a peck on her hand as they greeted one another. But husband Harry looked less than impressed, only finally cracking a smile after the winner let go of his wife\u0027s hand and lifted his prize.  The crowds of revellers also appeared to be having fun, with one woman appearing to have given up on her glass as she gripped a bottle of what looked like Champagne. Another lady was snapped appearing to help her friend out as she nearly fell over. Meanwhile, the excitement seemed to have got a bit too much for quite a few race-goers, who were pictured having a lie down on the grass.

Shadi Badawood, 36, is accused of verbally, physically and sexually abusing the woman, who was looked down on because she was not Saudi Arabian. The defendant, a Saudi national, is accused of attacking the woman in Hull while he was studying for a PhD in marketing at the city\u0027s university. Mr Badawood is on trial at Hull Crown Court and denies rape, controlling or coercive behaviour, and two allegations of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Opening the case, prosecutor Charlotte Baines said the allegations came to light after a friend of the complainant saw Mr Badawood chasing her through Pearson Park while she was hysterical. Police were called and Mr Badawood, of Pearson Park, west Hull, was arrested, Hull Daily Mail reports. The complainant was interviewed and said that because of her country of origin she was looked down on in terms of status compared to a Saudi Arabian national.  She claimed to have been raped by Mr Badawood when he tied her legs with a jacket belt so she could not move them. She also claimed that on another occasion, Mr Badawood hit her with a large water bottle because she would not give him her mobile phone. Describing how the alleged incident continued, Miss Baines said: He grabbed her by her clothes and started shaking her and then started to strangle her with both hands while she was on her stomach. He was strangling her so hard she could not breathe. Mr Badawood is then said to have told the woman he would not leave her alone unless he killed her or made her crazy. That incident allegedly caused bruising and swelling to the complainant\u0027s throat and face, which another friend saw when her scarf slipped, the court heard.

Sasikumar Vasan, from the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was enjoying a calm evening with his two friends, a man and woman, on the popular Sinquerim beach in Goa - a major tourist destination for beach lovers worldwide. The trio were sitting near a rocky stretch adjoining a creek which empties into the sea taking selfies when suddenly they were hit by a strong wave. While the waves pushed the other tourists further onto the bowl of the rocks, Sasikumar was swept away into the water.  Heartbreaking video recorded by other tourists show the moment his friends are pushed into the rocks while Sasikumar is taken by the strong waves. The friends, yet to be identified, somehow get back on their feet and carefully climb to safety, not realising Sasikumar is not following them. After somebody alerts them, the man looks behind to realise Sasikumar has been swept away. The two stand shell-shocked for almost 20 seconds, frantically looking at the sea to spot him before realising he is gone.  Police inspector Jivba Dalvi said: Two of the three tourists managed to come out but their friend was swept away by the strong waves. The victim\u0027s dead body was fished out later. In a similar incident which also occurred near a rocky outcrop at Baga beach, located in North Goa, a strong wave pulled Dinesh Kumar Ranganatha, 28, also a native of Tamil Nadu, into the sea, resulting in his drowning on the same day. Dinesh\u0027s body was fished out from the sea almost an hour after the tragic incident happened.

Stood underneath a sagging \u0026shymakeshift shelter, I look on as jagged bolts of lightning streak the black sky and the wind whips up. This temporary city, cobbled together in less than a year with bamboo poles, scraps of tarpaulin and twine, looks like it will be knocked down any instant. For the 700,000 Rohingya refugees here in Bangladesh – who have escaped the worst genocide of this century in neighbouring Myanmar – the storms I witness are just the beginning of a three-month nightmare.  Their temporary homes are directly in the path of the cyclones that plague this vulnerable region from now until September. After being tortured and raped – and seeing their relatives murdered by soldiers in Myanmar who torched their villages – they are now prey to landslides, floods and waterborne diseases. Scores of people have died in recent days, including a two-year-old boy after a mud wall collapsed on him. At a Red Cross field hospital on the edge of the seemingly never-ending Kutupalong camp is nine-month-old Mohammad Ayas.  The helpless little boy broke his thigh bone when he fell from one of the treacherous slopes between the shelters. Icelandic nurse Hildur Sveinsdottir – here for a one-month secondment from her normal A\u0026ampE job – tells me such accidents are soon expected to occur daily. Fractures are very regular for us,” Hildur says. “It’s unimaginable what it will be like in a few weeks. The number of people getting injured or being killed will rise a lot if they get a really bad cyclone. Their shelters will not stand up.”  Experts say more than 200,000 people are at high risk from landslides and floods in the coming monsoon months. More than 1,000 shelters have already been destroyed as rivers of brown water surge through the narrow alleys of the camp, an hour from Cox’s Bazar city, on the southeast coast of Bangladesh. Assisted by aid workers, the Rohingya are digging drainage ditches and reinforcing their shelters.  Despite the extraordinary hardship they have endured, everyone I come across is determined to make the best of an appalling situation. Trucks bearing stacks of bamboo arrive at temporary depots all day long. Many of those collecting the only building materials on offer are boys, straining to carry their heavy load. In many cases, their fathers were murdered in Myanmar. Their mothers guard their precious scrap of land and look after younger siblings.  More than half of the people here are women and at least 60% are under 18. Many of them will be trapped once the paths become impassable. Speaking next to a stagnant pool of fetid brown water, mum Moriom Katu, 35, tells me her eight-month-old son died from dysentery and diarrhoea a few weeks before. “This is our fate,” she says. “We were shot at, burned and tortured as we tried to get away, and now we are here in this terrible location. Everything is so dirty. The water is full of diseases. People are getting sick all the time.”  Now she is concerned that her surviving children, a girl aged seven and a boy aged four, will be struck down by the same illness. There is never a quiet moment for the dedicated Red Cross medics. Hildur says: “We have respiratory problems, malnutrition cases, dehydration and infections that turn to abscesses because the water they have to clean cuts with is dirty. “There has been measles and TB. They want to wash and they want to take care of themselves, but the hygiene is so bad.”  On the 15-bed paediatric ward is a premature baby so tiny that I inhale sharply when I first see her. Unbelievably, Umme Kulsul is two months old. Her arms and legs are the width of an adult finger, but she has grown. Hildur tells me she was just ten centimetres long when she was born by emergency caesarean when her mother, Annuar Begum, 30, was only seven months pregnant. This was due to serious health problems, \u0026shyexacerbated by the escape from Myanmar to Bangladesh.  Since then, Umme has needed 24-hour medical care, yet I am told that in just over a week she will have to go back to the family’s shelter in the squalid camp down the road. It is difficult to imagine how her tiny body will withstand the elements. Equally at risk is Abdullah, 22, whose left leg is encased in bandages. He was shot while trying to flee the military’s reign of terror in Myanmar. “They surrounded my village,” Abdullah tells me. “While some soldiers torched the straw roof of our house, others lay in wait to fire at us.  “We were all screaming but they kept shooting. I was shot in the leg. “The bullet pierced right through my thigh and came out the other side of my leg. My aunt and uncle were killed in the crossfire.” Abdullah’s wound became badly infected because of the unsanitary conditions in the camp, and Red Cross nurses are doing their best to save his leg from amputation. Yet when he returns to his shelter, his wound will be exposed again.

No one was an automatic pick, you had to play for your place.“Before he came to Dens Park it was like that, too many were.“When he came in there was a big clearout. He revolutionised the team.“A lot of the squad were ageing and just going through the motions at the end of their career.“At that time Dundee weren’t expected to do much, they were a big club but, after the success in the early 50s, there were a few years of doing not very much.“He also brought in some older guys who we all wondered about.“He brought in Bobby Wishart, who was 32 at the time, Bobby Seith was 30, but they were revelations.”Shankly also revolutionised the style of football on display at Dens Park.“We were an out-and-out attacking team,” Ure added.“We could defend when we needed to but we used to go at the opposition and test them.“We had a lot of seasoned players like Bobby Cox and Gordon Smith and some really good ones like Alan Gilzean and Alan Cousin. There was a perfect balance to the team.“We wanted to play football – there was no humping it up the pitch and chasing after it.“We were a possession-based team, one of the first in Scotland to keep the ball. It was a European style and that helped us in the European run the next season and why we did so well.“I think that foxed the European teams because they expected the usual Scottish kick and chase so they’d have the ball for 15 minutes at a time – the difference was we were keeping the ball!”That run in Europe saw the Dark Blues hammer Sporting Lisbon and then Anderlecht before falling to AC Milan in the last four.“The Anderlecht game was the best ever. We played at the Heysel Stadium and the whole ground clapped us off at the end, they all rose and clapped.“We were wondering what was happening. We played the stuff you see all great teams play and passed a good side off the park.“They were great days.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2781041b59a-126x180.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc how did it all start for the dark blues","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAt times during their history, Dundee Football Club have proudly boasted of being the city’s oldest professional football club.While celebrations of their 125th birthday this year are confirmation of that, what the Dark Blues can’t claim to be is the first.Indeed, it was the growing popularity of the game late in the 19th century that led to their very existence, through the desire of smaller local outfits to challenge at a national level.The club was in some ways down to the existence of a man about whom little is known. He was Andrew Buttar, president of the Dundee Charity Football Association and, importantly, an official of one of the clubs already on the go in the city – Our Boys.Buttar felt that by joining forces with one of their big local rivals, East End, a new club representing the city as a whole would be capable of doing it proud at national league level.Perhaps surprisingly given the strong tribal nature of football even at that time and the fact an earlier attempt at amalgamation was thrown out by members of the clubs, within a month of him publicly airing the idea they’d met and put together an application for Scottish League membership.So it was that on June 12, 1893, at their AGM, the new Dundee Football and Athletic Club was admitted to the league.In doing so they beat off competition from Cowlairs and, more notably an Edinburgh-based outfit going by the name of Hibernian – whatever happened to them?With just two months to the start of the new season, there was plenty work to be done and, less than two weeks after the league vote, a committee, of which Buttar was vice-president, had been formed to run things.A home for the team had also to be found and, when hopes of playing at Carolina Port were dashed by another local side, Strathmore, obtaining the lease for it, Our Boys’ home at West Craigie Park, a ground that lay roughly between Albert Street and Morgan Street, was earmarked.Work to get it ready for the national league was hastily arranged and carried out. At the same time the committee set about putting together a team capable of competing at a higher level. For the most part that involved picking the best performers from East End and Our Boys, though Scotland cap Sandy Keillor and a team-mate from Montrose, goalie Billy McKie, were also brought in.So it was that, on August 12, barely three months on from the bid to form the club had gained real momentum, Dundee ran out to face Rangers at West Craigie Park on the first day of the new Scottish League season.The Gers were already a well- established league outfit and had secured their first title just two years earlier, so for Dundee to come from two goals down to earn their first league point from a 3-3 draw was a creditable performance.On top of the result, further vindication of the decision to move to the big stage came in the shape of a healthy 5,000 turnout for the game.After a-not-unexpected defeat at eventual champions Celtic the following week, a first win came in the second home game at the end of August when Renton were edged out 3-2.The 18-game campaign would yield a further five wins and two draws for an eighth-place finish and, although that meant they had to apply for re-election, the bid was successful.

All of the tools exist for them to take action now.”Stagecoach has written to local MPs, MSPs and councillors about the impact of congestion and how it is affecting customers every day.The company has also reported a 10% decrease in operating speed leading to an 8% rise in operating costs – with fears it could lead to fewer people using buses.The Transport (Scotland) Bill – which could see the introduction of low emission zones in cities, a ban on pavement parking and improvements to smart ticket schemes – is currently making its way through the Scottish Parliament.Xplore Dundee’s new managing director Christine McGlasson recently told the Tele that congestion was a major issue affecting journey times for city customers.According to research issued by Greener Journeys, the UK Government’s seven-year freeze on fuel duty has resulted in a 4% increase in traffic since 2011.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “Stagecoach is referring mainly to local roads and city centre congestion in this instance, although we do appreciate the frustration that delays can cause on our trunk roads and motorways too. Since 2007, more than £6.5 billion has been invested in the network and that includes major improvements which can bring congestion relief, not only on the trunk road network but to local roads, resulting in benefits for car and bus users.“We are continuing to spend more than £250 million a year to support our vital bus industry, allowing operators to keep fares at affordable levels and provide free bus travel to older and disabled passengers.“We also provide support to local authorities via the block grant so that they can support socially necessary bus services.“We have also doubled our active travel budget from £40m-£80m which will greatly improve public health and ease congestion.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/keepers-collage-300x180.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo delighted as dundee united move to fix up giant goalkeepers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have filled the void in the first line of their defence by fixing up two giant goalies from European football.With Harry Lewis back at Southampton after his year-long loan and Deniz Mehmet out for six months with a knee injury, it was no secret the Tangerines were in the market for goalkeepers.Now they’ve moved for Swiss goalie Benjamin Siegrist and Slovakian keeper Matej Rakovan.

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here and we know what works in this area.\"We just need the right level of support.\"Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \"Things are really moving forward in the area and people

A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon.

It’s your chance to take on the distance of a marathon on your own terms.For many stroke survivors like me, getting your life back means overcoming life-changing disabilities and emotional difficulties. By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"harbour gallery open entry call from tarbert golf club","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 01/06/18, 5:48 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSunday June 3, sees the Stuart Herd Harbour Gallery Open take place at Glenralloch with an entry fee of £15.The club is hopeful that the recent good weather will encourage a healthy turnout of competitors for this popular event.There are four nett prizes and four scratch prizes on offer with the winner receiving one of Stuart\u0026#8217s stunning prints of a scene from Tarbert golf course.To book your entry please call the club at 01880 820565.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process. There will be the option of pre-registration for exhibits the automatic production of labelling for the paintings and photos instant printing of receipts and immediate production of a list of entries to guide visitors.As in past years, people who come to view the exhibition will have free entry, with the option of making a suitable donation to the funds of the society. There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"working to preserve the yarns of yesteryear","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 20/06/18, 7:14 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowPeople across Argyll and Bute are being encouraged to take part in a unique project that will help to preserve tales about the area for future generations.Argyll and Bute Youth Services is calling on people of all ages to help gather stories, film clips, photographs and objects about the area to celebrate the uniqueness of Argyll and Bute.The Digital Storytelling Project is part of the national Year of Young People and aims to bring together our younger and older generations to share their stories and folklore tales of yesteryear.Argyll and Bute Council’s policy lead for education, Councillor Yvonne McNeilly said: \u0026#8216This is not only a great way of capturing precious stories about the area, but it’s an excellent opportunity for a mix of generations to work together.\u0026#8216Argyll is teeming with folklore tales, from giant serpents and mermaids being spotted on our coastlines in years gone by, to stories of haunted caves and bloody battles \u0026#8211 we’ve got a lot to talk about.\u0026#8216The Year of Young People is all about bringing generations together and celebrating our young people.

South Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal. We told last week how the three-year-old policy is being labelled a threat to small businesses. Now councillors are ready to intervene in the row. Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12704340.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/35265670_1680890188694011_7257840954613170176_n.jpg","title":"public hunt dog vanished irvine","story":"NewsPublic hunt for dog that vanished on Irvine beachMaisey\u0027s been missing for almost 24 hours.\u0026nbspShareByRoss Dunn11:04, 14 JUN 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dog owner is urging the public to keep an eye out for her missing pooch.

And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Innerleithen Principals revealed for St Ronan   s Games week 2018","story":"INNERLEITHEN has announced its Principals for this year\u0026rsquos St Ronan\u0026rsquos Border Games and Cleikum Ceremonies.\nHamish Easton, a P7 pupil at St Ronan\u0026rsquos Primary School, was unveiled as the school\u0026rsquos Dux Boy last Friday and will represent Saint Ronan in Innerleithen\u0026rsquos Cleikum Ceremonies during Games Week.\nThe youngster, who lives in the town\u0026rsquos High Street, will have many duties to perform during the celebrations.\nAnd he was delighted to have been chosen.\nHamish said: \u0026ldquoI was very proud and pleased because it is a great opportunity to represent the school and town.\nMeanwhile, Clara Pirie, also in Primary 7, was selected as Dux Girl and will play a leading role in the ceremonies and throughout the week.\nClara, who lives at Kirklands with her family, told us: \u0026ldquoI have always admired the Dux Girls and longed to become one.\n\u0026ldquoWhen Mr Belleville read out my name it was like a dream come true.\nJoining the Duxes as representatives of the school at Games Week this year will be Lantern Bearer Harry Campbell (Primary 2) as well as Monks and Sash Girls from primary three upwards...\nP3 \u0026ndash Sash Girls: Sophie Cotter and Katie Rendle\nMonks: Kian Lynas and Owen Thomas\nP4 \u0026ndash Sash Girls: Elly Baker and Erin Glendinning\nMonks: Angus Henderson and Jack McGinn\nP5 \u0026ndash Sash Girls: Murron Coltman and Carys Leslie\nMonks: Robbie Jackson and Sonny Turner\nP6 \u0026ndash Sash Girls: Sarah Whiteford and Freya Wilson\nMonks: Calum Bauld and James Belleville\nP7 \u0026ndash Sash Girls: Sasha Lamb and Ava Thomson\nMonks: Ally Birks and Billy Birks\nThe announcements were made by headteacher Keith Belleville at a special assembly which was attended by Standard Bearer Elect Jamie Boyd, his Lass Rosie Graham along with their supporters, Principal Guest Craig Glendinning and Games Committee officials, headed by chairman Alan Patterson.\nFollowing the ceremony, every pupil in school was treated to a barbecue and Caldwell\u0026rsquos ice cream.

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

drinks and meat producers have warned of possible shortages caused by a lack of CO2 as the UK enters peak consumption amid World Cup festivities and summer barbecues.\nThe shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe \u0026ndash which is used to carbonate drinks and preserve some packed fresh foods.\nTrade journal Gas World said the shortage had been described as the \u0026ldquoworst supply situation to hit the European carbon dioxide (CO2) business in decades.\nThe UK was hit particularly hard as only one major CO2 plant was operating earlier this week and imports from the continent had been affected by shut-downs in Benelux and France.\nIt said many consumers of CO2, especially carbonated drinks producers, were desperate for supplies of the product, and the shortage appeared to be likely to continue for the remainder of June \u0026ldquoat least.\nBrigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware of a situation affecting the availability of CO2 across Europe, which has now started to impact beer producers in the UK.\n\u0026ldquoWe have recommended our members to continue to liaise with their providers directly where they have concerns over supply.\n\u0026ldquoWe will continue to monitor the situation carefully. However, given the time of year and the World Cup, this situation has arisen at an unfortunate time for the brewing industry.\nThe shortages come as many prepare to celebrate in pubs and at home as they follow England\u0026rsquos progress in the football World Cup in Russia.\nThe shortage could also hit soft drinks (PA)\nRetailers are also expecting sales of alcohol and soft drinks to be boosted by forecasts of a hot summer running through until August.\nTesco\u0026rsquos website is already showing that a number of carbonated drinks, including own-label and Schweppes lemonade and Dr Pepper, is \u0026ldquocurrently unavailable.\nThe British Soft Drinks Association said in a statement: \u0026ldquoThe shortage of CO2 across Northern Europe is impacting a wide range of businesses across the food and drink sector.\n\u0026ldquoSoft drinks producers in the UK are taking active steps to maintain their service to customers including working with their suppliers to mitigate the impact as well as looking at alternative sources.\nThe British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) also said it was \u0026ldquovery concerned about the shortage, as CO2 is used in packing fresh meat and salads.\nBMPA deputy director Fiona Steiger said: \u0026ldquoWe are getting very concerned. It\u0026rsquos different for every member. Anyone who uses CO2 will have individual contracts with suppliers, and each supplier has different amounts.\n\u0026ldquoSupply is running out and it\u0026rsquos pretty tight for some people. Others hope to be able to see it out.\n\u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot know when supplies will be back up. We\u0026rsquove been told it could be about a month.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Josie Clarke, Press Association Consumer Affairs Correspondent\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u0027f5295a2a-88ad-4bd4-b4ec-ec82a9e8f2f6\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:uk\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Beer and fizzy drink shortages possible after CO2 supply disrupted\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.

Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

The group decided to make it an unofficial world record attempt because they were worried they would have to turn away people who were not dancing in time to the music.

The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

The shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe \u0026ndash which is used to carbonate drinks and preserve some packed fresh foods.  Trade journal Gas World said the shortage had been described as the \u0026ldquoworst supply situation to hit the European carbon dioxide (CO2) business in decades.  The UK was hit particularly hard as only one major CO2 plant was operating earlier this week and imports from the continent had been affected by shut-downs in Benelux and France.  It said many consumers of CO2, especially carbonated drinks producers, were desperate for supplies of the product, and the shortage appeared to be likely to continue for the remainder of June \u0026ldquoat least.  Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware of a situation affecting the availability of CO2 across Europe, which has now started to impact beer producers in the UK.  \u0026ldquoWe have recommended our members to continue to liaise with their providers directly where they have concerns over supply.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to monitor the situation carefully. However, given the time of year and the World Cup, this situation has arisen at an unfortunate time for the brewing industry.  The shortages come as many prepare to celebrate in pubs and at home as they follow England\u0026rsquos progress in the football World Cup in Russia.  Retailers are also expecting sales of alcohol and soft drinks to be boosted by forecasts of a hot summer running through until August.  Tesco\u0026rsquos website is already showing that a number of carbonated drinks, including own-label and Schweppes lemonade and Dr Pepper, is \u0026ldquocurrently unavailable.  The British Soft Drinks Association said in a statement: \u0026ldquoThe shortage of CO2 across Northern Europe is impacting a wide range of businesses across the food and drink sector.  \u0026ldquoSoft drinks producers in the UK are taking active steps to maintain their service to customers including working with their suppliers to mitigate the impact as well as looking at alternative sources.  The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) also said it was \u0026ldquovery concerned about the shortage, as CO2 is used in packing fresh meat and salads.  BMPA deputy director Fiona Steiger said: \u0026ldquoWe are getting very concerned. It\u0026rsquos different for every member.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7680660.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Ex Scots TV presenter on trial accused of putting hand down woman s trousers and touching her bottom","story":"              A WOMAN has told a court she has nothing to gain from accusing former TV presenter John Leslie of sexual assault.  The 53-year-old has gone on trial accused of putting his hand down a woman\u0027s trousers and touching her bottom as they danced at her hen night in Atik nightclub in Edinburgh last June.  The woman, who cannot be identified, said she saw Leslie when they entered the club and recognised him from television, particularly Blue Peter.  Leslie is on trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court under his real name John Stott and denies the charge.  The accuser was the first to give evidence and said she had spoken to Leslie during the night about football, some of his ex-girlfriends and speculation he could appear in TV programme Celebrity Big Brother.  While dancing with friends and a stag party later in the night she said Leslie approached her and said \"be careful, you\u0027re getting married\".  She said she thought he was being \"protective\" and suggested they dance together.  Leslie had a hand on her waist and she had a hand on his shoulder, the court heard.  The woman said: \"We\u0027d been going in circles then he pulled me closer.  \"I did feel uncomfortable but thought I was maybe reading too much into it.\"  She said she gave her friend \"a look\" to make her aware she was uncomfortable, adding: \"After that I felt his hand go down my trousers at the back.  \"I didn\u0027t know how to react. I made even more of a look to my friend because I knew I needed to be out of that situation.\"  She said Leslie touched her skin but was not sure if he had put his hand beneath her underwear.  The woman told the court a friend pulled her away and then danced briefly with her hen party to \"pretend it hadn\u0027t happened\".  She added: \"But then I got really upset so moved to the booth.\"  \"I asked my friend something like \u0027why did he think he could do that or what did I do to make him do that?\u0027\"  She went outside with a friend and her sister-in-law who said they should tell someone, the court heard.  She said they told a female bouncer and later a police officer at the nightclub who took her to a station to make a statement.  CCTV of the pair dancing in the busy club was played to the court and the woman said it could not be seen exactly when the alleged incident happened.  Asked by fiscal depute Fiona Nairn how she feels now, the woman said it had impacted on her relationship with her husband, friends and work.  She said: \"It\u0027s been one of the toughest years of my life when it should have been the happiest.\"  Under cross examination by defence lawyer Derek Ogg QC, she cried and said: \"I don\u0027t know why anyone would think I made this up. I have nothing to gain from it.\"  Mr Ogg put it to the woman the CCTV footage showed the dance with Leslie ended \"voluntarily\" rather than with a friend\u0027s intervention.  She said: \"That\u0027s not how I see it. I just wanted out of that situation.\"  It was also established that the woman was taken home by two police officers and given paper bags to place her clothing in with no forensic protocol in place.  Forensic scientist Sandra Coupar-White told the court she examined the woman\u0027s trousers, pants and tutu for potential DNA.  She said a mixed profile was found on the trouser waistband likely made up of touch DNA from the woman, Leslie and two other \"minor contributors\".  She told Ms Nairn that DNA could be passed indirectly from holding hands during by dancing but said direct contact with the inside of the waistband was more likely.  The results from the pants and tutu were inconclusive, Ms Coupar-White said.  Mr Ogg questioned if it was possible for Leslie\u0027s DNA to be passed from one item of clothing to another.  The witness said: \"Secondary transfer is possible.\"  The trial before Sheriff Adrian Cottam continues on Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"Watch the moment famed Glasgow hairdresser is surprised with   137K Porsche prize","story":"              A FAMED Glasgow hairdresser received the surprise of a lifetime after winning a top-of-the-range Porsche worth \u0026pound137,000.

A panel of banking executives told Holyrood\u0027s Economy Committee that pre-consultation with customers was not a factor in the decision-making process.  MSPs have been examining the impact of bank closures in the wake of RBS\u0027 decision to shut at least 52 branches across the country, with a further 10 under review.  SNP MSP Gillian Martin quizzed the panel on whether they held any consultation with customers and communities before taking the decision to shut a branch.  Susan Allen, head of customer interactions at Santander UK, said: \"We don\u0027t do formal consultation with customers before any closures.  \"We fully adhere to the access to banking standards as you would expect. The other thing we do take into account in making our decisions is representations reps from our own local teams.\"  Robin Bulloch, managing director at Lloyds Bank and Bank of Scotland, said: \"We don\u0027t consult formally as has been said already its not a requirement of the standard.  \"I would be concerned with a pre-consultation creating quite a high degree of uncertainty for customers and colleagues about the possible outcome.\"  Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS, said: \"There is no structured customer consultation... but we do look at what our customers actually do, where they bank and how they bank before we take any decision.  \"On the issue of consultation... it is difficult to know where that would start and stop, so there is a practical issue with that.  \"The approach we take to look at what customers are actually doing, how can we best support them and what alternatives are available, is a sound basis.  \"I think the way that we all go about it at the moment is very similar and I think it\u0027s very difficult to see how a consultation reaches a different or better decision.\"  Mr Watson was rebuked by Labour MSP Jackie Baillie for failing to provide information requested by the committee on the number of RBS bank branches now as compared to 2010.  She cited two examples - in Alexandria and Arrochar - where local communities had been left without facilities following an RBS closure.  Ms Baillie said: \"You said that when a bank closes you wanted to leave something behind in the community. What did you leave behind in Alexandria?  \"Given you talk about it wouldn\u0027t be a closure and then nothing, it felt like a closure and then nothing in Arrochar.\"  Mr Watson responded: \"If we\u0027ve fallen short on that occasion then I\u0027m very sorry, I\u0027m very happy to continue the discussion about Alexandria and the specifics.  \"We always try to deliver on our promises and commitments and if we didn\u0027t in that case then I\u0027m very sorry.  \"There\u0027s any number of options we could look at, there are individual circumstances in some communities where it might take us longer to do that but I\u0027m not aware of where there\u0027s been anything where we\u0027ve not been able to provide some kind of suitable alternative and I\u0027m very happy to take up the specific case of Arrochar.\"  He told the committee an independent reviewer had been appointed to review the future of the 10 RBS branches offered a reprieve, with further details to be announced in the coming days."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7809695.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Council withdraws  People Make Glasgow  support for    Trident showcase    arms fair","story":"              THE People Make Glasgow branding has been removed from promotional material for an arms fair in Glasgow, described by protesters as a \u0026ldquoTrident showcase.  There had been concern that Glasgow City Council sanctioned the Undersea Defence Technology 2018 event planned due to open next week at the SEC, which is run by a company that is 91% owned by the local authority.  There is further concern that the council\u0027s arms-length leisure services charity Glasgow Life is adding its support to the event, lending its \u0027People Make Glasgow\u0027 city branding to the promotional material.  But now it has been confirmed that the logo has been removed.    BEFORE (above) and AFTER (below).    The event at the Scottish Event Campus, will see dozens of firms from around the world gather to promote defence and security equipment.  BAE Systems and Babcock International, which are designing and constructing a new fleet of Trident nuclear submarines, are lead sponsors of the fair.  The city council in defending the event say it was held in Glasgow in 2008 and had stressed conferences and exhibitions are worth \u0026pound130 million to the local economy each year.  But now Glasgow City Council has confirmed that the while it has not changed \"practical support\" for the event, it had been decided that the People Make Glasgow log should be removed.  A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoOur conventions team uses the brand \u0026ndash and, in this case, that reflected the practical support they offer to event organisers and venues in the city.    \u0026ldquoAt the same time, the brand is hugely popular and we appreciate that people in the city feel some sense of ownership of it \u0026ndash which is a really positive thing.  \u0026ldquoThere was clearly some confusion about what it represented on this occasion, so we agreed with the organiser that it was better to remove it.  Scottish CND were among groups that had previously confirmed they planned to hold a demonstration during the three-day gathering, which opens on June 26.  And Jay Sutherland of Scotland Against Militarism said the group \u0026ldquowon\u0026rsquot be backing down until full support is removed.  She said: \"The decision to use the logo was completely hypocritical to begin with when most people in Glasgow who are aware of this Arms Fair oppose it.    \"Scotland Against Militarism and the Sink UDT Campaign first pushed for them to remove the branding with our meeting with Susan Aiken, this was not a decision that the council came to themselves.  \"Most of all it shows that people power works and that the council realise they have got it completely wrong, but they are still refusing to remove full support. They recognise that people have claimed the brand but what they don\u0026rsquot realise is that people own the city too and we are not putting up with this.  \"We won\u0026rsquot be backing down until they remove their full support for the event, nothing less. Otherwise they are simply hiding their interests and involvement.\"    Campaign Against the Arms Trade\u0026rsquos Kate Nevens said it is crucial the council put a framework in place for future events.  She said: \u0026ldquoHosting a major arms fair is completely incompatible with a city like Glasgow, which is anti-nuclear and famous for its opposition to war.  UDT, now in its 31st year, has been sold in promotional material as a forum to allow businesses to \"engage with the undersea defence community, network and meet prospective customers, showcase your products and services and reinforce your commitment to this ever-evolving domain\".      The promoters say it provides arms companies with the chance to \"meet face-to-face\" with over 1,400 international, senior military and industry leaders\".  It is organised by Clarion Events, which has hosted family-friendly gatherings such as the Baby Show, the Horse Show and the Spirit of Christmas. Since 2008, it has acquired six arms fairs and joined the arms industry trade body ADS.  In September last year, more than 100 people were arrested at protests outside a controversial Defence and Security Equipment International arms fair which Clarion organised.

But surely the question is ought it to be replicated?  Charles Rennie Mackintosh was a superb architect, a gifted artist, and above all, a dynamic innovator. It is my contention that he would not approve of pastiche or replication.  Mackintosh won the competition for a new art school in 1897, while working as a draughtsman for Honeyman and Keppie, and attending the old art school part-time.

Over the following years, Mackintosh matured as an architect, honed his pared but organic design skills, and completed the second phase, the west wing.  The entire building was testimony to his creative genius and artistry.  Everyone loves Mackintosh now, but he was not always so well regarded in his home city.  It was 15 years before Honeyman and Keppie deigned to make him a partner, and he did not thrive. He left Glasgow with his wife and fellow artist Margaret Macdonald when architectural work dried up.

Somer and Areeb Umeed Bakhsh, who are 15 and 13 respectively, say they are terrified they will be killed because of their Christian beliefs.  The boys - and their parents Maqsood and Parveen - have failed to secure asylum in the UK after fleeing Pakistan six years ago.  The Bakhsh family are now seeking legal aid to appeal immigration decisions to return them to the sub-continent, where British authorities do not believe they are at risk.  Somer, who is studying five Highers at Springburn Academy in Glasgow and hopes to be an astrophysicist when he is older, said: \u0026ldquoI love Scotland and I do not want to go back to Pakistan.  \u0026ldquoThe thought of it terrifies me and it is very stressful to even imagine going back there.  \u0026ldquoI wouldn\u0026rsquot have a future and I can\u0026rsquot even read or write Urdu.  \u0026ldquoI want to live here in Scotland, it is my country and my home.

The family fled to Scotland after the murder of two Christians who were gunned down outside a court, while in police custody, in the Pakistan city of Faisalabad in July 2010.  Mr Bakhsh, an elder at Possilpark Parish Church, claims the people responsible for their deaths believe he is in league with them, know exactly who he is and would kill him and his family if they had the chance.  Paul Sweeney, MP for Glasgow North-East, said it would be \u0026ldquoinhumane to deport two teenagers, who are effectively naturalised Scottish boys.

Many supermarket own-brands have adopted the traffic light scheme, but Which? found that household names such as Kellogg\u0027s are \"lagging behind\" to leave consumers facing a \"bewildering\" range of information about nutrition and portion sizes.  It found that cereals, porridges and granolas can contain more than three-quarters of the recommended daily maximum of free sugars in a portion - with the true sugar level not reflected on the packaging.  Further confusion could result from companies changing the portion sizes on their packaging or, in the case of Nestle, making comparison with other brands difficult by including a measure of milk in the front-of-pack nutritional information.  Of all the cereals and porridges it looked at, Which? found that Kellogg\u0027s Frosties and Kellogg\u0027s Crunchy Nut Cornflakes contained the most sugar per 100g, with a whopping 37g and 35g each - around the same amount of sugar per 100g as Burton\u0027s Wagon Wheels.  Sugar was the second or third highest ingredient in seven out of 10 flaked cereals included in the Which? study.  Nestle Oats \u0026amp More Almond Cereal contained 25g of sugar per 100g - more than two teaspoons of sugar per recommended 40g portion, while the list of ingredients contained six different forms of sugar including sugar, glucose syrup and honey.  Even some apparently healthy cereals were comparatively high in sugar, such as Kellogg\u0027s All-Bran which contained 18g of sugar per 100g - almost two teaspoons of sugar in a 40g serving.  The cereals lowest in sugar were Nestle Shredded Wheat, which contained no added sugar, and Weetabix Original which contained 4.4g sugar per 100g.  Plain porridge was also a healthy choice, with Quaker Oat So Simple and Ready Brek Original Porridge both containing 1g sugar per 100g.  The NHS states that more than 22.5g of total sugars per 100g is high and 5g of total sugars or less per 100g is low.  The consumer group said shoppers would be \"far better served\" if all manufacturers used the traffic light scheme, which shows a high, medium or low level of sugar, salt and fat using red, amber and green traffic light colours based on the amount per 100g.  Under current EU regulations, this form of labelling is only a voluntary requirement, so some manufacturers are not using it.  Which? is calling on the Government to use Brexit as an opportunity to introduce legislation that makes traffic light labelling mandatory as part of an approach aimed at boosting the nation\u0027s health and well-being.  Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: \"It is clear that the current, non-standardised food labelling system is at best confusing and at worst misleading.  \"Helping people to compare at a glance how much sugar, salt and fat a product contains has proven to be an effective way of helping them to make healthier food choices.  \"The Government must not miss this opportunity to use Brexit to make traffic light labelling a legal requirement, so consumers finally have clear information to make better and more informed choices.\"  Izzi Seccombe, chairwoman of the Local Government Association\u0027s Community Wellbeing Board, said: \"The traffic light food labelling system is clear, effective and popular with shoppers.  \"Any post-Brexit review of EU food laws gives the Government the opportunity to introduce legislation to standardise food labelling.  \"At a time when two-thirds of adults and more than a fifth of four- and five-year-olds are obese or overweight, helping people make more informed choices about what they eat will clearly also help tackle the obesity crisis we face as a nation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"The Mack can be restored  says Muriel Gray","story":"              THE Mackintosh building, \u0026ldquothe world\u0026rsquos most indestructible building, can be built again, the chairwoman of the Glasgow School of Art has declared.  Muriel Gray said she believes the world-famous building can be restored from the ashes of the disastrous fire of last weekend.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am massively optimistic that we can.  Speaking after closely inspecting the building with other key staff, Ms Gray said construction firm Kier, which was responsible for the building\u0026rsquos renovation following a previous fire in 2014, had \u0026ldquoquestions to answer from the board.  Experts have estimated that it could cost up to \u0026pound200 million to restore the building after its second major fire in four years.  Ms Gray said she did not know how the blaze began.  The broadcaster and writer said: \u0026ldquoPeople are asking, why are you so quiet? We are waiting to be told the real details, so we can tell the public the real facts. The building wasn\u0026rsquot in our custodianship at the time, it was in Kier\u0026rsquos custodianship.  Ms Gray has called an emergency board meeting, which will meet today, to determine the future of the building.  Insurance was in place for the renovation of the building, she noted firmly, and she said the board had been assured a \u0026ldquogold standard fire regime had been installed at the site.  The building is largely \u0026ldquostructurally solid, initial assessments suggest.  Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said the building was not being written off, with hope that the facade could be salvaged.  Read more: Roger Billcliffe on the lessons of the 2014 fire  Ms Gray, admitted that although she was shocked by the scale of damage the conflagration had wrought on Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos architectural masterpiece, she did not believe it was a \u0026ldquogoner.  New drone footage shows the famous stone walls in place, but devastation within.  Ms Gray said: \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot a goner. It is by no means a goner, it is still there, recognisably standing as the Mack. It is not a few bricks covered in charcoal, it is the Mack, even with its windows burned out, and no roof.  \u0026ldquoSo although it\u0026rsquos a shocking thing to look at, I was actually weirdly heartened by getting to see it.  \u0026ldquoI know it sounds peculiar but it was lot more optimistic than any of us had expected, having seen the flames. It\u0026rsquos like the world\u0026rsquos most indestructible building.  Ms Gray said she believes the building can be saved, but noted: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been a massive, massive blow to everyone involved.  \u0026ldquoBut if we are about to start it again, we know so much more about that building than we have ever known.  \u0026ldquoBy heavens, we are armed to the teeth with knowledge of the construction, the detail of it, it will make it even easier to begin it. I am not remotely pessimistic about it.  Ms Gray said that \u0026ldquothe biggest job next is to keep morale going, to roll up our shirt sleeves, and start again.But the will is there to do it.  As for the cost of reconstructing the building, she said \u0026ldquothat is ineffable at the moment. Questions have been asked about anti-fire measures at the site, but Ms Gray was adamant the board had done \u0026ldquoeverything we could to guard against a second blaze. She said: \u0026ldquoIt was absolutely at the top of our agenda. We were massively fire aware.  \u0026ldquoAnd we were completely re-assured that we had done everything, and appointed the correct contractors to apply absolute gold standard fire protection during the construction of one of the most valuable buildings that we have.  Ms Gray added: \u0026ldquoLast time we would be able to answer every question.We have absolutely no idea what happened this time.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos huge questions to be asked, but they are being asked by us, not only to us."},{"url":null,"title":"Scottish Government urged to look again at role of Confucius Institutes","story":"              SHE was teaching on the other side of the world. But still Sonia Zhao felt the oppressive weight of China\u0027s authoritarian rulers in her classroom.  The 25-year-old was working in Canada for one of hundreds of Confucius Institutes for Chinese language and culture still mushrooming around the globe in recent years. As someone who followed Falun Gong, a controversial spiritual practice persecuted in her homeland, Ms Zhao knew she could be in trouble, even in Ontario. And, so, she feared could her family back in China.  Her story was recently told for the first time in Scotland, the country with the world\u0027s highest concentration of Confucius Institutes, in the Edinburgh screening of an award-winning documentary.  In the Name of Confucius by Chinese-Canadian filmmaker Doris Liu was premiered at the city chambers in the capital amid growing concern - here and abroad - about both academic freedom at Communist-run and funded teaching centres.  Ms Zhao left the now closed Confucius Institute at McMaster University in Canada in 2011 and claimed asylum in 2011. But her\u0027s - thanks to Ms Liu\u0027s film - is one of the few voices of a Confucius Institute (CI) teacher to be heard freely.  Her words echo those of critics of CI from groups like Falun Gong, Tibetans and Taiwan who say they are written out of lessons on China.  Ms Zhao told the film: \"I was instructed to avoid talking about Tibet and Taiwan, If I could not avoid mentioning these, I was to change the topic. If students chased me for an answer, I was told that I must say Tibet and Taiwan belong to China. I think that this violates freedom of speech.\"  Ms Zhao said she had an \"an official script\" to use in classrooms. She also said she had to sign a contract that prohibited her from being a member of Falun Gong. She said: \"It was shocking to see Falung Gong mentioned in the contract. I had been hiding my beliefs for many years. I was really scared.\"  Ms Liu in her film recorded how one major school board, Toronto\u0027s, pulled out of its CI deal. Evidence included textbooks - spotted by Chinese-speaking parents - full of Maoist rhetoric. She also challenged bureaucrats backing other Canadian CIs to say defend the institutes\u0027 \u0027dscriminartory\u0027 employment practices. The film records one Canadian woman behind a CI in British Columbia dismiss her concerns as \"xenophobia\".  But In the Name of Confucius, which was also shown to an audience at the House of Commons last week, also cited Chinese officials behind blunt about the purpose of CIs. Xu Lin, of Hanban, the body which funds CIs and with which the Scottish government and Scottish universities co-operates, was shown on Chinese TV explaining their role. Xu said: \"We send the teachers. We send the textbooks. It\u0027s like the foreign universities work for us. CIs, as many people say, are an important part of our soft power.\"  Scottish authorities, which began working with Hanban under Labour and have continued to do so for a decade, have always claimed that all teaching must reach Scottish standards.  Ms Liu, speaking to the Herald, said tactics for CIs could vary from country to country but that they would always seek influence. She said: \"I am a film-maker, not an activist, but I think the Scottish Government should look seriously at what is happening in other countries and take this matter seriously.\"  American senators of both parties this week again ramped up concern over Chinese actions on campuses across the US, which is currently under an FBI investigation. Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio, a Republican, said CIs had \u0026ldquoconsistently been used as a way to quash academic freedom on campus at the behest of a foreign government\". He added: \"I would encourage every college in America to close them.\" Authorities in New South Wales, Australia, in May announced they would be reviewing their relationship with Hanban. As they made their announcement a new CI opened in Uruguay.  In Ms Lui\u0027s film, a leading Canadian academic set out what he saw as the issue: money. Terry Russell, a China expert at the University of Manitoba, said: \"The fact is most university administrations want to be pragmatic. They see the money. They want to go get it.  \"Until something like the Sonia Zhao case comes up in their backyard, they are not going to do anything about it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Art school  39 s Stow College expansion plans delayed by months","story":"              AMBITIOUS plans to turn Glasgow\u0026rsquos former Stow College into an \"inspirational and truly world class teaching space for fine art students have been delayed by months, it has emerged.

More than 50 holes dug by people undertaking illegal metal detecting have been found at the Brunton Turret section of the 1,900-year-old World Heritage Site, government heritage agency Historic England said.  Nighthawks, the term for illegal metal detectorists, have targeted the turret and well-preserved section of wall, which was built by the men of the Twentieth Legion of the Roman Army, in their search for ancient artefacts.  The ruins of the Brunton Turret section are surrounded by further buried archaeological remains from the frontier of the Roman empire, which are very vulnerable to damage from nighthawks, Historic England said.  The discovery is the latest in a spate of nighthawking incidents along the wall, at Corbridge, Housesteads and Steel Rigg, over the last three years.  All the sites are protected as scheduled monuments where using a metal detector without proper authorisation is a criminal offence.  Historic England is calling on visitors to Hadrian\u0027s Wall and Tyne Valley residents to report illegal metal detecting which is \"causing loss and damage to our shared cultural heritage\".  Mike Collins, Historic England\u0027s inspector of ancient monuments at Hadrian\u0027s Wall, said: \"We know that the majority of the metal-detecting community complies with the laws and regulations regarding discovery and recovery of objects from the land.  \"But the small number of people who steal artefacts and damage ancient sites are breaking the law and robbing us all of the knowledge and understanding that objects from the past can give us.  \"These nighthawks are committing a criminal offence and we\u0027d like everyone\u0027s help to ensure they are caught. Together we can protect the precious shared legacy that our archaeological sites hold.\"  Mark Harrison, head of heritage crime and policing advice for Historic England, said: \"Illegal metal detecting is not a victimless crime.  \"We may never see or fully understand the objects taken or damaged because they have been removed from their original sites with no care or record as to their history or context.\"  He added: \"Historic England will continue to work with Northumbria Police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the metal detecting community to identify the small criminal minority who are intent on causing loss and damage to our shared cultural heritage and to bring them to justice.\""},{"url":null,"title":"  39 Mundell  39 s position is untenable  39   says SNP Westminster leader","story":"              The SNP\u0027s protest at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions \"most certainly isn\u0027t\" a one-off, the party\u0027s Westminster leader has warned.  Ian Blackford said it would \"not be business as usual\" as he signalled the SNP\u0027s \"real determination\" to hold the Government to account over its Brexit legislation.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell\u0027s position is \"untenable\" he added, having \"failed to defend Scotland\u0027s interests\" through the EU (Withdrawal) Bill.  Mr Blackford was ordered out of the Commons chamber following a row with Speaker John Bercow during PMQs last week.  His SNP colleagues then walked out as part of their protest over what they claim is a \"power grab\" over Brexit.  Mr Blackford told the Press Association: \"Is what we did last week, is that a one-off and is that the end of it?  \"It most certainly isn\u0027t and what we do want to signal to the Government in London (is) that this will not be business as usual, our relationship with the Government, which will remain courteous, will be very different and we will seek to hold the Government to account as and when we can.  \"Now of course we\u0027re not going to signal to the Government exactly how and when we will do that, we are looking at a number of things that we can do.  \"This will be procedural, this will be what we can do around legislation, but we\u0027ll do it on the basis that we\u0027re discharging our duty to stand up for Scotland, but it\u0027ll be done in a way which is dignified, which does show respect, we will not show discourtesy.  \"But it will be absolutely crystal clear that there\u0027s a real determination that we have, and if I may say so as well that our colleagues that we work closely with in the Scottish Government have, that Westminster has to understand that we cannot accept what is taking place.\"  The UK Government has previously said the Bill delivers on its pledge to give \"significant further powers\" to the Scottish Parliament, and it would seek consent unless there are \"not normal circumstances applying\" - describing Brexit as such an exception.  The Scottish Parliament has not granted a legislative consent motion for the key Brexit legislation.  Mr Blackford earlier said the Government has to bring forward emergency legislation which respects devolution, the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people.  Asked if the ball was in their court, he said: \"It is, one I think the Government has got to bring forward legislation, two I think they have got to enter into talks through the joint ministerial committee with the Scottish Government but it has to be on that basis that they understand that they\u0027ve crossed the line and this is not acceptable.  \"I think on the basis of where we are at the moment, I do think that David Mundell\u0027s position is untenable.\"  Mr Blackford claimed Brexit Secretary David Davis was \"more appreciative and understanding of the position that we\u0027re taking\", adding: \"I think what the Government in London needs to have is someone that\u0027s a Secretary of State that understands the devolution settlement.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Tweet goes viral as Celtic fans go hoopy for the branding of a New York construction firm","story":"              CELTIC fans have gone hoopy for the branding of a New York construction firm which appears to bear\u0026nbspa resemblance to the club\u0027s badge.

The charity, which is being supported by The Wood Foundation as it expands its reach in the North-east, hopes to eventually be active in every City and Shire secondary school.                                                    The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow. Aberdeen has the second highest proportion of young people failing to move onto \u0026lsquopositive destinations\u0026rsquo when they leave school.        The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos UK Director Ali MacLachlan said: \u0026ldquoNurturing young people at this crossroads in their lives is vitally important in terms of supporting them to find the right path to fulfil their potential.\u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to learn that the North-east has such high rates of young people unable to move onto positive destinations after school. We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing.

As well as keeping the befriendees company, it gets the young befriendees into the voluntary mind-set early on, encourages them to become more empathetic and confident and it shows they can make a difference.Befriendees also benefit from regular contact with people \u0026ldquoso they feel as though they\u0026rsquore part of the community, according to befriending co-ordinator Elspeth Manson.Angie added: \u0026ldquoHelping someone recognise their worth is a benefit for both the befriendee and the volunteer.The recruitment procedure includes volunteers receiving Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance and providing three references. Once accepted, training includes support from other groups such as stroke awareness, Hearing and Sight Care and Parkinson\u0026rsquos awareness.Befriending Caithness is not a standalone organisation \u0026ndash it is helped by the community.An event to look out for is a fashion show at M\u0026ampCo in Thurso on June 28, starting at 7pm. Tickets cost \u0026pound5 and this will go towards the July summer lunch.As well as being greatly appreciated by co-ordinators, the joy felt by the befriendees is evident. Co-ordinator Isobel Campbell shared a few, including \u0026ldquobefriending has saved my life, \u0026ldquohaving a befriender would be a luxury and \u0026ldquobefriending is a cup of kindness.One volunteer remarked: \u0026ldquoI just love a laugh and the banter.Befriending Caithness is looking for a volunteer marketing/social media intern.

When he left the club and took over the national team he asked me to come help with a few bits, and from there I\u0026rsquove been working with the team since November 2017.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not based in Croatia. I only come into the country for the preparations and matches, but when I\u0026rsquom there everyone is very friendly and welcoming.\u0026ldquoThe language is very difficult but luckily most of the team and all the staff speak English. Croatia is a beautiful country and the food is delicious so it\u0026rsquos always a pleasure to go over.\u0026ldquoWhen I\u0026rsquom there you see the culture is a strong passionate people but they are also very considerate and well mannered in general, with everyone happy to help each other out.\u0026ldquoIn my current role I am responsible for the gathering and compiling of our information to share with the coaching staff on the opposition and our own performances and training sessions, then to make that information available through video and written documents.\u0026ldquoWe record all our performances in training through GPS and video and then feed that back each night. Along with this we look to prepare our team through use of video meetings and documents on the opposite team.\u0026ldquoMy role is very much a support role for the coaches where I produce information so they can make the best and most informed decisions.\u0026ldquoThe post-match sessions are used to highlight areas which we can improve and the players are very professional and take this on board and process it into better performances where required next time.\u0026ldquoAs for Croatia\u0026rsquos World Cup campaign, the process began when we saw the draw for the group stages and we\u0026rsquove been building to now since then.Marc says a large chunk of his success has come down to the support of family and friends back home in Caithness.His grannies Nanette Plowman (Wick) and Lilian Campbell (Castletown) both still live in Caithness.Marc added: \u0026ldquoAll of my grandparents and my mum have been very supportive of me throughout my life and have always encouraged me to continue to do better. We speak each week and they always give me a boost in energy through encouragement.\u0026ldquoI always know they are there to support me and my little family and we are forever grateful for their love and support.\u0026ldquoPlus all of my aunts, uncles and cousins have also had an influence in who I am and what I do today.

Few local high street businesses remain in Tain, Mr Stone\u0026rsquos home town.\u0026ldquoThe presence of these empty and increasingly derelict properties undermines one of the most important industries of the Highlands \u0026ndash namely tourism, he says.\u0026ldquoI would therefore suggest that properly tackling this problem should now be one of the most urgent issues for both the UK and Scottish governments.\u0026ldquoThis problem can no longer be ducked by plans that turn out to be more about words than actions \u0026ndash or, worse still, by means of the argument that the decline in the UK\u0026rsquos high street retail sector is inevitable.\u0026ldquoIf we really value our communities and their built heritage, then we must use every means at our disposal \u0026ndash grants, infrastructure investment, tax breaks, local and national planning \u0026ndash so that we can find new ways of bringing these buildings back into sustainable use.Speaking yesterday, Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt pains me greatly to see what is happening, and also to witness nothing better than fine words and hand-wringing when it comes to tackling the problem.\u0026ldquoThis letter is my first move in a campaign that I am going to pursue with the greatest vigour.

All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster. After Hugh retired, Des and the late Mary Somerville took over before handing over to the present incumbent, Duncan Winfield, and wife Gail.One incident in particular has stayed with Murray and harks back to his early days on his rounds. When arriving at the late Annie Bain\u0026rsquos place on the Smerlie road he was implored to catch a ewe that had got loose.Murray jumped the fence and caught it as Annie almost simultaneously thrust her arm up its rear to pull out a new lamb and straight back in for another.After a quick wipe down of the livestock he was then asked if there was anything in the post, almost as if nothing had happened in the previous five minutes. Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.Wednesday 20 Jun 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04110000/04110627.jpg","title":"Wicks Bremner monument gets a facelift","story":"A MONUMENT at Wick in memory of wreck-raiser and civil engineer James Bremner has been given a facelift.\u0026nbspThe Wick Paths Group, which was instrumental in getting the work at the memorial under way, plans to place an interpretive panel at the site telling people about the work Bremner carried out.Group secretary John Bogle said: \u0026ldquoThere are a wealth of stories about James Bremner. I\u0026rsquom sure there are a lot of people who won\u0026rsquot know them.He explained that only the base of the memorial, which was erected in 1903, was still to be refurbished with the interpretation panels set to complete the whole project.The path along by the memorial is on the Wick section of the John O\u0026rsquoGroats Trail, a 147-mile route from Inverness.Mr Bogle pointed out that interpretation panels were already in place on the stretch of the trail through Wick, with one at the Trinkie. However, two existing panels are being moved to the Braehead and North Head.He said the paths were already proving popular with local people and visitors and the group is keen to provide information about the area.Mr Bogle added that the civil engineer\u0026rsquos gravestone \u0026ndash in the graveyard of Wick St Fergus Church \u0026ndash had also been tidied up recently.Wick Harbour Authority chairman Willie Watt MBE said: \u0026ldquoFor me James Bremner is one of the unsung heroes of Caithness. He is just an amazing character. Nothing was too difficult for him and he treated everybody he worked with the greatest of respect. He was a great leader and motivator.Mr Watt pointed out that one of the Wick engineer\u0026rsquos greatest achievements was the refloating of the SS Great Britain \u0026ndash the largest ship of its time \u0026ndash when she ran aground off Ireland in the 1840s.He said that Mr Bremner was sent for from Wick, along with a few of his men, when other engineers had failed in one of the biggest salvage operations of that era.James Bremner (1784-1856) was born at Stain, Keiss. He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.Wednesday 20 Jun 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers.

The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

Feedback gathered will help us as we review route and timetable specifications for the 2020-2025 contract.”Both the ‘Bus Users’ and ‘Non-Bus Users’ surveys are available from the ‘Consultation and Engagement’ section of the council website. The direct link is available here.Paper copies are available on request from the Council’s Transportation Team for those unable to access the online surveys, by emailing transport@orkney.gov.uk or calling tel 01856 873535 ext 2539.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
