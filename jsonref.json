No drinking, no smoking. Homework should be done on time. No mobile phones at the table and regular bedtimes.

I don\u0027t think - partisanship aside - you can\u0027t take away from what he did.\u0027Kennedy went to Martha\u0027s Vineyard to race in the Edgartown Regatta and on the evening of July 18, 1969, attended a party at a rented house on Chappaquiddick Island. Guests included Kennedy friends and several women, including Kopechne, who had worked on the presidential campaign of his brother Robert F. Kennedy, assassinated a year earlier.Kennedy and Kopechne, 28, left the party together and a short time later their car plunged into Poucha Pond. Kennedy escaped from the submerged vehicle and said he made several futile attempts to rescue Kopechne, who was trapped inside.Kennedy, who died in 2009, later described his failure to report the incident to police for 10 hours as \u0027indefensible.\u0027Clarke visited the bridge and pond as part of his research for the film, even jumping in.\u0027It\u0027s pretty much unchanged apart from the bridge itself has got guard rails and wider.

Clarke said the scene was hard to shoot not only because of the ocean\u0027s cold water, but also because he had to get out of the car while upside down.The film, an Entertainment Studios release, spends more time on the aftermath of the accident. Clarke said viewers should leave theaters with a greater understanding of Kennedy.\u0027You can be with Ted a bit. You cannot just externalize it and say bad, horrible, disgusting man. You might want to at the end, but you can be there for it: on the phone afterwards, the walk back, the swim, the lies, the made-up story - or perhaps it\u0027s actually really what did happen. But you can actually stay there with Ted. Not enough to be a Kennedy, but enough to almost touch him,\u0027 he said.Jim Gaffigan, who plays attorney Paul Markham, one of the co-hosts of the party that Kennedy and Kopechne left together, agreed.\u0027We all have earlier versions of ourselves that we\u0027re not crazy about. At least I do,\u0027 he said. \u0027So there is something very interesting about the journey that Ted goes through, and being exposed to his relationship with his father.

This issue should be a ‘priority’ for the Government’s current review of post-18 education and funding, he added.The number of students enrolling with the OU has slumped from 242,000 in 201112 to 173,927 in 201617 – a fall of 28 per cent.By some estimates, the OU has lost 600,000 students who might have been expected to start studying in that period if the funding had not changed.Most of the drop was in England, which is affected by the Government’s fee changes.The OU has traditionally been the ‘University of the Second Chance’, helping people often later in life and while holding down a job.Almost 80 per cent of OU students work full or part-time during their studies, and the institution has helped more than 2 million people since it was founded in 1969.Instagram blocks drug hashtags after FDA calls out social...Share this articleBut in 2012, the Coalition Government withdrew teaching grants to universities across England and allowed fees to triple from £3,225 to £9,000 a year.It was believed this would encourage the take-up of higher education due to the creation of a ‘market’ in fees.But it had the opposite effect on part-time students, who are often older and more likely to be deterred by debt.Despite losing tens of millions of pounds of state funding, the OU said it tried to keep its fees ‘as low as possible for as long as possible’, but it has had to increase them significantly. An OU degree now typically costs students about £18,000 over six years, compared to more than £27,000 over three years at conventional universities.Lord Willetts admitted that mature students were being put off by the fee and loans system that he oversaw as a minister.Asked whether there should be a Government subsidy for the OU, he said: ‘My view is that, yes, we should bring back some level of public funding for mature students because whereas the fees and loans have worked for the people coming from schools straight into university, it’s not working so well for mature students and we need to promote more adult learning.’Mr Halfon, the chairman of the Commons education select committee, said the OU was ‘probably one of the most important education institutions in our country’ because it provided a ‘ladder of opportunity’ to millions.He added: ‘To me, the OU should be the kind of model of higher education we should be supporting in a big way – far from cutting funds we should not only subsidise it but actually be doing everything possible to back it financially and politically.’He said the OU should be regarded as an ‘elite’ university and receive ‘significant amounts of support from the Government because of the work that it does’.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute think-tank and former special adviser to Lord Willetts, said he thought the OU had ‘priced themselves higher than they needed’ in 2012 and should have charged ‘slightly lower’ tuition fees.          Five years ago, Ryan Peddie was working as an IT manager in a Newcastle civil engineering firm, but feeling jittery about his career prospectsHe says: ‘It was a huge decision to go back to studying. I had to fund my degree myself and, with my family responsibilities, it could have been a catastrophe. But I knew that even if a degree didn’t help me out in this job, it would be useful to have on my CV.‘So I took the gamble. It was one of the best things I ever did.’ His ‘incredibly supportive’ partner Caroline had their fifth child, Rowan, just over a year ago, when Ryan was trying to get his degree finished.He jokes: ‘I think the baby cost me my first-class degree. I had been wanting a First, but with the sleepless nights and a newborn in the equation, I suppose I can’t beat myself up too much about my 2:1!’As well as his degree, his employer turned the corner and profits are well up.Ryan is not only still in a job, but in a much more senior job — finance director.On his watch, the company’s fortunes have shifted to the point where they now have a £7 million turnover.The increased responsibility has led to him doubling his salary. ‘That’s a nice bonus,’ he admits.

The terrorists claimed to have destroyed four Syrian military aircraft. In February this year,  Israel\u0027s Air Force launched an attack on the airbase, destroying the main observation tower, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.In came after, Israel accused Iranian forces at the T-4 base of sending a drone into Israeli territory. Israel has previously accused Damascus of allowing Iran to set up a complex at the base to supply arms to its ally, Lebanon\u0027s Shi\u0027ite Hezbollah. The base was used by the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s for the occasional deployment of naval aircraft.

Another activist, Bilal Abou Salah, said a large, yellow cylinder smashed through the roof of an apartment building and came to rest on the third floor and started to discharge gas.The Syrian Civil Defense group documented 42 fatalities but was impeded from searching further by strong odors that gave rescuers difficulties breathing, said Siraj Mahmoud, a spokesman for the group.A joint statement by the civil defense group and the medical society said that more than 500 people, mostly women and children, were brought to medical centers complaining of difficulty breathing, foaming at the mouth and burning sensations in the eyes.

The OPCW has destroyed 100 percent of all the country\u0027s declared toxic stockpiles, but Uzumcu has repeatedly said there were gaps in the declaration by the Syrian regime.The convention bans the use, development, production and stockpiling of all chemical weapons.          Dozens were killed and others left gasping for air in the alleged attack in the eastern suburbs of Damascus on SaturdayBut amid \u0027persistent allegations\u0027 of their use in Syria, the OPCW set up its own independent fact-finding mission in 2014. It has investigated more than 70 cases of alleged toxic gas attacks in Syria since 2014.In 2015 the OPCW joined with the UN to form a joint investigative panel, known as the JIM, tasked with identifying those behind the chemical attacks in Syria.In October, the panel released a damning report that found the Syrian air force had dropped sarin on the rebel-held village of Khan Sheikhun in April 2017, killing scores of people.Yet another recent OPCW report concluded that sarin was used in another incident on March 30 in the village of Latamneh.The Syrian regime has also been blamed for using chlorine gas on three villages in 2014 and 2015. The Islamic State jihadist group was found to have unleashed mustard gas.Russia used its veto power twice in November to block the renewal of the panel, maintaining it was biased and unprofessional.Meanwhile, the European Union is squarely laying the blame for the latest suspected poison gas attack with Syrian President Bashar Assad\u0027s government.EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said that over the weekend and early Monday as the reports came in of another atrocity in Syria, the EU \u0027learned from several sources\u0027 to shape its conviction \u0027that it is the Syrian regime which is responsible\u0027 when it comes to the suspected chemical attack.

Controversy has stalked Reed since his university days when he was accused of cheating and stealing (pictured in 2006, two years before he joined Georgia University)An arrest for underage drinking and possession of a fake ID eventually saw him ousted from Georgia . He admitted leaving after \u0027a couple of drinking-related incidents.\u0027Notoriety followed him, however, and within weeks at Augusta he had been suspended for an unspecified \u0027violation of team rules.\u0027Reed was again accused of cheating by declaring lower scores than he had actually shot, and was reportedly so unpopular with teammates that they wanted him out.It was during this time that he met Justine, a nurse who would become his caddy when he turned pro in 2011 and then his wife when the pair married in 2012. It was Reed\u0027s relationship with Justine that is reported to have driven a wedge between him and parents Bill and Jeannette, who reside in Augusta but were not invited to attend this Masters - nor any other major tournament in which Reed has competed.While Reed has not publicly spoken about the split, Golf magazine wrote that Reed cut ties with his parents after they suggested he was too young to marry Justine.Bill and Jeannette did make it to one of Reed\u0027s tournaments, the 2014 US Open, using spare tickets given to them by a friend - but were soon escorted out by security, allegedly at Justine\u0027s request.      Justine is pictured with Reed after winning the Cadillac Championship in 2014, shortly before she gave birth to their daughter, Wilson-Wells          Reed is pictured alongside wife Justine and daughter Wilson-Wells as the announce a new addition to the family. Son Barrett Benjamin was born in December 2017          Reed\u0027s parents reportedly did not attending his wedding to Justine in 2012, and in 2016 their feud exploded into the public eye when she accused them of abusing him as a childShe stayed by his side as a caddy until 2014, when the birth of daughter Windsor-Wells saw her retire to the sidelines. Her brother, Kessler Karain, has served as Reed\u0027s caddy since.The same year saw Reed in hot water for using a homophobic slur while ranting to himself during an event in Shanghai.After shooting a bogey on the first hole, television microphones picked up Reed saying \u0027nice f****** three-putt, you f****** f****t\u0027, for which he later apologized.Later the same year Reed drew the ire of European golf fans during the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, shushing the crowd after sinking a putt on the seventh hole. Then, in 2016, the family feud exploded into public view as Justine penned an angry Facebook post, accusing his parents of physically and mentally abusing him.She wrote: \u0027His parents verbally and physically abused him for most of his life, abused alcohol and would get in fist fights with him in parking lots after bad rounds.\u0027Patrick was seen as a \u0027meal ticket\u0027. Not my words, his. This is no sob story, we don\u0027t have time for that. This is the truth.\u0027That was followed up by another post from Reed\u0027s sister, Hannah, who vehemently denied the allegations.\u0027There was never, ever any abuse mentally or physically, abuse of alcohol, or fist fights in the parking lot because he had a bad round,\u0027 she said.            Bill and Jeannette have been publicly supportive of Reed\u0027s career, but were reportedly escorted from the crowd of the 2014 US Open at Justine\u0027s request  This photo of Reed as a baby was posted by his mother Jeannette on Facebook in August 2017          Reed grew up in Texas and became obsessed with golf from a very young age          Reed, in this picture posted by his mum in June 2014, has not spoken to his parents since 2012\u0027The fact that Patrick is allowing his new family to say that is insane. It is devastating seeing my parents hurt and suffer from what is being posted about them.\u0027Hannah also branded Reed \u0027a selfish, horrible stranger\u0027 and said he was \u0027not a brother any more\u0027.The 2016 Ryder Cup saw a revival of shush-gate, as McIlroy and Reed faced off and used increasingly over-the-top taunts to wind each other up.Justine then gave birth to their son Barrett Benjamin in December 2017, though it is reported that his parents have little contact with the family.Speaking after his Masters win on Sunday, for which his parents were not present, Reed was asked whether celebrating the win without them was bittersweet.\u0027I\u0027m just out here to play golf and try to win golf tournaments,\u0027 he said.   In 2014 Reed drew the ire of European golf fans as he taunted the crowd, and allegedly needed a police escort in order to leave the course          Asked whether winning The Masters without his parents present was bittersweet, Reed replied: \u0027I\u0027m just out here to play golf and try to win golf tournaments\u0027Who is Patrick Reed?

Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter, 33, pictured, are recovering well in hospitalMr Skripal, who had previously been given just a one per cent chance of survival by his family, is now in a stable condition – while Yulia is recovering so fast she could soon be discharged.MI6 officials and the CIA are said to have discussed giving them a secret life in the US.Mr Skripal has British citizenship, but his Russian daughter could be given political asylum by Britain in the meantime. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who was left in a serious condition after rushing to the aid of the Skripals after they collapsed and was also treated by the same medical team, was released from hospital last month.The Skripals are also understood to be providing police and the Security Services with vital information that could lead to the culprits being identified.The account provided by security sources challenges claims from Moscow that its nerve agent could not have been used in the Salisbury attacks because it is too toxic for anyone to survive exposure to it.Meanwhile Boris Johnson accused Jeremy Corbyn of being ‘the Kremlin’s useful idiot’ last night for refusing to blame Russia for the nerve agent attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal.The Foreign Secretary claimed the Labour leader was playing ‘Putin’s game’ by refusing to say ‘unequivocally... that the Russian state was responsible’.He said: ‘There is only one thing that gives the Kremlin succour and lends false credibility to its propaganda onslaught.          Mr Skripal\u0027s niece Viktoria, pictured, has been denied a visa by the UK to visit her relatives\u0027That is when politicians from the targeted countries join in. Sadly, I am driven to the conclusion that Jeremy Corbyn has joined this effort.’ The Russian embassy has accused the Foreign Office of failing to explain why a relative of the Skripals was denied a visa to visit them.Government sources told the Mail that the visa was refused over fears that Miss Skripal’s cousin Viktoria was being used as a pawn by the Kremlin.Miss Skripal has also said she does not want Viktoria to visit her, and has rejected demands from the Russian embassy that it provide consular support to her and her father.But some Russian relatives of the poisoning victims claim they are being held ‘in detention’ in Britain. Sergei Skripal Russian message intercepted on day of poisonings | World | News | Express.co.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"Siblings Day need know","story":"When does Bachelorette 2018 Start: All you need to knowWho is Nicolle \u0027Nicole Leach\u0027 Rochelle?

According to Mr Cooper\u0027s log book, he was involved in the second Black Buck attack which involved refueling his Vulcan bomber seven times before dropping 21, 1,000lb high-explosive bombs on the island\u0027s airstrip in a mission which took 15 hours and 45 minutes          Among the items going under auction is this plan from a Vulcan bomber          Mr Cooper, pictured right with squadron commander John Laycock received a South Atlantic medal for his role in the 1982 Falklands WarThe fascinating archive has emerged for auction and is tipped to sell for £7,000.Steven Parkinson, auctioneer at Thomson Roddick, of Carlisle, Cumbria, said: \u0027Mike was one of the people who played an integral part in ending the conflict sooner, saving lives in the process.\u0027They were the best of the best and what the bomb navigators did required incredible skill.\u0027This collection ticks so many boxes.\u0027There is a massive following for the Vulcan, perhaps second only to the Spitfire.\u0027There is a lot of intrigue in the Falklands War and it is the 100th anniversary of the RAF.\u0027This sale is a rare opportunity to acquire an extensive and unique personal collection.\u0027          Mr Cooper\u0027s flying suit is also going under the hammer during Wednesday\u0027s auctionFlt Lt Cooper, from Welton, Cumbria, joined the RAF in 1964 and qualified as an air navigator in 1966.He was one of the best in his field and won bomb aiming competitions on both sides of the Atlantic.He joined 50 Squadron and after Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands his was one of just three crews selected for the Black Buck missions.After only 15 days training, they were deployed to Ascension Island on April 29, 1982.The following day, Flt Lt Cooper\u0027s crew took off for the first raid but they had to abort the 7,600mile round trip because of a cabin pressuration failure.However, four days later, they successfully completed \u0027Black Buck\u0027 Two, with Flt Lt Cooper aiming a bomb which left a 50ft crater at the end of the the runway.Argentine plans to extend the runway were scuppered and they were forced to keep launching attacks from their mainland 950 miles away.This meant they could only spend 15 minutes over the Falkland Islands because of fuel constraints.After the war ended, the jet-powered Vulcan, which had provided 26 years of distinguished service, was taken out of action and replaced by the new Tornado combat jet.Most Vulcans were scrapped and the few survivors are all grounded today.Looking back on the missions, Flt Lt Cooper said he wasn\u0027t \u0027apprehensive\u0027 about putting his life in danger because he had a job to do.          Among the items for sale is Mr Cooper\u0027s log book which contains details of the missionHe said: \u0027The crew was summoned to the Squadron Commander\u0027s office and he said straight away how do you feel about seeing action in the South Atlantic.\u0027To a man we said we were happy to give it a go.\u0027I wasn\u0027t apprehensive because we had a job to do and we knew we could do it.\u0027Up until three days before the missions we were practicing dropping bombs at low level to get below Argentine radar but since these would skip along the runway it was decided that we should bomb from a higher altitude instead, another challenge for us.          Mr Cooper said he was selling his medals and his Vulcan archive so he would be able to take his grandchildren on holiday \u0027I aimed the bombs and these weren\u0027t laser-guided like today\u0027s technology, we relied on a radar system which was in the late Second World War Lancasters.\u0027It was so important we succeeded because if the Argentinians could have extended the runway for their fast jets to launch attacks from our ships in the South Atlantic would have been decimated.\u0027I remember dropping the bomb and it landed 30ft from the western end of the runway, leaving a 50ft crater.\u0027When we retook the island I was told it was an almighty job trying to repair the land so we could land our own jets there!\u0027When we came back to the UK there was no song and dance but over the years what we achieved has taken on a new dimension.\u0027 Mr Cooper explained that he has decided to sell his medals and Vulcan archive so he can treat his grandchildren to a holiday.He said he doesn’t feel sad about parting with the mementos as he will always have his memories of his career. The auction takes place on Wednesday.           Mr Cooper participated in a bombing and navigation competition in Florida in 1971          There are  anumber of photographs among the memorabilia which will be sold at auction          Mr Cooper said he is not concerned about selling his archive as he has his memories           The Vulcan bomber was designed in the 1950s to deliver a nuclear bomb to Russia           Ahead of the Falklands War, the RAF had begun the process of decommissioning the Vulcan          This is the navigation bag used by Mr Cooper on the mission to attack Port Stanley\u0027s runway          Mr Cooper said one of his bombs left a 50-foot crater on the runway "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/09/15/4AF9E68E00000578-5594621-image-m-12_1523283513813.jpg","title":"Sir Nick Clegg says new political party highly likely","story":"    Simon Franks, pictured at the 2005 Venice Film Festival with George Clooney and film producer  Shebnem Askin, is said to have been working on a new \u0027centrist\u0027 political party for a year  Nick Clegg, who lost his seat in 2017 but is still campaigning to stop Brexit, has not ruled out joining a new party and urged fellow liberals to put aside tribal links to their partiesA tip for the chap spending £50million on a new centre...Secret plans for a new political party have been drawn up...Share this articleHe said: \u0027I am relatively un-tribal. But I personally have always felt that liberal values are more important than which particular vehicle is carrying them at any particular time.\u0027 \u0027I think other people - whether it\u0027s liberals or liberal Conservatives should always be open to doing what they think is right and consistent with their values rather than being high bound by whatever political tribe they are in.\u0027          Simon Franks is said to be frustrated with political ision in light of the Brexit vote and the lurch left of the Labour partySir Nick denied claims he is being lined up as a possible leader.    Other  mooted as a figurehead have included David Miliband.His brother Ed is close to Mr Franks, who acted as his business adviser when he was Labour leader. Simon Franks was not at home today to discuss plans for a new centrist political party. He is yet to give any interviews and has not used social media to discuss the plans. At their £3.8million mansion in Hampstead, north London, his wife Carolyn refused to talk about her husband\u0027s new venture.She said: \u0027Simon is not here, I know nothing about it and I am not prepared to comment sorry.\u0027 Mr Franks and his wife live in a huge property behind black gates. The mansion is set back from the road by a long driveway.The former banker, who worked for JP Morgan and Paribas, quit and set up the Redbus film distribution business in his bedroom.In 2005 he sold the company, which distributed Bend it Like Beckham, to US distributor Lions Gate for £19.9million.He also helped set up a DVD rental company called Video Island, which would later become LoveFilm. This would then be sold on to Amazon for £200million before being shut down last year.Describing his journey Mr Franks said previously: \u0027I got a job in banking which was fascinating and terrible and I saw lots of great people get trapped in the system of just being addicted to the money.\u0027When David Bowie ran out of money and securitised his music rights I thought wow what a great idea, I\u0027m going to do that for film rights\u0027.          Mr Franks was not at his North London home today and is yet to speak out about the \u0027centrist\u0027 party claims in the ObserverUp to £50million has been pumped into the project with a former Labour benefactor at the helm hoping to \u0027break the Westminster mould\u0027.He has had full-time staff on the project for about year after starting initial discussion in 2016. His company - Project One Movement for the UK - is said to be a probable vehicle for the scheme.But there is reportedly consensus that candidates will run in the 2022 General Election if the movement decides the current system is defunct. The identities of those involved remain secret, other than Franks, but a source said they are ready to challenge \u0027our current crop or professional politicians\u0027.  But another person familiar with the scheme said: \u0027They have the resources, but I\u0027m not sure they have a viable plan.\u0027Others named online as possible backers include Richard Reed, founder of Innocent Smoothies.Mr Reed, who was one of three Cambridge University graduates who founded Innocent at the age of 26 in 1999 before selling it to Coca-Cola for £320million, donated to the Lib Dems in 2015. He is also a friend of Nick Clegg\u0027s.  The movement is aiming to take back the centre ground as Jeremy Corbyn, pictured, takes the party in a left-wing direction and Theresa May, right, leads the Tory government           David Owen (pictured) and the Social Democratic Party of the 1980s took just 23 seats despite winning 2.8million votes in the 1983 General Election Politicians who have made successful centrist snatches include French president Emmanuel Macron, whose En Marche! movement delivered a majority in the national assembly last year.Critics of Franks\u0027 project point to the Social Democratic Party of the 1980s, when four senior Labour politicians formed a liberal alliance that took only 23 seats despite netting 7.8million votes in 1983\u0027s General Election. However the plans for a centrist challenger party were dismissed by the shadow chancellor and two of his frontbench colleagues.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell tweeted: \u0027That\u0027s a novel idea. A party of the rich, by the rich, for the rich. A party for the few not the many.\u0027Shadow health and social care secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \u0027For goodness sake, what a daft waste of time. Anyone putting money into this nonsense would be better off investing in our campaign to restore and rebuild our NHS.\u0027Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, tweeted: \u0027A new political party with £50m in the kitty, no members, no rule book, no ideology.

Now he’s coming to Britain, what surprises can we expect?Christo is standing in the driving rain patiently surveying the site for his latest artwork, which will rise a whopping 20 metres from the currently choppy waters of the Serpentine lake. His white locks and quilted Issey Miyake coat are flapping about madly as the downpour sweeps through Hyde Park, but the 82-year-old artist looks happy enough.From our vantage point on the bridge over the lake, we can just about make out dogs romping round the Princess Diana memorial fountain. From June, I learn, this popular landmark will be overshadowed by Christo’s first large British artwork: a giant stack of 55-gallon barrels, numbering 7,506 in all, floating on the lake. The artist, born Christo Vladimirov Javacheff in Bulgaria, is best known for having wrapped the entire Reichstag in Berlin in a vast silvery curtain, but he did a similar thing to the Pont Neuf in Paris, too. He also stretched a pier across an Italian lake that made visitors feel they were walking on water. Then there was the erection of 7,503 gates hung with saffron-coloured fabric in New York’s Central Park. And now he’s going to float a 150-tonne sculpture on a lake on London. Is it an allegory of the west’s oil dependency, an indictment of how we’re polluting the planet, or both? Christo shakes his locks and smiles. “I have no reason to justify myself as an artist. I cannot explain my art. Everything I do professionally is irrational and useless.” This, he thinks, is exactly as it should be. “I make things that have no function – except maybe to make pleasure.”What he will supply in London is some easy-to-access irrational uselessness. “There will be no tickets,” he says, “no reservations and no owners. It will belong to everyone until it’s gone. It will be a landmark for a few months.” He and his wife Jeanne-Claude, with whom he collaborated for 35 years until her death in 2009, often worked with barrels because of their sculptural effect and low cost. One early work was a barricade across the Rue Visconti on Paris’s Left Bank. Critics were quick to seize on it as a topical response to the iron curtain, as well as a nod to Paris’s revolutionary tradition, though Christo declines such reductive interpretations. “What I remember is Jeanne-Claude doing a lot of explaining to the police to allow it to stay in place for a few hours. She was very forceful.”This new barrel sculpture will be called the Mastaba. The what? “The mastaba is a very ancient form,” Christo explains as he and his entourage chat to me over coffee in the nearby Serpentine Gallery. “It originated in Mesopotamia at the time humans moved from agricultural societies to urban ones. It became common as the shape of benches outside the first urban Mesopotamian homes. Later it became associated with pharaohs’ tombs.” It’s a trapezoidal prism, I understand, though not quite pyramidal? “That’s right. The walls are always 60 degrees from the horizontal.”As well as being 20 metres tall, the Mastaba will be 30 metres wide and 40 metres long. The barrels visible on the top and the two slanted walls will be painted red and white while the ends of the barrels visible on the two vertical walls will be painted red, blue and purple.All very interesting, but can I still swim in the Serpentine? “Of course! In fact, that may well be the best place to see my sculpture from.” Assurances have already been given to the swimming club that the Mastaba won’t interfere with their dips. One can understand their worries: the sculpture will rest on a floating platform made of high-density polyethylene cubes anchored to the lakebed. Plus there’s its frame, made of steel beams. How could that not interfere with their bracing morning swims? “We will leave the Serpentine better than it was before,” promises Vladimir, who is used to dealing with doubters. “We negotiated for nearly a quarter of a century before we got the OK to wrap the Reichstag in 1995. Christo got death threats from the neo-fascists and from the ex-communists too.” They aren’t the only ones who have failed to appreciate Christo’s work. For many years, he and Jeanne-Claude planned a project called Over the River. This would involve suspending 10km of reflective, translucent panels over the Arkansas river on steel cables anchored to its banks. These would be so high that rafters could still navigate the river while savouring the sculpture (although looking up while you’re rafting does, to my mind, sound quite dangerous).Christo spent $6m testing fabrics, conducting environmental studies and negotiating with the authorities, despite some rafters comparing the project to “hanging pornography in a church”. Roar, a protest group whose initials stand for Rags Over Arkansas River, launched a lawsuit. “It was to be the biggest, maybe the most amazing work of art ever,” says a defiant Christo but, at the start of last year, he cancelled Over the River in protest at Donald Trump’s election. Why? “I don’t want to talk about that today,” he says. Last year, however, he told the New York Times: “The decision speaks for itself.” Except, really, it doesn’t. “My decision process,” he added, “was that, like many others, I never believed that Trump would be elected.” The looming Mastaba will not be the first work Christo has created in London. In 1963, he wrapped a journalist who’d turned up to do an interview (for the rest of our conversation, I eye Christo narrowly in case he tries to pull a similar stunt). One day, he and Jeanne-Claude visited the studio of photographer and socialite Anthony Haden-Guest. “I wanted to wrap a naked woman,” says Christo, “and Anthony helped me. She turned up to do an interview, not knowing what we wanted, not knowing she would be naked. Then that famous celebrity hairdresser arrived – you know the one?” Vidal Sassoon? “Yes, Sassoon. He did her hair, she took her clothes off and I wrapped her up. There is a lovely film of it that Anthony made. She was called Ruth – I can’t remember her surname.”So Ruth became the precursor of all these wrap works. If you are Ruth and want to tell your side of this story, please get in touch. Happily for Ruth, her translucent mummification didn’t last: in an age of incessant commodification and creating for posterity, Christo and Jeanne-Claude always produced temporary works. “Artists – and above all architects – seek permanence,” he says. “I don’t. I like leaving nothing. That takes courage.” It also takes something else: a disregard for his bank balance. “There’s nothing for collectors to buy,” he says, “nothing for them to collect.” Sometimes all that remains of Christo’s art is the documentary evidence of his trusty photographer Wolfgang Volz. And yet CVJ, Christo’s company, is flush with cash, which is all the more surprising because he never accepts commissions or sponsorship. Why? “I came from a communist country. Ever since I escaped through the woods from Czechoslovakia to Vienna in 1957, I have been free. I like to be totally free to do the things I want.” CVJ has long backed projects by selling preparatory drawings and collages in advance. “Do you know that there is now a course at Harvard Business School that uses three examples – Jobs, Gates and Christo – of how to succeed in business? I am a very successful capitalist.” And so was Jeanne-Claude: the pair have been hailed as virtuosos of the art business deal. “We have always been good at negotiating. And we needed to be, otherwise these projects would never have been realised. But we have always been very good at getting banks to supply lines of credit.”Christo studied art in Sofia and Prague before deciding, after the Soviet crushing of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, to go west. “I have never been back since. I have no desire to. Ever since 1973, I have been a citizen of America. That is my home.” Then he checks himself: “Not really a citizen of America. Jeanne-Claude used to say, ‘We are citizens of Manhattan, not America.’”He took a long time getting there though. After setting up in Vienna, he headed to Paris. “I washed cars and dishes to survive. Then I started painting portraits. I signed them Javacheff – which distinguishes the work I did for money from the work I do to be free.” One portrait commission was of Jeanne-Claude de Guillebon, daughter of a French general whose mother had been a resistance fighter in the war. He fell in love with her. “The painting is now in the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego.” In 1963, though, it became a work by Christo, not Javacheff, when he wrapped it in polyethylene and rope, thereby creating a new work.Wrapping became a feature of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s art, a technique that, according to critics, is all about aesthetic revelation through concealment. The pair’s little apartment on a Seine islet was filled with wrapped brown paper parcels, bottles and paint cans, as was their originally illegal loft space in Manhattan that became their studio from 1964 onwards.“She was born the same day as me: 13 June 1935.” I’ve read that Jeanne-Claude became an artist, she said, out of love for you and that, had you been a dentist, she would have become a dentist too. “All true. She dyed her hair red because I suggested it.” The couple collaborated so closely that they always took separate flights, so that if one died in a crash, the other could live on to continue their work. Despite this, for decades Christo got all the credit, a situation they tried to reverse in 1994 by retroactively crediting their creations to “Christo and Jeanne-Claude”. She died of a brain aneurysm and now he lives on to continue their work.Is the London Mastaba a joint project? “It is. The mastaba form is something we worked on for years.” At the Serpentine Gallery throughout the summer, there will be a show of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s drawings and collages, including those for their long-nurtured plan for an even bigger mastaba 100 miles outside Abu Dhabi. For this mastaba, which would comprise 410,000 barrels and be permanent, the couple negotiated with sheikhs and enlisted the help of French foreign ministers and former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright. So far it hasn’t got the go-ahead, but that doesn’t seem to stop Christo talking about it optimistically.“It will be 150 metres high,” he says. By my reckoning, that would make it 11 metres taller than the Great Pyramid at Giza. “We have worked out that the footprint of the mastaba will be the size of the Vatican Square in Rome. Nothing in the world has ever been built like that.” He pauses. “It will be like the Eiffel Tower in the desert.”• Christo and Jeanne-Claude is at the Serpentine, London, from 19 June. The London Mastaba will be completed by June.

According to a Deloitte survey of chief financial officers (CFOs) at some of the UK’s biggest businesses, companies are now less pessimistic about Brexit after ministers agreed the terms of a transition period with Brussels to smooth Britain’s exit from the EU.The UK and European\u0026nbsp​​commission have agreed on a text that completes the first stage of Brexit negotiations, focusing on three areas: the rights of EU and UK nationals in each other\u0027s territories​, the financial settlement the UK will pay,​​ and arrangements for the Irish border. Assuming this is approved\u0026nbsp​by the European council, talks can move on to the\u0026nbsp​second phase, including future trade.Not really. The big decisions on Northern Ireland have largely been kicked down the road. For example, if future arrangements cannot avoid a hard border, the UK will “maintain full alignment with internal market rules – the specifics remain vague.Where does ​this leave the Brexiters?The EU\u0027s agreement to move on with the talks means Brexit now seems inevitable, barring a major surprise. Brexiters are likely to be less pleased that May has been forced to agree to more or less all the EU’s demands, ​including a bill of ​about £40bn.Where does this leave the Democratic Unionist party?Watching and waiting. May somehow got its approval for the deal ​– perhaps by stressing that it would otherwise be blamed for halting Brexit. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said the new text remained worrying in areas such as the possible need for regulatory alignment.Reflecting the views of 106 companies, including almost a quarter of the FTSE 100, the survey found a fifth of business leaders were more optimistic about their firm’s prospects than they were three months ago. On a scale of 0 to 100 for the risks facing their business, the CFOs assigned a rating of 56 for Brexit versus 57 for weak demand as a result of sluggish growth in the economy.Deloitte said this was the first time since the spring of 2016 – before the EU referendum – that Brexit had fallen behind any other potential risk facing businesses, although admitted that some of the weakness seen in the economy will have come as a result of the vote to leave the EU.David Sproul, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte for north west Europe, said: “Weak UK demand is cited as the top concern, though there is likely to be a relationship between the two. Brexit remains a major concern for UK CFOs, though one which, in the wake of the announcement of the transition deal, is easing.”The sudden drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote pushed up the cost of importing food and fuel to Britain, triggering a spike in inflation and eroding the spending power of consumers. Several companies, including Toys R Us and Maplin have gone into administration as a consequence. The economy has recovered in recent months, with signals that the inflationary effects of the weak pound are beginning to fade, while workers’ pay is gradually starting to rise. But there are still significant pressures for the economy, including weak productivity growth and potential labour shortages. Still, the results of the Deloitte study follow a similar assessment from the Bank of England’s network of regional agents, who found two-fifths of the more than 3,000 firms that they surveyed had not spent any time at all on a weekly basis planning for Brexit. The accountancy firm EY also found there was little impact from the vote on international firms investment decisions in the UK so far.However, there is a danger that businesses could become complacent following the agreement over the transition period, which pushes out the date at which Britain leaves the EU until December 2020.Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: “Although the transition arrangement is done, they have yet to settle the border in Northern Ireland and the future trading relationship. Were that not to happen that would be a big problem and would have a significant effect on business confidence.”There are already warning signs for the road ahead. According to EY, around half of the foreign companies currently in the UK could consider moving assets out of the country at some point after 2020, depending on the outcome of the ultimate Brexit deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79bd64c2e5f28bd2fcc42585e9a7499eb14e7985/0_374_5217_3131/master/5217.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=244838e590a1e2e6fd2297afba61538a 2600w","title":"the struggle for melbourne has the worlds most liveable city lost its way","story":"Plonking an Apple store in Melbourne’s biggest civic square has caused a long-simmering debate about the future of Australia’s most progressive city to boil overIn Melbourne’s Federation Square, people are sitting on the steps, eating lunch among the pigeons under a sky that threatens drizzle. The cascading crazy paving and interlocking sandstone facades supposedly, in the architects’ vision at least, represent the desert heart of Australia. Across the road, a banner hangs from the walls of St Paul’s Cathedral: “Let’s fully welcome refugees.” Melissa, an academic, walks out of the Koorie Heritage Trust, housed in the Yarra building on the square’s south side. It is due to be demolished to make room for a “flagship” Apple store, under plans announced by the state government a few months ago out of the blue and without public consultation.The proposal for the jarring two-storey pagoda, dubbed “the Pizza Hut” by critics, was met with a fury that is hard to over-estimate. Petitions were started. Public debates were held.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.Melissa is “very, very upset” about Apple intruding in this public place. “This is a nice spot for people to be.”When Federation Square opened in 2002, it was a shock: uneven surfaces, all angles and scant greenery. Oh so modern, and so out of place alongside the elegant, establishment Melbourne of the 1910 Flinders Street railway station and St Paul’s Cathedral across the road.But like everything about Melbourne – a bar you stumble upon, your favourite barista, exuberant street art in tiny laneways – Fed Square grows on you. Film star and Melburnian Chris Hemsworth has said it is a “mellower Times Square, where all paths seem to lead”.It attracts 10 million visitors a year, two million more than the Sydney Opera House. Locals and tourists have embraced it as a place to both protest and celebrate. It is a civic place: an old-fashioned term that somehow captures something indefinable about the city.It was here that more than 150,000 people protested the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the biggest anti-war gathering in the country since the Vietnam war. We come together to share events on the big screen – World Cup soccer, the Australian Tennis grand slam, and especially Australian Rules Football, the free-flowing game we follow obsessively. We take free dancing lessons and meet friends, or swarm to catch a glimpse of Oprah.If Melbourne is going through a wobbly moment – and it surely is – you can sense it here. For a city weighed down by its gong as the “world’s most liveable city” for seven years straight, it’s uneasy about where it’s going, uncertain whether it wants to be a global megacity doubling its population to eight million by midcentury, or hang on to its charms. The city has been through many booms and busts since its European foundation in 1835 but, as urban historian Graeme Davison puts it, one of the threads through its history has been a quaint sense of civic values an idea of a shared purpose beyond commerce and getting ahead.Davison is the author of The Rise and Fall of Marvellous Melbourne, chronicling the heady days after the Gold Rush in the 1850s. This was a time when Melbourne swaggered – it was reputedly the richest city in the world and the fastest growing. Davison says the city has always been a pragmatic, commercial place – it was settled by land speculators, after all – but from its earliest days Melbourne had a strong streak of public benevolence. A site for the city’s glorious English-style botanic gardens was picked barely a decade after it was founded. A few years on, its early leaders thought to establish what would become the National Gallery of Victoria, the first major art gallery in the country.“On the whole Melbourne has been that kind of city, but I sense a danger to it now,” says Davison.There are many strands to that danger: astonishing population growth – the fastest of any capital in the country – and rising inequality, epitomised by housing prices beyond the reach of ordinary wage earners (houses have a median price tag of more than $AU 900,000 – though Melbourne remains cheaper than Sydney, which tops $1m).It has become a two-tiered city, with cosmopolitan Melburnians living near transport and cultural facilities, and the neglected fringe dwellers sitting in traffic for hours to get to work. Then there is the fury over Federation Square, and the idea that the public’s sense of ownership of it may be lost.Davison was so dismayed about the Apple announcement he wrote an article for The Conversation website. “It would not occur to the average Briton to ask whether Trafalgar Square is paying for itself, much less to install an Apple store beside Nelson’s Column,” he wrote. “Isn’t it time we grew up and recognised that not everything that is important to our collective life has a price? That commercial values do not trump civic ideals?”It was a “plea from the heart” to recognise that the idea of “civic good” is threaded through Melbourne’s history and is central to the city’s character, says Davison.Unlike New South Wales (NSW), Queensland and Tasmania, the state of Victoria was never a penal colony and Melbourne was never a convict town. The Gold Rush made it a boomtown: optimistic, modern, and seductive to so many people dreaming of gold that its population soared from 29,000 to 169,000 in a decade. Then in the 1890s came the crash and the depression a slump in wealth and confidence from which it only gradually recovered. Melbourne’s leaders were often different to those in other places in Australia, says Davison: progressive, looking to the long-term. This was the city of Alfred Deakin, a progressive liberal crucial to Australian federation, and later prime minister of H B Higgins, the judge who brought down the famous Harvester decision, which guaranteed wages high enough for “a human being in a civilised community”.“All those people articulated common values in Melbourne,” says Davison. “Melbourne had a character that tended to draw people to the middle politically.”For much of last century, Melbourne was the most establishment of places, known as the jewel of the Australian conservative party’s crown. It was censorious. Pubs shut at six, because that was good for all of us, leading to the famous “six o’clock swill”, where boozers would down as many as they could before closing time. It was – and remains – the private school capital of Australia.But a few decades ago, Melbourne threw off its staid image. Mass immigration after the second world war shook it up, and clever planning brought the central business district to life. The Postcode 3000 campaign that began in the 1990s is considered an international lesson in how to revitalise city centres that hollow out after the work day ends. About 150,000 people now live in central Melbourne, and high-rise apartments house people, as well as offices. More people brought more nightlife and cafes, and old laneways – once a dumping ground for trash – were transformed into hidden gems.Along the way Melbourne has become the most politically progressive city in Australia. If it were up to Melburnians, Australia would already be a republic and have negotiated a treaty with Indigenous Australians.Even Melbourne’s conservatives tend to be small “l” liberals at heart. The radio shock-jocks of Sydney are disdained by Melburnians, who would rather debate than shout.The city was transformed in large part by the astonishing influx of immigrants after the second world war – many from the UK, but tens of thousands from Italy and Greece, as well as displaced East European Jews. Then in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Vietnamese immigrants came.Melbourne is in now in another people boom, with around 120,000 new residents settling in the city each year, and record immigration from China and India.Population growth is the conversation Melburnians are having – or want to have, if political parties would engage. The political editor of the Age newspaper, Josh Gordon, articulated the unease last year when he wrote that the pace was unsustainable: “It’s time to accept that Melbourne has, over the past decade, lost much of its coveted liveability and no longer deserves the title.” Melbourne is headed towards a population of five million and is predicted to overtake Sydney as Australia’s most populous metropolis by the 2030s. Its growth is dizzying, and the city is groaning with it.The state government is trying hard now to provide the infrastructure needed. Cars crawl through city streets dug up for the biggest public transport project Victoria has ever undertaken: the $11bn Metro underground railway project that will add stations and ease bottlenecks. The problem is that it won’t open until 2025, by which time the city will have added another million people.High demand for housing is one reason prices are out of reach for many. “If we keep going with city rents and prices the way we are, we’ll end up in a city where only the very rich will be able to live,” says Independent mayoral candidate Sally Warhaft. “The people who make the city tick will be forced further and further away.”Davison says he worries about the pervading political message that there is no alternative to rapid growth. “There is a legitimate argument about how big the city can be, and how big is should be. Just to take it for granted that this is irresistible is a mistake.”We meet for lunch in Box Hill, a suburb about 20km east of the city centre that is a designated “activity centre” – which means it is slated for growth. Once a conservative, white middle class house-and-garden suburb, it remains one of the few quaint spots in Melbourne that is “dry”. There are no pubs or clubs, and restaurants cannot serve alcohol – although that is slowly and quietly changing.Davison has no problem with areas being earmarked for fast growth, but fears that what is being lost is Melbourne’s character: its sense of connectedness, of civic good. More prosaically, Melbourne is one of the lowest-density cities in the world – a great sprawling place. Davison says that it might seem an outdated, 20th-century notion now, but putting space between people made city living less irritating and more comfortable.”People move here because it gives them a chance to own a house – you can buy a three-bedroom place for $450,000. Among the incomers are thousands of immigrants, especially from India. Ninety babies are born a week – its mayor, Peter Maynard, knows the statistics by heart. Wyndham is a terrific place to live, he says – “people say g’day in the street” – but it has its strains. For the first time, the council has put up temporary, demountable buildings to house kindergarten children because demand is too high to wait for permanent structures.“We’ve got about 26 kindergartens now, and we still need another 26 in the next 17 years,” says Maynard. “We need 20 primary schools and five secondary schools. Build us five primary schools yesterday and we’d fill them already.”One of Wyndham’s claims to fame is that it has the highest proportion of people in the country spending two or more hours a day in traffic travelling to and from work. #nightmarecommute was the hashtag used to document the area’s transport woes on the inaugural western suburbs’ “National Nightmare Commute Day” last year. Across Melbourne there is angst about infrastructure, and governments are scrambling to catch up. Even with all the road and public transport work going on, it is estimated that half of all car trips in peak hour will be congested in two decades, up from a third now. There are murmurings in Australia’s most successful multicultural city that perhaps immigration should slow for a while to allow everyone to take a breath for a few more schools to be built, for public transport to improve, for housing costs to settle a little. Former New South Wales premier Bob Carr has called Australia’s rate of population growth – far higher than in comparable countries – a “weird experiment”. Sydney is also struggling to cope, but nowhere is that struggle so obvious as it is in Melbourne. Does Melbourne want to be a city of eight million people? If so, will it lose its connectedness, its civic values, of common purpose? Does it have a choice?Davison’s phrase “Marvellous Melbourne” has often been cited with pride, but just as often with irony. How marvellous that young people can barely afford a house. How marvellous that people living in outer suburbs spend weeks of their lives stationary in traffic. How marvellous that homelessness is on the rise.The “world’s most liveable city” is used ironically too, at least among many locals. The Economist Intelligence Unit has declared Melbourne to be so for seven years, a record, taking into account safety, health care, education, infrastructure and the environment.The Economist’s index is a corporate thing – a guide for companies sending their executive staff overseas. Politicians boast about it. “This world record is an amazing feat that all Melburnians should be extremely proud of today,” the-then mayor said last year, but those here roll their eyes. Travelling corporate executives will not live in Melbourne’s outer suburbs, or struggle to afford the rent, or spend weeks of their lives stuck on freeways.It’s telling that the Economist notes that cities that score best tend to be mid-sized, in wealthy countries with low population density. The city that came second last year was Vienna, with 1.8 million people, then Vancouver with 2.5 million. “These can foster a range of recreational activities without leading to high crime levels or overburdened infrastructure,” the Economist says.Any bigger and people pay the price in crime, strained transport and inequality. Perhaps they lose touch with each other, too.Back at Federation Square, it’s worth visiting the gallery of Australian art. It contains one of the most famous paintings of Melbourne: John Brack’s Collins St, 5pm. It’s Melbourne in the 1950s, and portrays dull workers leaving their offices and heading home to the suburbs. Every person faces the same way, their countenances drawn and unsmiling, a picture of dreary conformity.Melbourne is nothing like that now. It’s lively and feisty, comfortable with its ersity and confident in its creativity. It’s just that it’s changing – again – very fast. It might turn out to be marvellous, of course. Or what makes it special might may swept away, without us noticing until it’s too late.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

Reinstating the Irish border would be an enormous setbackTwenty years ago, the Good FridayBelfast agreement helped bring an end to decades of conflict and violence in Northern Ireland. It was a watershed moment – the result of diplomatic efforts within the halls of government and extraordinary actions of ordinary women and men who reached across longstanding and bitter ides.Today, the agreement stands not only as a local framework for shared understanding, but as a shining example of what’s possible when citizens come together to demand peace, and preserve it across generations. As the world celebrates this significant anniversary, we must also remain vigilant in protecting the agreement in the face of our current challenges – from the uncertainties heralded by Brexit to the hurdles posed by the impasse in devolved government in Northern Ireland – and do all we can to deliver on the unrealised aspirations of human rights and equality that were espoused that day in April 1998.Even now, I can picture clearly my husband’s first trip to Northern Ireland as president. On a cold winter night in 1995, Bill and I joined thousands of people at Belfast city hall for the lighting of the Christmas tree. As Catholics and Protestants alike came to that spot from their deeply ided neighbourhoods, there was no guarantee that violence wouldn’t break out yet they came with a sense of hope, after so many seasons of darkness.It was on that same trip that I first met some of the women whose names are too often forgotten, despite their vital role in the agreement. One of those women was Joyce McCartan, a Catholic mother whose 17-year-old son had been shot dead by a Protestant gunman. Joyce invited me to join women from both traditions at the safe house she had set up in a local fish and chip shop. We sat around a small table, drinking tea out of an old aluminium teapot, while the women told me how they had first reached across their ides to band together to stop the price of their children’s milk from going up. Along the way, they discovered that the deep-rooted causes of the violence – the terrors of sectarianism, the burdens of poverty, the despair of unemployment – touched all of their lives. In the end, for them and for so many women across Northern Ireland, love of family ran deeper than calls to hatred.Though they may not have made the headlines or the history books, those kitchen-table conversations were essential to the peace process. So were all the women who came together to form a coalition and claim a formal seat at the table – women like Avila Kilmurray, Monica McWilliams, Pearl Sagar, May Blood and so many more who moved mountains to help negotiate the Good Friday agreement years ago at Stormont.There are some who argue that the agreement has outlived its usefulness. They are wrong. Countless people in Northern Ireland are alive today, rather than in early graves, because of it. The last thing we can afford to do is become complacent, or delude ourselves into thinking our work is finished. In fact, 20 years later, crucial components of the agreement still have yet to be implemented. An integrated education system and support for community development, the promotion of the representation of women, and a bill of rights for Northern Ireland are all promises that have yet to be realised. The fact that the Civic Forum has fallen by the wayside is especially tragic, since it would offer a venue to discuss many of the urgent issues facing Northern Ireland today, including the possible outcomes of Brexit negotiations.These are difficult times for Northern Ireland, and for our world. As the Brexit debate rages on, I continue to believe in the value of the European Union, and of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace. But no matter the outcome of these discussions, we cannot allow Brexit to undermine the peace that people voted, fought and even died for. Reinstating the border would be an enormous setback, returning to the “bad old days” when communities would once again be set apart.Two decades ago, it was acknowledged that just as the Troubles didn’t start overnight, peace was never going to come overnight. Now, as the world celebrates this significant anniversary, the principles the agreement represented in the first place are more important than ever: a commitment to peace, prosperity and healing as the people of Northern Ireland build a shared future. As Avila and Monica recently wrote, if short-term interests take precedence over solving the long-term challenges that still exist in Northern Ireland, “then it is clear that the hand of history will be both heavy and unforgiving”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d1de64def104912af3a34cd0af48a0050b4ebb/0_256_832_499/master/832.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=42c5a6578b0a2f1a40f861718407603a 1400w","title":"west bromwich albion safe standing area rejected by government","story":"West Bromwich Albion’s request to introduce a safe-standing section at the Hawthorns has been rejected by the government.The club, who are bottom of the Premier League and 10 points adrift of safety with five games to play, had hoped to install 3,600 rail seats in the ground’s Smethwick End and have described the decision as “disappointing” and “short-sighted”.The application was made to the Sports Grounds Safety Authority, the government agency set up to regulate sports stadia after the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, and it referred the proposal to the department of digital, culture, media and sport.The SGSA said the club’s request was rejected by the sports minister, Tracey Crouch. “West Bromwich Albion is subject to the government’s all-seater policy and DCMS have said they have no current plans to change their position and introduce standing accommodation at grounds in the top two isions covered by the all-seater policy,” it said.A DCMS spokesperson confirmed they had “no plans” to change their policy but said they “will continue to monitor the issue of spectator accommodation and the use of safe standing where it is permitted”.Widely used in Germany and successfully piloted at Celtic, rail seats can be flipped up and locked in place to provide a safe space to stand, while still assigning each fan a designated spot in the stadium. Clubs in English football’s top two tiers have, however, been forced by law to be all-seat ever since Lord Justice Taylor’s report into the tragedy at Hillsborough which left 96 Liverpool fans dead.The anger, grief and shock caused by Hillsborough meant any debate about the rights and wrongs of standing to watch football was a non-starter for years but that has changed in the last decade. This is a result of large numbers of fans making it clear they want the choice and many safety experts pointing out that standing itself is not dangerous but standing in seated areas is. It was this last point that prompted West Brom’s director of operations, Mark Miles, to make the application.“I find the decision from the minister of sport both surprising and disappointing,” Miles said. “It will be disappointing for many supporters I have spoken to who were in favour of what we were proposing. We have written back requesting a review.”  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52db5866ab2f86ec203cf4e6833f3e3a3349320c/448_127_4841_2905/master/4841.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=be5dad632d9c5dcf9eea75b2d40ecb6a 1240w","title":"manchester merseyside serve derbies of contrast football weekly","story":"Guest host Nat Coombs and the panel discuss a marvellous Manchester derby, Ayoze Pérez’s strike, Wayne Rooney’s strop, red cards galore in Ireland and managers who sound like drinksRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

There are three that I make on rotation at home. One: a banana buttermilk loaf from my friend and soon-to-be royal-wedding-cake-maker, Claire Ptak. And then there are these two: a dense, gooey (and incidentally vegan) chocolate cakemade with coconut oil (as much of a hit with my two year old as it is my vegan brother) and a loaf cake peppered with flecks of rosemary and chunks of chocolate and which uses olive oil instead of butter. The rosemary and chocolate are an unexpectedly subtle pairing, which I adore. This is a less sweet cake, almost fudgy, dotted with chunks of chocolate with a delicate herbal back-note. It’s so good that, if I got married again, I’d have it as a layer in my wedding cake.This is such an easy cake to make: no creaming, no sifting. Be sure to use a tight-fitting cake tin as the batter is quite wet and will run out if there are any gaps.For the cake225g plain or light spelt flour1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda1 good pinch salt75g cocoa250g dark muscovado sugar75g coconut oil1½ tsp vinegar (I use cider)Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Grease an 18cm round springform cake tin with oil and line the base with baking parchment.Put all of the icing ingredients except the chopped chocolate into a heavy-based saucepan with 60ml cold water. Heat until the coconut oil is melted, making sure the mixture doesn’t boil, then turn off the heat, add the chocolate and leave it to sit. After about a minute, whisk until you have a dark glossy icing and set aside. It should be cool and thick by the time the cake has baked and cooled.For the cake, whisk the flour, bicarbonate of soda, salt and cocoa together in a bowl. Make sure there are no lumps of bicarbonate of soda.In a separate bowl, mix the sugar, 375ml of just-boiled water, the coconut oil and vinegar. When the coconut oil has melted, stir into the dry ingredients, then pour into the prepared tin.Bake for 35-40 minutes. When it is ready, the cake should come away from the edges of the tin and a skewer inserted into the centre will come out clean. Cool for 30 minutes in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Pour over the icing and decorate as you wish – I have used a few flowers here, but chopped nuts and grated chocolate are also favourites.You can use a standard olive oil here it doesn’t need to be extra virgin. It pairs wonderfully with rosemary, but I have also made this by nestling a few bay leaves in the top of the batter instead. You could also replace the rosemary with orange zest or the seeds from a vanilla pod.Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Oil and line a 1kg loaf tin. Put the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into a large bowl and use a whisk to mix together, making sure there are no lumps of baking powder.In another large bowl, whisk the eggs, then add the olive oil, milk and rosemary and mix. Now fold the olive oil mixture into the dry ingredients, gently mixing until just combined, but no more: for a light cake, don’t overmix.Stir in most of the chocolate, saving a little for the top. Pour the mixture into the tin and smooth the top. Scatter the rest of the chocolate on top, pushing the pieces down into the mixture a little so they are half covered, then scatter over the demerara sugar for a crunchy top.Bake for about 40 minutes, or until it is golden brown and a skewer comes out clean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6d94b82c43dcb8b9ef74e75b9d17df94d9600fa/0_160_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9b73bbba1bddcdbc774f2a49f6673939 1240w","title":"seven ways to improve your sleep","story":"Key restorative processes take place while we are asleep, yet about one in five adults in the UK, and a third of those in the US, fail to get the seven to nine hours recommended for those aged 18-64. Sleep deprivation has been linked to a long list of health problems, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression and obesity. Sleep tracking tech can help you work out if you are failing to give your body time to recover at night. Devices and apps that monitor only movement are less accurate than those that also track heart rate and breathing patterns.It is not, however, all about duration. Our bodies do different things during different sleep phases, which are characterised by different brainwave patterns. REM sleep has been linked to learning and memory, while growth hormone is released during deep sleep. One of the best ways to boost sleep quality is to maintain regular sleep times. A US study published last year found that students with irregular sleep patterns get lower academic grades.What did Albert Einstein, Margaret Thatcher and Salvador Dalí have in common? They were all enthusiastic nappers. Sleeping for 10-20 minutes after lunch can be restorative, although longer naps, especially in the late afternoon or evening, can undermine night-time sleep.Many believe a nightcap improves sleep. A 2013 review of 27 previous studies showed alcohol can indeed help people fall asleep more quickly, but also that it reduces REM sleep. That helps explain why you may feel drowsy and lack focus the morning after. Booze also disturbs sleep by increasing urine production, making you need the bathroom at night. Caffeine, meanwhile, blocks the build up of sleep-inducing chemicals in the brain. Research suggests leaving at least six hours between your last coffee and bedtime, although the time it takes to break down down varies from person to person.Body clocks in almost every cell in the human body use signals about light levels to control fluctuations in things such as hormone levels, temperature and metabolism. Studies have shown that melatonin is released earlier and sleep duration is longer in societies that live without electric light. Candlelight may not be practical, but dimming bright lights in the run up to bedtime helps your body prepare for sleep. Using tablets, phones and televisions late at night does the opposite.Research has shown that working out can boost sleep. A review of 34 studies involving almost 2,000 participants found exercise shortens the time it takes to nod off and improves sleep duration and quality. However, Japanese researchers found that vigorous running an hour before bedtime cuts sleep length, while moderate exercise does not. “Regular exercise during the day or evening is a great way to improve sleep, but within two hours of bedtime it releases hormones that can lengthen the time needed to get to sleep,” says Shadab Rahman, a sleep researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.Ensure your mattress and pillows are comfortable and supportive. If you are sharing, you are likely to sleep better in a 1.8 metre-wide super king than a 1.4 metre-wide double. Thick curtains or blackout blinds can also help. Body temperature drops during sleep, so 16-18C is about right. Keep your bedroom clean and clutter-free. Soothing scents may put you in the right mood for a good night’s sleep."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3555c38d7d4e4e6ad69b6697be34fb057bffbf87/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1fdf20548dc8b74dd137428b2dc8deb7 1240w","title":"uk march house prices post biggest monthly increase for six months","story":"House prices strengthened in March to post their biggest monthly gain since August, according to surprise figures from the UK’s biggest mortgage lender.The figures were an unexpected boost for the housing market after months of lacklustre growth and declines in December and January reported by Halifax, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group. The role of the London housing market in the growth increase was not clear, because Halifax will not release a regional breakdown of the data until later this week. Experts warned against predicting a prolonged revival in price growth based on the Halifax figures. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The jump in Halifax’s measure of house prices in March just looks like volatility, rather than the start of a strong upward trend. Halifax’s index is prone to large swings.” Russell Galley, Halifax’s managing director, said: “Activity levels, like house price growth, have softened compared with a year ago. Mortgage approvals are down compared to 12 months ago, whilst home sales have remained flat in the early months of the year. This lack of direction in the housing market is in stark contrast to the continuing strength of the UK jobs market.”Jeremy Leaf, an estate agent in north London and housing spokesman at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, echoed Galley’s comments. “The increase in property prices is more to do with a shortage of stock, low mortgage approvals, and subdued activity rather than any great change in the market,” he said.“What the results do show is that those who are actually looking to buy at this time of year are obliged to pay higher prices for properties in the areas they want to live in order to get what they want, which is what we are also finding on the ground.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dab00cc7019a6967cfeed7360660440b36dae6b/0_133_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=95d1ceb7b84226cf857b3d4111ed8b46 1240w","title":"lindsey buckingham fleetwood mac tour","story":"The longstanding member will be replaced by the Tom Petty guitarist Mike Campbell and Crowded House’s Neil FinnLindsey Buckingham has parted ways with Fleetwood Mac months before they are scheduled to embark on a live tour.In a statement, the band announced: “Lindsey Buckingham will not be performing with the band on this tour.

We explain why it’s a burning issueWhy does it matter what medicines cost?If you are lucky enough to live in a country with comprehensive state-funded healthcare, such as the UK, you probably have no idea how much medicines really cost. But it can be a lot. Some drugs that have been around for ages are very cheap – aspirin, for instance, costs pence. It’s been out of patent and made by numerous companies competing to undercut each other’s price for decades. But new medicines, protected by 20-year patents, can cost hundreds of pounds a packet and sometimes thousands. The new breast cancer drug Kadcyla weighed in at a starting price of £90,000 per patient per year in the UK in 2015, though the manufacturer has now agreed a hefty discount for the NHS.Isn’t that really just a problem for poor countries?No. The new drugs that cure the liver disease hepatitis C were launched at a price that elicited squeals of pain from the UK, western Europe and the United States, as well as India and Romania, which both have high numbers of infections. In the US, the drug sofosbuvir (brand name Sovaldi), launched at a cost of $1,000 a pill. In the UK, the manufacturer Gilead was asking £35,000 for a 12-week course, with some patients needing 24 weeks. It was soon clear that no country was going to be able to treat everybody who needed them, even though hepatitis C is a killer in the long term and the drugs are – unusually – a cure.In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which decides whether drugs are value for money, said yes to hepatitis C drugs, provided Gilead gave a discount. The drugs would save years of expensive NHS treatment, including liver transplants. But the government balked at the cost of treating everybody – an estimated 160,000 people are infected. Normally the deal is that the NHS must introduce any drug Nice approves, but in this case it chose to phase it in, treating the sickest first and making others wait, which was unprecedented.In the US, the cost was out of the question for many people without good health insurance cover. The prices of new cancer drugs have also been prohibitive.Didn’t drug prices crop up in the US election?Yes. The cost of drugs became a hot political potato. Hillary Clinton promised to bring down high prices, and Donald Trump also gave the subject a mention. The row wasn’t triggered by hepatitis C, though, or even cancer, but by a scandal concerning the hiked prices of old drugs that caused a huge public outcry in summer 2015 and made Martin Shkreli, then chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals (he has had to resign since), the “most hated man in America”. That’s quite an accolade. So medical drugs are not like Chryslers or Porsches in the public mind, then? It would seem not. The anger was clear evidence that people think medicines are a special case and that people have a moral right to affordable treatment. There is quite a tension between that view and the pursuit by pharmaceutical companies of profit for shareholders in the free market.So how much does it cost to make a medicine?Ah – that’s the $64bn question. Well, no, it doesn’t cost $64bn to create a drug, but there is a great deal of heated debate about the real cost. The biggest issue is what you factor in. The big pharma companies say you have to calculate not only the (usually cheap) cost of the raw ingredients and manufacturing, but also the cost of research and development of the drug – and also the R\u0026ampD costs of all the drugs that fail to get to market. Clinical trials to test new drugs for safety and find out how well they work cost millions of dollars, and many drugs look good in the lab or in animals but don’t work in humans – or there are serious side effects. Research pharma companies need to set those costs for failures against the profits from the drugs that work – it’s the only way they can afford to keep looking for new medicines, they say.The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston, Massachusetts, which produces estimates for the cost of making a medicine every few years, accepts that argument. Drug development is a long process, taking as long as 10 years, it says. It’s expensive. The centre’s latest figure for the cost of developing a prescription drug that gets marketing approval, published in the Journal of Health Economics in March 2016, is a colossal $2.558bn. The analysis, Tufts says, was based at least in part on information from 10 pharma companies on 106 randomly selected drugs that were first tested in human subjects anywhere in the world from 1995 to 2007.Does anybody contest that figure of $2.6bn per drug?Yes. There are now a lot of campaigners calling for greater access to medicines in both rich and low-income countries. They are not impressed with the argument that pharma should cost in its failures. And furthermore, they say that often the best drugs were invented in university labs, paid for from public funds, so that should also be taken into account. In these cases, they say, the pharma companies buy up promising potential drugs and do the large-scale testing and development.But if pharma companies insist they have to charge high prices because of their high costs, what can be done?That’s been much debated in recent years. The first big access-to-medicines movement was sparked by Aids in Africa. The inequity of thousands dying for lack of drugs while people with HIV in San Francisco were alive and well on medication became a huge issue. Campaigners succeeded in enlisting the Indian generic company Cipla to make super-cheap versions of the HIV triple-drug combinations in 2001 that cost $100 a person a year instead of $10,000.Why didn’t the rules on patents stop that?Patents normally apply for about 20 years but have to be registered in each country where the drug is sold. That stops other companies making rival copies that might compete to push the prices down. But India had different intellectual property rules at the time, which meant the HIV drugs patents did not apply there. So India’s generics companies became the pharmacy for the developing world. But the rules have since changed and attempts to make cheap copies of new drugs such as the hepatitis C medicines in India have been subject to long battles in court.At least health services can save money by using cheap copies once drug patents run out.Yes. The good news for hard-pressed health services everywhere is that it is now possible to make cheap copies of “biologics” as well. These are much harder to copy, because they contain living cells or blood or proteins, not just simple chemicals. Many cancer drugs are biologics and for some time many doctors had doubts that the so-called biosimilars would work as well as the originals. But now it is clear they do. And the Royal Marsden cancer hospital in London says one year’s use of the first cancer biosimilar, a version of rituximab to treat lymphomas, has saved the NHS £80m. They estimate the health service could save £200m to £300m a year – maybe more – by embracing the biosimilars coming along, which include a version of the breast cancer drug trastuzumab, better known as Herceptin.But campaigners say patients with cancers and other life-threatening diseases who don’t have loads of money cannot just wait for the patents to run out.Is it just radical campaigning groups that are trying to get the prices of the patented medicines down?No. Médecins Sans Frontières, winner of a Nobel prize, has played a big part through its access campaign, which started in 1999, proclaiming “medicines shouldn’t be a luxury”, but the issue has also more recently been taken up in the United Nations. It’s about the cost of drugs that the entire world needs, including new antibiotics the pharma companies have stopped trying to invent because they can’t make a profit on them. The World Health Organization is strong on access to medicines for all and also has a list of essential medicines that all countries are advised they should stock. A UN high-level panel on access to medicines spent the best part of a year deliberating over the issues, with members from pharma companies as well as civil society and academics. It said the current setup has failed to come up with the drugs we need, whether antibiotics for all of us or cures for Zika and Ebola in low-income countries where there isn’t a market because people have no money (and because some terrifying diseases are rare). It tried to balance the conflicting demands of trade and the right to health in its final report in September 2016, in which it backed “delinkage” of the costs of R\u0026ampD from the eventual price of the drug. That’s possible if you can have some sort of deal funded by governments or philanthropists that rewards companies for getting a much-needed drug like an antibiotic into the hands of doctors, so they would not make their money from sales.The UN report has given everybody food for thought and is still being discussed. “The world must take bold new approaches,” it said, but that won’t happen quickly. The majority of big pharma, with the possible exception of GSK, whose then chief executive Sir Andrew Witty was on the panel, was unenthusiastic about the report. That might be mainly because it supported governments’ right to invoke a get-out from the World Trade Organization’s Trips agreement to bypass drug patents and make cheap versions in the interests of public health (the 2001 Doha declaration). But as happened with Aids, each new crisis over access to medicines – whether concerning a common liver disease or a rare cancer, and particularly over the antibiotics that are under threat and vital to all our lives – is likely to put pressure on companies to find ways to bring the costs of medicines down.WHO: Medicines pricing and financingWHO: Innovation, access and useUN secretary general’s high-level panel on access to medicines, final report Access to Medicines Foundation annual index on how leading pharma companies make their drugs available in poorer countriesNewsweek: How prescription drugs get their prices"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cd0a17a3c5bc0cc4df6968e8079cc55a7194ef5/5_435_2135_1281/master/2135.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7b11b088ecd10ea679d5ea632159328b 1240w","title":"amber rudd commits a serious of gross incompetence","story":"The home secretary’s launch of her violent crime strategy was devoid of feeling and substanceAmber Rudd could clearly picture the briefing document that had been left on her desk in February. Perhaps she ought to have taken a quick peek at it after all. But back then the home secretary hadn’t been entirely sure she had the necessary clearance to read something stamped “official – sensitive” and she had been awfully busy working on other things. So she had just left it in the pile marked “embarrassing documents to be leaked to the Guardian”.That decision clearly haunted Rudd as she took the platform at a central London community centre to launch her serious violence strategy. This was meant to be her big day out. Her chance to dominate the news agenda for the day and show that the government meant business in tackling the rise in violent crime.Even on her better days, the home secretary can frequently sound if she has been dosed with large quantities of valium, her delivery a deadened monotone and her expression disengaged. This most definitely was not one of her good days. Rudd looked and sounded as if someone had increased her medication. If she couldn’t physically remove herself from the torment of the ordeal, she could at least remove herself from any of the feelings associated with the experience.She began by reading out a list of people who had been killed in recent weeks. Names to which she couldn’t put a face as she hadn’t made the time to meet a single victim’s family. “People are asking ‘Why? Why? Why?’,” she said. “And as home secretary, I have been searching for an answer.” Though not so hard as to actually bother to read all the evidence that her researchers had made the effort to compile for her.Rather, after highlighting some other key social issues, she chose to press on by doubling down on her insistence that there was no correlation between violent crime and police numbers. “We can’t be distracted by political tit for tat,” she mumbled. “I want to hear solutions from other parties, not just cries of ‘cuts, cuts, cuts’.” By now Rudd was so lost she was unable to make the connection that reversing cuts both to police and social care budgets might go some way to making the situation a little better.In little more than 10 minutes – or 12 seconds for each person who had been knifed to death in London this year – the home secretary had faltered to a close. A hint of panic crossed her face as she invited questions. Inevitably, the first one was on police numbers. How come she had not read the documents, and how come there was no mention of the police in her entire 140-page strategy document?It was like this, she said unconvincingly. She wasn’t at all sure that the document she hadn’t got round to reading had even been a Home Office document. It could have just been a rogue piece of disinformation slipped in to the department by Russian sleeper agents. Besides which, she wanted her strategy to be be informed by evidence not anecdote. At this half the audience did a double-take. They could have sworn the document she hadn’t read and they had was called “Violent Crime: Latest Evidence of its Drivers”.Now the home secretary went for broke. There weren’t actually more crimes taking place. All that had happened was that more crimes were being reported as previously no one had ever bothered to count the bodies. So we were all actually a lot safer than we had been because we just hadn’t known how much danger we were in. And as this had all happened through a reduction in police numbers it made sense to try to abolish the police force entirely.Rudd wisely chose not to take any more questions from the media and scuttled off as quickly as indecently possible. In the time she had been standing, the crime figures had just gone up by one. Though this had been more of a white-collar crime. A crime of gross incompetence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34cd09783041fd7d2e0cbcb2df989c374f92ec01/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ec498cb73f2ca844fa77c99d3a25bd1f 1240w","title":"mays frictionless eu trade plan after brexit dealt blow by key ally","story":"More bureaucracy will be part of price tag for UK leaving single market, says Danish PMTheresa May’s plans for a Brexit deal that delivers frictionless trade with the EU have been dealt a blow by a key European ally who has said there will be more bureaucracy after leaving the bloc.The Danish prime minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said after talks with his UK counterpart in Copenhagen that there would be an inevitable price to pay for Britain leaving the single market.Following a bilateral meeting with May, he told reporters at a joint press conference: “We should avoid too many changes in our relations and I am totally in favour of an enhanced trade agreement between the EU and UK.The UK could sign up to all the EU’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.“I hope if there’s willingness … we will close a deal which will be as close to what we know now as possible. But we have to be realistic and we have to realise that there will be changes. Leaving the single market comes with a price tag and unfortunately the price tag is also a Danish price tag. “That is the reality of life. There will be more bureaucracy in future, unfortunately.”The European council president, Donald Tusk, has already told the UK that it should not expect frictionless trade outside the single market. “Friction is an inevitable side-effect of Brexit,” he said in March. Rasmussen, whose country is generally regarded as sympathetic toward the UK having also joined the EU in 1973, insisted Brussels was simply aiming to be “realistic and fair” in the negotiations. May also signalled that the government’s goal of cutting net annual immigration to below 100,000 would remain in place after Brexit. She said: “We recognise the concern that people in the UK have about this issue of net migration into the UK, which is why we set ourselves the target … and want to continue to work to ensure that we address that particular target.”Her position was in stark contrast to that of her home secretary, Amber Rudd, who repeatedly refused to confirm to the Commons home affairs committee last month that she was aiming to meet the target by the next election. The two leaders also discussed fishing rights, and May promised that Denmark, whose boats regularly fish in British waters, would get “fair and reciprocal access” after Brexit.Britain is braced for tough negotiations with Brussels after delaying the decision over who will control and have access to its territorial waters. The government is also facing calls at home from an increasingly belligerent fishing industry to restrict the number of foreign boats. May, who backed remaining in the EU, again refused to say whether she had changed her mind about Brexit when challenged by a Danish journalist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cccee7ad99e3159c9132e0ecea9b6e6fe736472b/245_27_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=10e7abf7927a9078f999deff73e4db8d 1240w","title":"adam peaty first defeat since 2014 commonwealth games 2018 gold coast cameron van der burgh","story":"Adam Peaty leaned into Cameron van\u0026nbspder\u0026nbspBurgh’s lane and gave him a warm handshake after the South African ended a four-year winning sequence by beating the Englishman to Commonwealth gold in the 50m breaststroke.The difference between the pair touching the wall was four hundredths of a second but that gap released one of the strongest strangleholds in world sport. It was Van\u0026nbspder\u0026nbspBurgh who last beat the 23-year-old over 50m in long course at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014.Peaty is a different animal now, decorated with 27 senior titles and, before Monday evening on Australia’s Gold Coast, had been considered by experts as nigh on unbeatable. He holds the seven fastest times in history over the distance and even his rivals admit he has transformed the discipline with his distinctive full throttle stroke. The former world champion Mark Foster believed Peaty had victory assured just by being on the starting blocks. But at a Games where the hottest of English favourites, including the Brownlee brothers and Max Whitlock, have fallen by the wayside, that sort of presumptuousness is ill-advised.By Peaty’s own standards it was a sluggish swim as he failed to overhaul Van\u0026nbspder\u0026nbspBurgh, who won in 26.58sec to Peaty’s 26.62. Another Englishman, James Wilby, won his third inidual breaststroke medal, with bronze in 27.37.Peaty, who is a double world champion in the 50m breaststroke, was magnanimous in defeat, to the delight of his mother, Caroline. “I’m glad your upbringing is showing through,” she tweeted. “True sportsmanship, very proud of you.”Peaty did not make excuses but reasoned that swimmers do not usually train to peak in April. He described the contest as “probably one of the worst feeling races I’ve ever done”. He said: “Even though it’s a silver, I’m more happy with that silver than I was with the gold the other day. It gives me a reality check. Even if you are the best in the world, world record holder, you can still be beaten. I think that’s the most valuable lesson.”Despite winning gold in the 100m breaststroke, the event in which he is Olympic champion, Peaty admonished himself for his performance. The 50m is not an Olympic distance but he is still the standout performer, his 25.95 world record more than half a second faster than the next quickest man, João Gomes, a Brazilian who had previously served a six-month ban for testing positive for a banned diuretic.Before the Games began the English swimmer Lizzie Simmonds accused British Swimming of overlooking older swimmers when they are allocating funding. But the Welshwoman Alys Thomas went some way to proving the pool is not the preserve solely of the super young. The 27-year-old shaved two seconds off her personal best time to win gold in the 200m butterfly in 2:05.45, a Games record.Thomas made her major international debut only last year, at the world championships, and also had to battle a partisan crowd in the Optic Aquatics Centre as she held off the challenge of the Australian duo of Laura Taylor and Emma McKeon, who took silver and bronze respectively.“I couldn’t see anything,” Thomas said. “My goggles were smudged up so I just swam my own race. I bet my coach if I did this I could shave his head so I guess I’m shaving his head. I’m 27 and this is my first major international medal. I’m finally breaking through now. It says something about being patient when you’re young.”Away from the pool England continued their dominance in the gymnastics. Nile Wilson won his third gold medal of the Games with victory in the men’s high bar. His score of 14.533 was half a point down on his qualifying mark but still enough to beat team-mate James Hall, who shared silver with Canada’s Cory Paterson.It means the 22-year-old will leave Australia with five medals, having also won silver on the parallel bars on Monday.Alice Kinsella claimed gold in the beam. The 17-year-old, who is the daughter of the former Republic of Ireland footballer Mark Kinsella, finished ahead of Australia’s Georgia-Rose Brown and her English team-mate Kelly Simm, who took bronze."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52d6e0e26988d92bfdd3ea3ec78dd8d3acb0742e/0_147_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8d557f5a82e3d736a1d20509cdb704d4 1720w","title":"michael bennett not being heard is ultimately my greatest fear","story":"The Pro Bowl defensive end, activist and author discusses a life spent on the margins, his kinship with Colin Kaepernick and finding his voice in Trump’s AmericaLast September, before a pre-season game for the Seattle Seahawks, Michael Bennett sat down while the Star-Spangled Banner resounded around him. A celebratory playing of the anthem is the precursor to every game in the NFL and Bennett could no longer stand it. He had won the Super Bowl, and twice been a Pro Bowl selection, but distressing images swamped the football.A few weeks earlier a large far-right group had marched in Charlottesville. They carried burning torches and chanted “You will not replace us” and the Nazi slogan “Blood and soil” as they clashed with black and white counter-protesters. The mood turned even uglier the next day, 12 August 2017, when a car plowed into a crowd of people protesting against the Alt-Right. A woman was killed and 19 people were injured.“Seeing that was so emotional,” Bennett says now, on a rainy morning in Los Angeles, as he explains why he joined Colin Kaepernick in protesting against racism in America by refusing to stand for the anthem. Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers’ quarterback, has now been shut out of the NFL. The fate of Kaepernick and the shooting last June of Charleena Lyles, an African American mother of four killed by the police in Seattle, were also in Bennett’s head.“So many different things were emotional last year,” Bennett says. “But seeing people in Charlottesville trying to make change, and being attacked, was like a photo from Time magazine in 1968. You’re seeing the same thing but the colors are brighter and the shoes are different. But it was the same experience, the same intensity.“It made me understand that all of us play a part in having a safe world – and made me feel more than ever I needed to make sure that what Colin did was not forgotten but taken further. Colin’s protest might have been about police brutality but for me it was more about safety for all people whatever their gender, race, religion or political belief. I could not stand for the anthem until that safety was secured.”Bennett also felt compelled to act after Donald Trump initially refused to comment on the Charlottesville attack – and when he did speak the President praised the “many fine people on both sides”. For Bennett, “that was the defining moment. It blew my mind and I still can’t believe he said it. Maya Angelou said, ‘Words are so strong, they stick to things.’ So he should be careful when talking to this next generation.”Bennett had been moved when meeting the family of Charleena Lyles after her killing. There was widespread belief she was yet another victim of the police using excessive force against African Americans. Lyles had pleaded for help when reporting a burglary but the police shot her because they suspected she carried a knife. “You want to make it better for them,” Bennett says of her children, “but when you are in the room and feel the essence of their suffering in the air it’s hard. There’s no way you can tell them it’s going to be OK. There’s hurt, pain and anger. But they helped me understand we all need to try and help change the country.” Such turmoil, especially in Charlottesville, evoked the fear Bennett had felt growing up in Texas. When he was 13, in 1998, Bennett was shaken by the death of a middle-aged African American. James Byrd was lynched by three white supremacists who then hooked his body to a pick-up truck. They dragged his corpse for three miles.This is not a typical conversation with a sporting celebrity. In our two hours together Bennett will discuss his recent trade from the Seahawks to the Philadelphia Eagles, the reigning Super Bowl champions, and he will reveal the fear even he, a powerful defensive end, feels every time he steps onto the football field at the age of 32.The title of his absorbing new book, Things That Make White People Uncomfortable, seems typical of the combative and humorously provocative character Bennett displays in public. Yet the subject of his book ensures that Bennett is much more serious in person. He is also intent on showing his support for women and fellow African Americans, and his belief in the power of the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements, and explaining how his wife, and the two women who have been his mother, and his three daughters have shaped him.A week after we meet, Bennett hits trouble when a charge is belatedly laid against him for allegedly pushing a disabled security officer, a 66-year-old woman, at the Super Bowl 15 months ago. It is a charge, I learn later, he denies strenuously. The impact has been painful. Apart from fighting a time-consuming legal battle he considers erroneous, Bennett was forced to cancel a book tour last week which means that all other interviews and publicity have been cancelled. The timing of the charge against him is, at the least, curious.Yet before we catch up to the present it is striking how Bennett draws a bleak link between the death of Byrd and the even more infamous lynching of Emmett Till – the 14-year-old black boy who was murdered by a mob after a white woman made a false accusation against him in Mississippi in 1955. How did Byrd’s lynching affect Bennett as a boy? “It was scary as a black kid. You thought: ‘Could it happen to me?’ Every time you heard a pick-up truck, which happens a lot in Texas, you went cold. But my parents did a good job showing the positives of the rest of society. We were taught not to put one brutal act on everybody.”It is unsurprising Bennett felt affinity with Kaepernick’s peaceful but controversial protests during the anthem – when he sat at first and then took a knee throughout 2016 as he established himself as the 49ers’ starting quarterback. But since March 2017, Kaepernick has remained unsigned as NFL owners sidestep the political attention that surrounds him.Was Bennett aware of the bold decision Kaepernick had made at the very outset? “Not at first. I talked to Colin a couple of weeks later. I was like, ‘Oh, wow, that’s a big step to put that weight on your back.’ I didn’t want to leave him behind. I wanted to be able to be a brother in something so big.”Kaepernick has suffered as an outcast in sporting, financial and social terms but Bennett believes his friend has won a larger war. “He might not play this year but look at all these young kids taking knees. You see the global reach of his name and what he’s done to different communities. He’s not just a football player anymore– he’s a global leader for change.”They were in New York together last year and Kaepernick’s influence was obvious. “People reacted to him in a way I’d never seen in regard to an athlete,” Bennett says. “People said to Colin: ‘You gave me hope. You spoke for me. I’m grateful for your sacrifice.’ That was very different to other athletes I’ve been around. With Odell Beckham people are infatuated with the way he caught the ball with one hand or with Russell Wilson they love the way he runs with the ball. This was love and respect for Colin as a man.”How is Kaepernick, in private, away from his political status and sporting isolation? “It’s lonely and I’m not sure when he took that knee he thought this would happen. So the first thing I ask him when I text is: ‘How are you feeling spiritually and mentally?’ Most of the time he’s feeling really good and he’s still working out hard every single day. I think there’s still opportunity for him to get back into the league. People who have raped women or been accused of murder or domestic abuse are still playing. That’s the hardest thing for me to accept: why doesn’t he have the opportunity?”Bennett hails 24 September 2017 as a rare day when the NFL expressed solidarity against racism and the verbal attacks Trump has made on its political players. Over 180 players, coaches and even team owners showed some form of protest during the anthem. “It was a big moment. The National Football League don’t take those risks normally. That day they did. “The NBA has always been more progressive because of the people who are the face of basketball. LeBron James is the leader of US sport not just because of his stature and skill but his wisdom and consciousness. This is the first time in a long time we have an athlete as fluent and well-known as LeBron who has spoken out on the real issues in America. You can’t name another athlete with that type of stature who has taken LeBron’s major risk. Not Tiger Woods, not Tom Brady, not Michael Jordan, not Derek Jeter, not Alex Rodriguez. LeBron, the kid from Akron, is the chosen one on and off the court.”His younger brother Martellus is often scathing of the NFL – even being quoted as suggesting the organization might as well stand for Niggers For Lease. Michael is more diplomatic. “It’s not the NFL’s job to push for change. They are a corporation and big companies don’t push for change. So it’s about the players growing our mindsets and speaking the truth.”Bennett has often been tested. Last September, after watching Floyd Mayweather fight Conor McGregor, Bennett was caught in a rush in Las Vegas when people mistakenly believed there had been a shooting. As he ran from the scene, Bennett was brought down by the police. He was pinned to the ground, and cuffed, while a policeman put a gun to his head. Bennett was only released when the police realised he was a famous football player rather than a gunman.“It was a scary moment – but the hardest part was explaining to my daughters that these incidents happen and you need to move forward. How can my daughters have a positive outlook if their dad is scared to talk about what happened to him?”Bennett now faces a more tangled situation – following his indictment for allegedly pushing a paraplegic woman in his haste to get onto the field to celebrate with Martellus, playing for the New England Patriots, after last year’s Super Bowl in Houston. As Bennett cannot respond for legal reasons his lawyer Rusty Hardin defends him.“I’m absolutely convinced he did not push the woman,” Hardin tells me. “It’s always possible she’s got Michael confused with somebody else, who might have pushed her, but we won’t know until we see what’s in their file.”Houston’s police chief, Art Acevedo, held a grandstanding press conference, announcing the indictment and accusing Bennett of being “morally bankrupt”. Hardin says: “I consider the chief a friend but he was way out of line. He’s going to be embarrassed about it ultimately.”The Eagles are also known for their political consciousness and Bennett relishes his imminent move to Philadelphia. But he believes that many players in the NFL and college football suffer from depression. “So many athletes I know are dealing with depression. There’s not really a team to help us understand what we’re feeling – because depression is never talked about in sports. It’s just the ‘D’ word and we often have 22-year-old athletes who, mentally, are like 10-year-olds. We’re often still crawling mentally and we need to stand up and refocus.”More violent damage frames every NFL game and Bennett knows that severe head trauma is a persistent danger. Does he fear something terrible might happen in a game? “I feel that every single time. I don’t think you can trust any player that say they don’t fear. You fear every single time because you can be badly hurt. Last year two of my teammates cracked vertebrae in their neck. You try to make yourself not scared but as you get older you get more scared.”Different wounds can heal. The most moving pages in Bennett’s book chart his reconciliation with his birth mother, Caronda, who had had five children by the time she was 22. Michael and Martellus were brought up his father and his new partner whom they regarded as their real mother. Yet Bennett has now transcended his feelings of being abandoned by Cardonda. “I call it the forgiveness chapter and I talk about sitting at this big table on Mother’s Day with my kids. It’s the first time I can remember spending Mother’s Day with my mom. I couldn’t stop crying because I had always pictured seeing this as a kid. I became a better man by finding a way to forgive my mom and have empathy to understand her story.”Bennett is a multi-millionaire but his mother has lived a constrained life. When they met again he discovered she has never seen the sea. “I’m having my mom do things she’s never done – as though I was the parent and she was the daughter. But you need that compassion.”Has this understanding of his mother also softened bitterness towards white people who have caused hurt? “Yeah. You need to embrace the past to see what happened but you also need to move forward and forgive. Most of the people I meet are not the person who caused unhappiness. I would never want to be like the far right or the far left. I don’t feel every police officer or politician is a terrible person. We all need to grow by acknowledging everything that happened but move forward to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”All the intensity drains away as Bennett picks up his breakfast burrito and carefully removes the onions. “My only intolerance now,” he says with a grin, “is against onions.”He takes a bite out of his onion-free burrito. “The world is definitely crazy right now,” he says, chewing cheerfully, “but you don’t want your kids to live in fear. You want to take away that fear and help them change the world into a better place – for all of us.”Now, weeks later, Bennett is no longer free. As innocent as he feels, the maximum sentence, if he is found guilty of intentionally injuring a person over 65, is 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. I asked Hardin for his gut feeling about the case: “It depends on whether we can find sufficient evidence to convince them this woman’s wrong. If that’s the case I’m comfortable it will go away. It’s either going to be dismissed or trialled. But I know Michael didn’t do it. He’s not guilty.”Bennett waits alongside Colin Kaepernick, on the margins, silenced for now but still leading a protest against injustice. In Los Angeles we also spoke about his greatest fear.“You’re always nervous,” Bennett said, not knowing then how his book’s publication would be overshadowed. “You’re going to be judged on your beliefs. But the fear of not being heard is ultimately my greatest fear. To explain why we sit during the anthem drove me to write the book. When you’re in this box, as an athlete, you can’t say how you really feel. There are so many things controlling you – the league, your team or the brands you’re associated with. But you want to be heard, regardless of the sport. You just want to be heard as a human being.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d053ada30628d2f6367b4d010a8bd4d860b59d41/0_393_5214_3129/master/5214.jpg?w=5000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7dca1f97751c1a4080f2b576a83c999 10000w","title":"commonwealth games days four and five in pictures","story":"All the latest images from the past 48 hours of action at the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast as gymnasts, swimmers, boxers and weightlifters battle for medals"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36e59a88fd6bd678de766dd4b2af925b9a79c82a/0_158_7152_4291/master/7152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a53ef25a7962e24902f801c14ed331c2 1240w","title":"concrete dreams new show celebrates southbanks history of performance","story":"Exclusive: exhibition looks back on London cultural centre’s legacy through 50 years of archive material An innovative new exhibition at London’s Southbank Centre gives visitors a performer’s perspective of its newly renovated brutalist venues, the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room.Concrete Dreams, which opens on Tuesday, is a tour through 50 years of archive material, imaginatively presented in dressing rooms, bathrooms and other backstage areas. It is a tribute to the eclectic talents who have played there over the years. Rifle through a box of index cards and find handwritten notes recording performance dates for Stan Getz, Roaring Jelly and André Previn.In one room, you can watch a Deep Purple gig, scan one of David Bowie’s set lists, see Cleo Laine’s dressing room sign and programmes for poetry festivals featuring Wole Soyinka.Meticulously kept attendance books list artists who played there and how many tickets they sold. Pick up the receiver of a dial telephone and hear oral histories from those who worked at the venues. Concrete Dreams is heaven for architecture nerds too. Original hand-drawn plans for the building line the corridor walls and are used in animations projected on to office windows, accompanied by Steve Reich’s music. You can watch TV documentaries about London’s 60s building boom and listen to Harold Wilson’s 1963 speech about the “white heat” of technology. In wood-panelled dressing rooms, concrete cores removed from the QEH during rewiring are displayed alongside scale models. The tour ends with an arresting live performance in the Purcell Room that captures the venues’ incredibly eclectic artistic history with sophistication, style and humour. The finale features footage of Merce Cunningham’s dancers, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and Lemn Sissay among many others.The exhibition has been created by design practice LYN Atelier and performer collective KlangHaus, who had a hit at the Edinburgh festival in 2014 with an atmospheric gig-come-installation staged in a former small-animal hospital. That show was a sort of musical mystery tour, with projections on the walls and performers popping up in unexpected places, playing right under the audience’s noses.The company’s ethos is to make “a collaboration with buildings” and they say they became obsessed with concrete while preparing the new exhibition. They have even used tracks by musicians who trained as architects: the composer Iannis Xenakis and Pink Floyd.KlangHaus’s Jon Baker explains that they chose to open and end the tour with birdsong – a reference to the bird noises on Cirrus Minor by Pink Floyd, who played at the QEH in 1967, and to the influence of birdsong on other artists whose work has been heard at the venues, from Olivier Messiaen to gamelan musicians. “We had this weird notion that when you build a building, what you’re actually doing is enclosing the outside. You’re colonising a space that was once outside,” says Baker. “So we wanted to bring the sound of birds into the building.” As part of the Concrete Dreams season, there will be a concert of Sam Lee’s Singing With Nightingales, an evening of “human-bird duets”. Georgia Ward, participation producer at the Southbank, said: “We wanted to talk about the amazing history and design of these buildings, but also the performative history. There were some real firsts here: Mike Oldfield’s Tubular Bells, Jessye Norman did an extraordinary performance, Different Trains by Steve Reich. We knew KlangHaus could play with the archive in a beautiful, creative way.”The Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall was built in 1951 for the Festival of Britain. Sixteen years later, it added the QEH, for classical music, dance and opera, and the smaller Purcell Room for chamber music, solo concerts and cabaret. Concrete Dreams also acknowledges the history of the Hayward Gallery, which opened in 1968. A backstage bathroom features displays from the Hayward’s 1969 pop art show and the 1972 exhibition The New Art, where Gilbert and George were billed as George and Gilbert. On the bathroom wall, beautiful silhouettes of photographed visitors at the gallery’s 1970 Kinetics exhibition stand out against the white tiles. The free, one-hour guided tours, supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, are designed for 15 visitors at a time. Concrete Dreams runs until 29 April and culminates in a three-day festival including a workshop run by the Rambert dance company who once rehearsed in the QEH’s foyer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ca75fd08a472aa29a0874fbda39bb787a63845/0_270_4900_2939/master/4900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c58b36b37e5693b0862f215a3ecde9f4 1240w","title":"mark zuckerberg facebook testimony congress","story":"Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg will defend the social platform as a “positive force in the world” when he addresses Congress on Tuesday while admitting he made “a big mistake” by not taking seriously the social network’s responsibility to its two billion users.Zuckerberg, facing a firestorm of criticism over Facebook’s cavalier attitude to its users data, released his prepared written remarks on Monday, ahead of two appearances before Congress this week when lawmakers will quiz him about a range of failings including the privacy scandal involving political consultant Cambridge Analytica and Russian use of the platform ahead of the US election.“Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company,” his statement reads. “But it’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy. We didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I’m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here.”In two days of hearings, Zuckerberg will be grilled over the company’s privacy policies in the wake of revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm associated with Donald Trump’s election campaign, had access to data on 87 million of its users.Zuckerberg and Facebook chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, have been on a media apology tour since the Cambridge Analytica story broke in the Observer, the Guardian’s sister Sunday newspaper in the UK, and have already made many of the points addressed in his speech. The news has led to calls for greater regulation on both sides of the Atlantic and for users to delete their accounts.Zuckerberg’s prepared remarks mix a defence of his view of Facebook’s positive role in the wider body politic with a pledge to take more action to defend users’ privacy.“As Facebook has grown, people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool to stay connected to the people they love, make their voices heard, and build communities and businesses. Just recently, we’ve seen the #MeToo movement and the March for Our Lives, organized, at least in part, on Facebook. After Hurricane Harvey, people raised more than $20m for relief. And more than 70m small businesses now use Facebook to grow and create jobs,” the statement reads. “But it’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.”Cambridge Analytica was able to siphon off huge amounts of personal data from Facebook users by using a quiz that allowed it to gain access to the data of friends of people who took the quiz despite the fact that they had no knowledge that their information was being accessed.Zuckerberg will outline his plan to prevent similar occurrences in the future, including:Zuckerberg will also concede that the company was “too slow to spot and respond to Russian interference, and we’re working hard to get better. Our sophistication in handling these threats is growing and improving quickly,” he writes before admitting that approximately 126 million people may have been served content from a Facebook page associated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA) – a Russian agency that attempted to manipulate people in the US, Europe and Russia ahead of elections.Facebook now has about 15,000 people working on security and content review and will have more than 20,000 by the end of this year.From now on, every advertiser who wants to run political or issue ads will need to be authorized.Despite the controversy, Zuckerberg is preparing a robust defense of the company. “I believe deeply in what we’re doing. And when we address these challenges, I know we’ll look back and view helping people connect and giving more people a voice as a positive force in the world,” he writes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d08d077acbe73a32d1ff12c60bcc37fd65fc04e0/155_242_2671_2142/master/2671.jpg?w=2500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a32557c5aecfe5c014ef0b413a075575 5000w","title":"jerome avenue new york city working class areas in pictures","story":"Photographs have gone on display from a project documenting and celebrating the workers and tradespeople of Jerome Avenue, in the Bronx, where many people still make a living in small shops and factories.

Photos taken earlier this month showed a jagged shoreline around one of the islands as wave-absorbing concrete blocks appeared separated from the protective barrier and partly submerged.The photos have prompted concern about the structural integrity of the island, built by a Chinese contractor, which connects the bridge to an undersea tunnel. Hong Kong’s highway department sent its director of highways to the mainland city of Zhuhai to meet project officials, and has said it would monitor the works of the bridge to ensure “quality meets the relevant requirements”. In response to the release of the photos, officials at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Authority in Zhuhai said the placement of the blocks was by design. Previously the bridge authority said the blocks, known as “dolosse” were purposely arranged in a “random manner” to alleviate pressure on the undersea tunnel.The project, now in construction for nine years, has been dogged by delays, lawsuits and budget overruns. The bridge, originally slated to open in 2016, is expected to be operational sometime this year, according to Hong Kong officials. Supporters of the project say that by connecting the three cities of Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai to China’s Pearl River Delta region, the area will emerge as a major economic hub. Critics say the bridge is just another way for China to tighten its hold over Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous special administrative region that has chafed under Beijing’s authority.The bridge authority also released photos of the island before and after the deadly Typhoon Hato last August to show that the blocks’ protective functions had worked.Hong Kong’s top official has also tried to assuage concerns. Chief executive Carrie Lam said on Friday that the “stability of construction works is a scientifically proven thing.”“I hope that just because some iniduals have taken photos or made some comments, that everyone will not jump in and doubt the project’s design,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6362a8f127b8365724f498dc6d51921d116bd2c4/0_131_3115_1870/master/3115.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ec9e3f7d618cbaed7cb8f3d683223f77 1240w","title":"hungary liberals torrid four years viktor orban landslide","story":"Crushing victory means PM has power to remould Hungary and possibly even the entire EUViktor Orbán embarks on another four years in power newly emboldened, as his crushing victory in a parliamentary vote on Sunday gives him the power to remould Hungary.For Hungary’s beleaguered liberals, who were unable to overcome internal isions to unite against Fidesz and were trounced at the polls, a torrid four years are in store. Orbán is likely to brush off outside criticism that the vote was unfair and double down on his campaign against civil society and independent media. “This is the absolute worst-case scenario,” said Zsuzsanna Szelényi, a former independent MP. “This new majority coupled with the high turnout will mean Fidesz feels more legitimate, and Orbán will be able to use this new strength in its dealings with Brussels.”Over the past eight years, Orbán has been accused of backsliding on democratic norms, appointing loyalists to head previously independent institutions, and taking indirect control of much of the media market. With Fidesz extremely strong in parliament, this is likely to continue. After a speech in March in which Orbán promised to seek “moral, political and legal amends” against his enemies after the election, nobody can say they were not warned. “Orbán does not like to have islands of autonomy around him, and so in this new term we can see further moves against those that are remaining, including NGOs and the judiciary, which is still fairly independent,” said Szelényi.Orbán will see the result as a resounding endorsement of the single-issue campaign he ran on immigration, using far-right rhetoric to claim the opposition would allow mass migration, and that this would bring more terrorism, rape and other crime to Hungary. The message was disseminated relentlessly by the state media and government-funded billboards. Now that he has won, it is unlikely that the rhetoric will be toned down.First on the agenda could be the controversial “stop Soros” set of laws. Meant to combat the supposed nefarious plots of the Hungarian-American financier George Soros to undermine Hungary, they could be put before parliament in the coming weeks. The Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán has used scaremongering tactics about migrants and refugees as the cornerstone of his politics in the past few years, but in classic populist style, he has also required a shadowy, nefarious overlord to target. In Orbán’s case, that figure has been George Soros, who perfectly fits the bill as both insider and outsider in Hungary.Soros was born György Schwartz to a family of Hungarian Jews in 1930, but his father changed their surname to make it more Hungarian. His family split up and lived under assumed identities to escape the Holocaust, and Soros left Hungary in 1947 to study in London. He later emigrated to the US, making billions as an investor and hedge fund manager. His Open Society foundations have donated billions to promoting civil society and human rights, particularly in the former Communist countries of central and eastern Europe.Soros is a favoured target of rightwing governments worldwide, including in Israel. Hungarian officials have used criticism of Soros by Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to deflect allegations of antisemitism around their own anti-Soros campaign.However, at times, the rhetoric appears to borrow heavily from antisemitic tropes. In a March\u0026nbspspeech\u0026nbspin which he accused the political opposition of being “Soros candidates”, Orbán referred to his enemies as “not straightforward but crafty not honest but base not national but international does not believe in working but speculates with money”.“Many of those organisations who camouflage themselves as human rights groups that are trying to help people to get rid of their misery are actually helping to foster illegal migration,” said Orbán’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, before the vote.Civil society representatives have said the bill is fundamentally different from previous pieces of legislation aimed at the sector, which were stigmatising but could be sidestepped. Even before the official results were announced on Sunday night, Kovács told the Hungarian website Index that “organisations interfering with politics need to be shut down”. On Monday morning, a Fidesz spokesman said on state television that parliament would pass the law in May. At risk are the few remaining NGOs that offer legal or humanitarian assistance for migrants and refugees.Ákos Hadházy, co-chair of the liberal LMP party, said he was stepping down after the vote. He refused to congratulate Fidesz or Orbán and said the election was neither fair nor honest. “There will be grave political and economic consequences to follow, and Hungary is close to no longer being part of the EU,” he added.

Israel has not, as a rule, attacked al-Qaida or Islamic State positions in Syria.On all previous occasions, Russia – which has controlled Syrian air space since it sent troops to defend the regime of Bashar al-Assad in 2015 – has turned a blind eye. There had been an understanding that Israeli interests in Syria would be preserved by Russia, primarily by limiting the presence of Iranian-backed troops in Syria’s south-west. The Israeli fear is that access to the Syrian side of the Golan Heights allows Hezbollah to launch attacks into Israel.It has not always been clear how much prior notification of these raids Israel gives Moscow, or how much there is an understanding that Russia will not tip off the Syrian regime. On most occasions, the Pentagon is given prior notice. Israel neither confirms nor denies attacks.The raid on Sunday night was different in that it was denounced by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as “a very dangerous development”.It shows the extent to which Israel has become concerned that Russia is not fulfilling the bargain to control Iran and its military proxies. In recent weeks, Israel has sent out three warning signals: it conducted a military exercise in which Russia operates a multi-front war to prevent an Israeli attack on Syria it publicly confirmed that it had launched airstrikes in 2007 against a potential nuclear reactor in Syria and it launched a multi-front air raid in February inside Syria in response to a drone flying into Israel. The latter was described as the biggest attack the Israeli air force had mounted inside Syria since the 1982 Lebanon war.Israel believes the political alliance between Russia and Iran over Syria’s future is strengthening. And its hope that Iranian forces, by some accounts 80,000 strong, will not have a permanent presence in Syria, especially in the south-west, looks increasingly forlorn.So Israel’s assault on Sunday night can be read as much as an opportunistic raid seizing on the outrage over the alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma to prosecute pre-existing battles rather than to punish the Syrian government.But Israel is also sending a message to the US president, Donald Trump, by pointing out the consequences for his anti-Iran policy if he goes ahead with his plan to withdraw the remaining 2,000 US troops from Syria. Israel is telling the US that it cannot see the Syrian war solely as a battle to defeat Isis it must also be seen as a battleground about Iranian expansionism.Some will argue that the best hope for peace lies in leaving the solution to Tehran and Moscow. The future of Syria will no longer be decided in Geneva under a UN peace process led by Staffan de Mistura, but by Russia, Iran and Turkey through the so-called Astana process.Israel’s raid was an attempt to tell Rouhani he will be proved wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f65953f5835ca554f0f22776ff535e0151351cb/142_299_4699_2819/master/4699.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6755e3940d871fae76ac8fa53a98c19a 1240w","title":"number of britons gaining eu citizenship more than doubled in 2016","story":"Data shows numbers more than doubled to 6,555 in 2016 compared with previous yearThe number of Britons becoming citizens of another European Union country more than doubled in 2016, the year the UK voted to leave the bloc, official figures show.Following the EU referendum, many Britons are thought to have applied for citizenship of other bloc members to be sure they will still have the right to travel and work freely in the remaining 27 states.The figures shows that Britons becoming nationals of other EU states has become a steadily rising trend in over the past decade, with the 2016 figure more than four times higher than in 2007. Germany was the biggest recipient in 2016, with 2,702 Britons taking citizenship there – more than four times the 2015 figure of 594. Belgium, where thousands of Britons hold jobs in Brussels that may depend on their being EU citizens, granted passports to 506 of them in 2016, four times as many as in 2015. Anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain said the government should be “ashamed that people feel they have no option but to give up their citizenship or apply to be a dual national”.“These people are giving up part of their identity to try and secure their future,” the group’s spokesman Paul Butters said.The figures from Eurostat came as ant-Brexit campaigners claimed that more than 120 questions about the future rights of EU citizens in the UK remain unanswered by the government.Grassroot activists at the3million group have sent the list to the Home Office ahead of a meeting next week with immigration minister Caroline Nokes.The campaigners, who are lobbying for all social and employment rights to be extended beyond Brexit, accused ministers of failing to provide detail even though they are planning to start registering EU citizens for a new immigration status from September. “The list of questions shows the huge gap between the claim that citizens’ rights are done and dusted and the reality for EU citizens still waiting for answers, 655 days after the Brexit referendum,” said the3million co founder Nicolas Hatton. “Let’s say you have lived in the UK for 30 or 40 years, have lost all contact with family and friends in your home country and your application is rejected. Where do you go to start your appeal? What do you do? Where on God’s earth do you go?” one Italian national, who preferred not to be named in the UK, said.  They also want answers on children’s rights, communications plans and protection from the hostile environment policy the Home Office operates for migrants it wants to deport. The hostile environment involves a lock down of benefits for the migrant deemed to be unlawfully in the UK. This can include the freezing of bank accounts, cancellation of driving licences, child benefit, the ending of employment contracts and eviction from rental property. They also want to know what protections are planned for EU citizens in the event of Home Office errors. Last year, the government was forced to apologise after mistakenly sending out deportation letters to around 100 EU citizens.“It is crucial for all 128 questions to be answered so we can have confidence in the government’s application scheme,” said Hatton.

Photograph: Cyril Byrne Dublin City councillors have called on the Minister for Housing to intervene to prevent an appeal over plans to build almost 1,000 social and affordable houses at the Irish Glass Bottle site on Dublin’s Poolbeg peninsula.Last May, the council said it reached a deal with then minister for environment Simon Coveney, Nama and receiver that State funding would be made available to bring the number of social and affordable homes in Poolbeg up to 900.However, the plans were recently appealed by the site’s receiver Deloitte which wants to reduce the number of social and affordable homes to a maximum of 350.At Monday’s sitting of Dublin City Council, councillors unanimously backed emergency motions callings on Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy to ensure the appeal is withdrawn.The motions also called for the Minister to publish details of any agreement reached with his department over the provision of social and affordable homes on the site.Separate motions were proposed by members of Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and the Green Party.Cllr Daithí Doolan (Sinn Féin) said the appeal amounted to a “fingers up at Dublin City Council” and insisted that Mr Murphy intervene to protect an agreement forged by councillors and the local community.“We need the Minister to wake up, stand up for Dublin . . . the Minister must wake up and stop sleepwalking this city into a crisis,” he said.Cllr Dermot Lacey (Labour) said the appeal amounted to an “extraordinary breach of trust”, while Cllr Patrick Costello (Green) said the move was a “betrayal” of the local community.Chief executive of Dublin City Council Owen Keegan told the meeting he was “surprised and shocked” when he learned of the appeal.He said he had told the Department of the Housing that he felt the actions of the receiver were “inconsistent with the terms of the agreement” reached over the development.Mr Keegan added that the onus was on the department to “deliver for all”, and that if the appeal was successful, it was possible that only 10 per cent of units – about 350 – would be set aside for social and affordable use, in line with planning legislation. This is much lower then the 30 per cent agreed by councillors.The council has been preparing plans for the new urban quarter on the peninsula, since it received Cabinet approval for the project in May 2016.All of the 3,500 apartments, designed to house some 8,000 people, would be built on the former Irish Glass Bottle Company lands and the smaller neighbouring Fabrizia site, which combined cover about 15 hectares (12.4 acres). Both sites are in receivership with Deloitte, but the city council owns around one quarter of the Glass Bottle site.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?The Crossword Club provides access to an archive of more than 6,000 interactive crosswords from The Irish Times.

File photograph: Eric LukeLidl is considering taking legal action over what it says are “factual inaccuracies which have been blatantly mis-communicated” in a recently published grocery pricing survey of own-brand products commissioned by Aldi. In the survey carried out by retail analysts at Grant Thornton and published last week, both the German discounters were shown to be significantly cheaper than Tesco, Dunnes Stores or Supervalu. The basket of 62 own-brand products, which included jam, cream, honey, ice-cream, rice, orange juice, cheese, yoghurt, bread, as well as fruit and vegetables, was found to cost on average €65.04 in Aldi, €65.53 in Lidl, €76.54 in Tesco, €80.74 in Dunnes Stores and €95.50 in SuperValu.Supervalu and Tesco have also raised concerns about the survey, while Dunnes Stores made no comment. While it indicated a wafer-thin margin of less than 1 per cent between the German discounters, a Lidl spokeswoman dismissed the survey for having “numerous discrepancies” and said that by its own calculations, it was the cheapest supermarket in Ireland. She said the Aldi survey had suggested there were different prices in Lidl shops in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick “despite the fact that Lidl always uses uniform pricing” across all its stores. She pointed out that in the apple category, the Aldi survey listed €1.49 as a weighted comparison for Lidl’s Oakland Red Apple Tray in Dublin and Galway while in Limerick and Cork, the survey used the price of Lidl’s Pink Lady Apples which cost €2.99 She also highlighted two differed strawberry jams priced in Lidl, one which cost €0.90 and another “premium conserve” which was put at €1.93 as well as two differed prices for its bacon. “When the three errors listed above are amended and the correct products and prices are compared, Lidl’s total basket price should be €64.04 which is a full €1 cheaper than Aldi,” she said. “Lidl is currently looking into legal options around the factual inaccuracies which have been blatantly miscommunicated by Grant Thornton and Aldi.”In response an unapologetic Aldi said it stood over its report. “The independent Grant Thornton survey confirmed what Aldi and our customers already know - Aldi are the lowest priced and best value supermarket in Ireland,” a spokesman said.

But the UK has narrowed its options and the talks will expose the lack of realism and contradictions in its negotiating position, and the isions within its ranks, Irish EU commissioner Phil Hogan warns.“Stepping into Global Britain is stepping into a difficult world. And there will be a huge gap between hope and experience,” he warns.The commissioner for agriculture and rural development will tell a Brussels Dublin City University (DCU) seminar on Monday morning , “an EU27 perspective on the future EU-UK relationship”, that “one thing we have already learned from Brexit is that the UK does not have a better idea: it does not have a replacement for the union as a way to improve the life quality of its citizens, its businesses, and its standing in the world.“Yes, it will leave the union but it only wants to go some of the way towards leaving. We can see, now that things have become clearer, that there is a lot of the union that the UK wants to retain. An awful lot.“You might say it doesn’t want to change its EU outfit, just its shoes.”He will say that in other circumstances prime minister Theresa May’s recent Munich speech would have been seen as a “a strong argument for joining, not leaving, the EU”. But he warns that the “long game” played by the UK in the negotiations means that the talks on a political statement on the framework of the future relationship, due to be finalised by this autumn alongside the withdrawal agreement, may not answer all the questions about the shape of that relationship. Mr Hogan will cast doubt on many of the assumptions that Ms May makes: “She is confident that regaining its power to negotiate trade agreements will enable the UK to achieve greater wellbeing for its people through wider trade. One hopes she is right for the sake of UK citizens.”But “Global Britain will mean for the United Kingdom a return to medium-sized nation status. Yes it will regain the sovereignty to seek and strike agreements where it wants but with reduced bargaining power, reduced security of its markets and supply chains, and a friction and cost added to each trade shipment to the EU, its biggest trade partner.”He warns that sterling could be very sensitive to new trade imbalances, that a deal with the US, particularly on agricultural products may not be as easy as expected, and that reliance on Commonwealth links will not be sufficient to compensate for a break with the EU – EU-UK trade is six times higher than UK exports to the 10 largest Commonwealth countries.The UK may also be disappointed in its hope to roll forward on current terms for existing trade agreements with third countries.On the outcome of talks, Mr Hogan warns that the EU is left with few options. “The EU might have its own preference between the three possible outcomes on a final agreement – free trade agreement, customs union, single market. We might have a preference but we have to realise that there is nothing we can do to realise it. The UK has decided that it wants a free trade agreement and that must be our focus.”Of the isions within Tory ranks, he says that “What I have called the London-London part of the negotiation has been a lively conversation between several opposing camps, although it is showing signs of calming recently.“This may be because the different camps are preparing for battles to come, or are concentrating on other things like the local elections on May 3rd, or consider the clock to have been reset to December 2020 by the draft withdrawal treaty. “It may be calmer but there does not seem to have been a reconciliation between the opposing camps.” Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3454902.1523211484!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"berlin-irish-campaign-to-repeal-eighth-amendment-1.3454909","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBanner at Bei Ruth, a warehouse hidden inside a bare industrial estate between Berlin’s erse Neukölln and Treptow areas. Photograph: Rachel LoxtonIf it wasn’t for a giant poster of a pair of knickers on the wall, it would look like a typical Friday night at a Berlin club.The poster, with “Repeal the 8th” written across it in red, is attached to the wall with masking tape. It brightens up Bei Ruth, a party warehouse hidden inside a bare industrial estate, sandwiched between Berlin’s erse Neukölln and Treptow areas.Tonight the venue has become a gathering for Irish people – more than 1,300km away from where the referendum on May 25th will take place.The referendum will ask voters if they want to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which grants equal right to life to the mother and unborn child.The Berlin-Ireland pro-choice solidarity group organised “Plugged in for Repeal” to highlight how people can vote in the referendum or campaign, as well as raise money and remove the stigma of abortion.Dozens of people have already arrived at 9.30pm. At the door a suggested donation of €5 or €10 encouraged.The atmosphere is intense but cheerful as conversation moves from serious talk on the effects of the Eighth Amendment to “soli shots” (solidarity shots) and homemade Guinness cake.Is this an occasion to celebrate or prepare for the fight ahead? Both it seems.Maebh Murphy, from Waterford, moved to Berlin in 2008. The 33 year old, who works in the music industry, co-founded the pro-choice group with Dervla O’Malley, in 2012.She says “the buzz” of the party is because the referendum is finally happening – and feels fairly positive about the outcome.Under Irish electoral law, Irish citizens retain their right to vote for 18 months after moving abroad. There is no postal vote from abroad so eligible voters must travel back to have their say.Although she can’t vote, Murphy wants to go back to Ireland with her husband, who’s from Cork, and their three-year-old daughter but is unsure if the family can afford it.Despite being fervently pro-choice, she can understand arguments on the other side.“I would never talk about a clump of cells because people in my family have gone through miscarriages,” she says. “I totally understand the different feelings towards it and I also think you can make your own choice yourself.”But she feels angry about pro-life lobbyists using children with Down syndrome in their campaigns.When she was pregnant, Murphy was given the choice of receiving a chromosome abnormalities test in Germany but decided against it.“It’s just really insulting to think that if you had the choice then the only choice you would make is to abort all the babies because this is not the case. People will still have kids.”Cora Quigley, from Dublin, moved to Berlin in January last year. The 28 year old’s time abroad is within the 18-month limit so she will fly back to vote and is doing all she can to raise the issue.“I’ve already had a discussion with my mother which went really well,” says Quigley. “It’s important to have conversations in your family because people don’t really talk about it. Even people who appear liberal in other ways might be on the fence.”PhD geography student Lorna O’Hara splits her time between her home city of Dublin and Berlin.The 30 year old, who can vote and will return, has also been having difficult conversations.“It’s hard to look at someone who you love and know their opinion is so different,” says O’Hara. “I’ve been an activist for six years, I know the facts. But when I sat down with my mother all of that flew out the window because you just fall apart.“I think it was the emotion in that conversation that got her to see it from my perspective.”Clíodhna Walsh, a writer from Waterford, says being unable to cast a postal vote is a major disadvantage. “I haven’t found a job yet in Berlin but I’m going to book flights anyway and hope for the best.”O’Hara says her beliefs were shaped by the convent school she attended where the main arguments she heard were against abortion.“A lot of people who are now pro-choice started out being pro-life.If you’re told something as a child you believe it.”As a doula who helps women in pregnancy and abortion, Kilkenny-born Jes Walsh struggles to see things from a pro-choice perspective.The 27 year old, who has been in Berlin for five years and will go back to Ireland to campaign, says: “I don’t see abortion as an act of violence. I see it as violence when you hold people back from their choices.”The group was launched six years ago after the death of Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway due to the complications of a septic miscarriage.“We had quite a few protests outside the Irish Embassy and vigils,” says co-founder Dervla O’Malley, from Galway. “Every year on the anniversary of Savita’s death we hold a vigil.”O’Malley, who has been making sure the event runs smoothly, says the money raised will go to abortion rights and support groups in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.“This referendum is well overdue,” she says. “We’ve waited a long time for this.”Outside, the industrial estate is cold and grey – the opposite of the electric atmosphere among the Irish expats. Physically they are in Berlin.

possibly 90,000 - making it the \u0026quotoldest directly-dated homo sapiens\u0026quot fossil ever found outside of Africa and the Levant.Huw Groucutt, the study’s co-author from the University of Oxford, said its age served as rare evidence that \u0026quotour species was spreading beyond Africa much earlier than previously thought.”It is the first fossil of a hominin - the group of humans and our direct ancestors - discovered in what is Saudi Arabia today.Humans were previously thought to have left Africa in a single wave, moving along the coast from Africa via southern Arabia and India all the way to Australia.But Prof Petraglia said the finger showed \u0026quotthat modern humans were moving across the interior, the terrestrial heart, of Eurasia - not along the coastlines.”The bone was discovered in an area known as Al Wusta that 90,000 years ago would have looked very different to the desert it is today, with plentiful rivers and lakes.It was found with a collection of 380 stone tools nearby, suggesting that groups of tens of humans would have been living at the site.The team also found fossils of various animals, including hippos, as well as advanced stone tools.They said it all pointed to the owner of the finger having been a member of a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer group moving after water and animals.Other archaeological finds, which some have claimed are even older, may very well be authentic but were not directly dated, the researchers said.Most had their age calculated from the sand or rock layers they were found in, or other items in the vicinity.The research is published in the journal Nature Ecology \u0026amp Evolution.Donald Trump says \u0026#39major decision\u0026#39 coming on Syria in next 24-48 hoursSyrian government celebrated after targeting and killing Marie Colvin, defector claimsPrince Albert of Monaco warns of \u0026#39irreversible tragedies\u0026#39 facing world\u0026#39s oceans with up to 500 \u0026#39dead zones\u0026#39Marcella, episode 8 review – this crime drama truly stretched plausibility to its limitFBI raids offices of Donald Trump\u0026#39s lawyerPrivate school parents think they are \u0026#39buying\u0026#39 exam success for their children, teachers\u0026#39 leader says Three Britons including two children injured in Malta tourist bus crashComment: We must learn from past mistakes and act now to stop chemical warfare Comment: Washington is prepared for robust action in Syria and Theresa May must win support to back US alliesMark Zuckerberg admits Facebook \u0026#39didn\u0026#39t do enough\u0026#39 to protect usersOrban to use landslide victory to move against foreign NGOsPolice error meant \u0026#39speeding\u0026#39 motorists paid fines but never exceeded the limitSix park rangers killed in ambush in DRC\u0026#39s famed Virunga gorilla park EU warns fishermen they will need permission to access UK waters in \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit scenario Comment: You may rail against the sugar tax – but this \u0026#39nanny state\u0026#39 levy could help save countless livesSyrian rebels face choice after chemical attack: stay and risk government wrath or leave for opposition area elsewhereStriking French rail workers stage Paris protest as parliament opens debate over crunch reformComment: What\u0026#39s behind the scourge of crack cocaine in Britain?Emmanuel Macron treats Saudi Crown Prince to private dinner at Louvre in latest symbolic gesturePope Francis warns \u0026#39culture of zapping\u0026#39 blocks path to holinessNorth Korea releases young mother caught trying to defect, in unusual move amid diplomatic thaw We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/09/TELEMMGLPICT000159903145_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZHrTyqqLjLkPKjc3TsrXSSooe0IxaCyVBdsVei4rh_Q.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"orban use landslide victory move against foreign ngos","story":"Viktor Orban celebrates on podium on the bank of the Danube River after winning the parliamentary election with members of his FIDESZ party on April 8, 2018 in Budapest.Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party will look capitalise on a crushing election victory last weekend by enacting new laws to curb the rights of civic groups that support refugees, senior party figures said yesterday.The promise to move swiftly against international NGOs highlighted the growing EU isions over Viktor Orban, the controversial Hungarian prime minister, who has repeatedly attacked Brussels for its handling of the 2015 refugee crisis and the imposition of mandatory migrant quotas.As Mr Orban promised to push ahead with reforms, his campaign was criticised as “xenophobic” by official international election monitors yesterday after Mr Orban demonised refugees as “Muslim invaders” and warned of a Jewish conspiracy to dilute Hungary’s Christian identity.The final vote count confirmed Mr Orban had won a 134-seat ‘supermajority’ in Hungary’s 199-seat assembly, opening the door to the so-called “Stop Soros” laws named after George Soros, the billionaire liberal philanthropist, who was targeted in the campaign. The laws are aimed at curbing foreign funding of NGOs.\u0026quotVoters had a wide range of political options, but intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric, media bias and opaque campaign financing constricted the space for genuine political debate,\u0026quot said the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in a preliminary report on the election.Confirmation of 54-year-old Mr Orban’s third term in office drew sharply ided responses across Europe where the Hungarian prime minister is seen in some quarters as a serious threat to liberal democracy.Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the liberal ALDE group in the European Parliament called Mr Orban’s campaing “vile”, attacking Manfred Weber, the head of the conservative EPP grouping, for offering congratulations to Mr Orban.Luxembourg\u0027s foreign minister Jean Asselborn warned that unless big EU countries like France and Germany did more to confront Mr Orban it was storing up trouble for the future.\u0026quotToday it is Hungary and Poland, tomorrow others in eastern and central Europe, even a big founding country of the EU, could develop a taste for undermining values and scaremongering,\u0026quot he said.But despite widespread misgivings about Mr Orban’s growing capture of the Hungarian state through media ownership and other changes to the law, the Hungarian leader’s victory was acknowledged by the major western EU powers.Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, sent “congratulations” adding that the UK looked forward to “working with our Hungarian friends”.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said Germany would be a “reliable partner” to Hungary, despite differences on migration, a spokesman said. France said it would continue to pursue “political dialogue in the service of the European project and its values\u0026quot.The European Commission was more guarded. Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commission president, was scheduled to call Mr Orban while noting that the EU was a “union of democracies” whose values needed to defended by all member states “without exception”, his spokesman said.Populist leaders across Europe hailed Mr Orban’s victory, including France’s Marine Le Pen, Italy’s Matteo Salvini, the Netherlands’ Geert Wilders and Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, who said the Hungarian leader was the “EU’s biggest nightmare”.Regional analysts said that EU leaders had little choice but to work with Mr Orban, even though his increasingly autocratic approach to government was undermining attempts to reunite the EU club after Brexit.The strong showing of populist parties in last month’s Italian elections and Poland’s hardline conservative government would provide further a drag on the project, added Mujtaba Rahman, the head of practice at the Eurasia Group risk consultancy.“This result is a big negative for Macron and Merkel’s desire to reform Europe and heal tensions between the West and East Europeans,” he said. “Alongside Poland and Italy,  there are now three very significant anti-establishment players at the EU’s top table.”Donald Trump says \u0026#39major decision\u0026#39 coming on Syria in next 24-48 hoursSyrian government celebrated after targeting and killing Marie Colvin, defector claimsPrince
