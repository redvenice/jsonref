[{"url":null,"title":"Study mouthwash reduce spread Covid 19","story":"Share this article Jerry Randall, chief executive of Venture Life, Dentyl\u0027s parent company, said: \u0027We are excited at the prospect that this long-standing, well-known mouthwash product could help in the fight against Covid-19.\u0027The launch of the study comes after a group of scientists in May called for urgent research into the use of readily available mouthwash to reduce the spread of the virus.Publishing their review in the Function journal, the authors wrote: \u0027We highlight that already published research on other enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, directly supports the idea that further research is needed on whether oral rinsing could be considered as a potential way to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\u0027Lead author Professor Valerie O\u0027Donnell, co-director of Cardiff University\u0027s Systems Immunity Research Institute, said at the time: \u0027Safe use of mouthwash – as in gargling – has so far not been considered by public health bodies in the UK.\u0027She added: \u0027This is an under-researched area of major clinical need – and we hope that research projects will be quickly mobilised to further evaluate this.\u0027The completed research will be peer reviewed before it is published in around six months\u0027 time.It comes after experts last month claimed iodine mouthwash could destroy Covid-19 and prevent or reduce its effects if someone is already sick.Researchers at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain said the specific type of mouthwash can have \u0027significant virucidal activity\u0027. Testing on a small group of patients with Covid-19, they found using the mouthwash reduced the number of viruses that were in their saliva.Lower viral loads — the number of viruses circulating through the body — have been linked to milder symptoms and faster recovery.Iodine mouthwash is stronger than popular shop-bought products such as Listerine or Colgate, which typically don\u0027t contain the antiseptic chemical.Instead, they are more commonly used by dentists. One brand that contains iodine is Betadine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ddcb77cfec3daa91ecedf50ac652b795a233c5/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=387ad550e04962a4b47823f99bce65dc","title":"the tyranny of chairs","story":"Most chairs aren’t designed to serve human bodies – but a better seat is possible. By  Sara Hendren‘Let’s face the considerable evidence that all sitting is harmful,” writes Galen Cranz, a design historian whose book The Chair traces this object’s long history. Not all sitting, of course. For people who use wheelchairs, they’re an elegant and crucial technology. And sitting itself is not the culprit any unchanging, repetitive motion or posture fails to give the body the variation it needs. But Cranz, writing primarily for an audience of ambulatory readers in industrialised and therefore sedentary societies, is one of many researchers who have been saying for decades that chairs are a major cause of pain and disability.Sitting for hours and hours can weaken your back and core muscles, pinch the nerves of your rear end and constrain the flow of blood that your body needs for peak energy and attention. Most people’s bodies are largely unsuited to extended periods in these structures. Extensive research confirms that sitting in chairs is correlated, Cranz notes, with “back pain of all sorts, fatigue, varicose veins, stress and problems with the diaphragm, circulation, digestion, elimination and general body development”. There is growing evidence that relentlessly sedentary jobs – in some, such as bus driving and forklift operating, bodies are literally strapped to chairs – are harmful enough to shorten life expectancy.For most of human history, a mix of postures was the norm for a body meeting the world. Squatting has been as natural a posture as sitting for daily tasks, and lying down was a conventional pose for eating in some ancient cultures. So why has sitting in chairs persisted in so many modern cultures? As with all material objects, Cranz reminds us, function tells only part of the story. The other part, always, is culture – the inherited and sometimes arbitrary ways that things have always been done, and therefore continue as common practice. “Biology, physiology and anatomy have less to do with our chairs than pharaohs, kings and executives,” she writes.One kind of historical chair, called the “klismos” by historians, developed primarily as a historical expression of status. Setting a body higher than and apart from other people, in an inidual structure with rigid, flat planes – a throne, if you will – evolved as a way of recognising an inidual’s power, with the earliest known models dating to ancient Egypt and south-eastern Europe. Their use as an expression of authority continued throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and the endurance of this symbolism lives on as metaphor in many contemporary leadership titles to chair the committee or the department, or to sit in the designated “director’s chair” on a film set, is still to hold a seat of power.In the centuries prior to western industrialisation, stools or benches were common household furnishings, but chairs were special-occasion objects, usually the exclusive property of the wealthy and powerful. The era of mass manufacturing in the 19th century, and the rapid social and economic changes that came with it, brought chairs into daily life for the first time. Industrial jobs, with their repetitive tasks, required a seated posture, and the high demand for chairs that this created in turn made them available and affordable to middle-class people in Europe and the US.“Chair-and-table culture,” Cranz writes, has become fully entrenched in many parts of the world since then. Modern interior designers have done their part to perpetuate chairs as a fashionable and practical norm, reinventing the form again and again in its aesthetics, though not nearly enough in its ergonomics. Chairs are four-legged creatures with anatomical backs and bottoms, familiar to humans because they stand up, almost like animals, beckoning us with their lifelike structures to sit down. Cranz notes that they appeal to humans, and perhaps especially designers, with this blend of the “architectonic and the anthropomorphic”: they are structurally interesting and an echo of the body itself.But while they remind us of the human form, chairs rarely do much to actually support it. For instance, many chair designs feature big, soft cushions that seem to indicate comfort, but in ergonomics, the consensus contradicts this padded aesthetic. Cranz writes that “an overpadded chair forces the sit bones to rock in the padding rather than make contact with a stable surface, thereby forcing the flesh in the butt and thighs to bear weight”.How can a nice cushioned chair that screams comfort be so ill-suited to most actual bodies? The real science of ergonomics, Cranz argues, should point designers toward chair design that supports and enables the body’s need for movement, not stillness – with seats that angle downward in front, for example, and have a base that’s flexible enough for the sitter to shift their body weight from leg to leg. But for the most part, these principles are ignored in favour of fashion and cheap manufacturing.Chairs are generally not a response to the realities of the body, its natural evolution, or its needs over any extended period. Instead, the industrialised body has devolved in its needs and succumbed to chairs. “We design them,” Cranz writes, repurposing a famous line of Winston Churchill’s, “but once built, they shape us.”Naturally, there have been plenty of attempts by designers to reinvent sitting. There are kneeling chairs, bouncing balls, perch-style stools with rounded bottoms to encourage shifts in weight and movement. There are flexibly designed chairs such as the Tripp Trapp for children, with pegs for adjusting the seat and leg supports to grow with a young body. Some offices have started to introduce standing desks. But at the average restaurant, in the ordinary classroom, and on trains, buses and aeroplanes, you’ll still find chairs that are mostly at odds with any idea of comfort.It’s not just chairs, of course – so many of the products brought to market by the profession of industrial design were not created for many bodies. Instead, they were designed to be plentiful, novel rather than necessary, and cheap. One famous designer, Victor Papanek, memorably dubbed these bad designs a form of “do-it-yourself murder”.“Never before in history have grown men sat down and seriously designed electric hairbrushes, rhinestone-covered file boxes, and mink carpeting for bathrooms, and then drawn up elaborate plans to make and sell the gadgets to millions of people,” he wrote in 1971. “Today, industrial design has put murder on a mass-production basis. By designing criminally unsafe automobiles that kill or maim nearly 1 million people around the world each year, by creating whole new species of permanent garbage to clutter up the landscape, and by choosing materials and processes that pollute the air we breathe, designers have become a dangerous breed.”Papanek was calling out his entire profession when he wrote these words. Design for the Real World, his first book, was a fiercely argued polemic about the misguided operations of industrial design in the mid-20th century, a call for designers to question what Papanek witheringly referred to as “shroud design” – a preoccupation with the way things look on the outside, at the expense of how they should function and how robustly and sustainably they are made. He understood how the products with which we navigate daily life match (or fail to match) the bodies and tasks they are meant to conjoin as tools. He likened his peers’ shirking of their responsibilities to “what would happen if all medical doctors were to forsake general practice and surgery, and concentrate exclusively on dermatology and cosmetics”.Papanek was responding to the heady early days of truly mass manufacturing in the aftermath of the second world war, when supply chains expanded to previously unimaginable scale, fuelled by an equally huge advertising industry. Papanek understood the job of product design to be an ambitious one – to “transform man’s environment and tools and, by extension, man himself” – but he saw in the giddiness of postwar growth a moment when designers lost their way. An overwhelming cultural belief and investment in technology created a cultural appetite for whatever seemed shiny and new, and the industry now pandered to it.The public’s ready acceptance of these shiny new objects, whose life was meant to last only until the next new thing arrived, created an allegiance among designers to what Papanek called “the dark twins of styling and obsolescence”. Manufacturing for styling, amplified by advertising, resulted in an empty desire for unnecessary objects that became quickly unusable. And objects that were created purely for ephemeral desire, in turn, created a whole ethos of obsolescence – an accepted disposability that made for a dangerous neglect of safety standards, resulting in needless injury from common household objects. At the time of his writing, he claimed that 600 women annually lost a hand in injuries brought about by top-loading washing machines. When operating at its worst, design resulted in needless injury, but in its everyday mediocrity it also created conditions where objects were not in harmony with the needs of the people for whom they were designed.As Papanek observed, there is a wide gulf between the people who use TV remotes, car dashboards and other everyday items, and the people who make the design decisions that bring those items into being, who are driven or constrained by motives other than ease of use. The bodiedness of people gets lost, especially in the sedentary workplace, where human labour is imagined not as flesh and muscles, but as measurable economic deliverables, organised by roles and tasks. Yet the work is carried out by bodies all the same, not just in chairs, but among the angular shapes of desks and copiers and countertops, alongside mechanical and digital machines. The passive as well as active physical requirements of our workdays tax our bodies, whether we bend repeatedly to harvest berries or sit still in a phone bank for hours on end.Post-Papanek, designers continued to wrestle with the conundrum of chairs. In the late 70s, the office furniture giant Herman Miller commissioned independent designers Bill Stumpf and Don Chadwick to look for opportunities in the furniture market, gaps that new products might fill and thereby expand the company’s market share. In the course of their research, Stumpf and Chadwick, seasoned observers of humans and designed environments, noted one particular context in which chairs were creatively adapted but ill-suited to their sitters: older adults who spent a lot of their day sitting in La-Z-Boy recliners, watching TV or doing otherwise passive activities.They noted that the recliner had even become a makeshift medical treatment chair they witnessed it being used, for example, in a half-reclined state for people undergoing dialysis treatment. Despite the advantages of its variability in pitch and support structures, however, it was the wrong chair for many of the conditions that come with ageing. Older adults with weakened muscles had trouble getting in and out or reaching the lever for changing positions, and the deep padding, used for its presumed comfort, put people who sat for long periods at risk of bedsores.Inspired by the spirit of the recliner, Stumpf and Chadwick reconsidered all of its traditional features and generated a prototype called the Sarah chair , which they pitched to Herman Miller in 1988. It had all the flexibility of a recliner and more – multiple ways to choose the pitch of the back, seat and arms, and a flexible footrest for changing positions more easily. They reduced the padding significantly, making a thinner and more breathable seat structure. The model was popular in-house as a chair with purpose – many Herman Miller staff could imagine it being useful for their grandparents, for example. But the mass-market appeal wasn’t obvious at first, and the firm rejected the Sarah in its first iteration, only to revive the design a few years later.For the second version, Stumpf and Chadwick imagined the ergonomic features of the chair with ageing still in mind, but also the body of the average office worker, commonly tethered for long stretches to a personal computer and keyboard. They got rid of the foam padding altogether, making the model’s signature new aesthetic a cushionless seat of thick plastic webbing that would support the shapes of any body, not just an ageing one. The Aeron was a wild success, quickly taken up as a status symbol in high-end office environments like those in Silicon Valley.Aeron chairs have become a canonical, if expensive, example of what’s called “universal” design and its variants, barrier-free and inclusive design. This principle is what many people think of when they hear the words “disability” and “design” together. The logic of universalism goes like this: designers gain surprising and powerful insights from looking closely not at norms and averages – not at people whose experiences fall well inside the expected middle of a curve – but instead at people and scenarios at the margins of experience, so-called extreme users. Good designers, the thinking goes, will take a close look at unusual circumstances, places where products (or environments, or services) are full of friction for people with particular needs. There, in the margins of human experience, are clues to suboptimal conditions that may also affect people in the normative middle, though perhaps to a lesser degree.In the case of disability, that would mean closely observing older adults and wheelchair users, and people on the autism spectrum, say, and then abstracting from those observations. What is working for these people, and what isn’t, based on what they say or do, or what they don’t say or do? Where might improvements be introduced to address those points of friction at the margins, the places where design isn’t working? After a series of prototypes and testing, the process aims to make a more user-friendly, ergonomic, accessible product (or service, or environment) for all – in principle, at least, design “for everyone”.It wasn’t Papanek who offered universal design to the world it was disabled people whose long-held insights generated what became a set of principles that designers could follow. Ronald Mace, a wheelchair user and architect, is credited with introducing the term “universal design” to the public in 1985. In part, the coinage was strategic, recasting features of design that had been considered “special” as simply good design, resulting in products and buildings that were straightforwardly “usable by all people”.The universal design principles that Mace and others in the disability community generated read like an antidote not only to the preoccupation with “styling and obsolescence” that Papanek called out, but also to the “murderous” results of negligent design they include principles such as “simple and intuitive use”, “perceptible information”, “low physical effort”, and perhaps most important of all, “tolerance for error”.Universal design isn’t restricted to high-end items such as the Aeron chair. If you go looking for kitchen tools in your average store, for example, you’ll easily find the Oxo Good Grips line, with the familiar thick black pliable rubber handles that have just enough give to hold comfortably, and just enough sturdy resistance to offer leverage. The brand began with a vegetable peeler, an object so everyday as to be invisible – and that peeler originated, as design often does, in a complaint that inspired an idea.In the late 80s, a woman named Betsey Farber was attempting to use a standard metal vegetable peeler in the holiday house she was renting with her husband, Sam, a retired entrepreneur. The tool was frustrating to use, especially because Betsey had arthritis. So, right there in the kitchen, Sam and Betsey started to sketch out ideas for a new version of a peeler. With further refinement, those ideas resulted in the now-ubiquitous Oxo design: fins on the sides elegantly indicate the place to put your thumb in order to optimise the mechanics of use, a visual cue for intuitive handling. When you hold the peeler against a carrot, it encourages you to apply just enough pressure to catch a ribbon of skin without cutting too deeply, and without a reckless amount of slip that would send both carrot and peeler flying from your hands.Sam Farber came out of retirement and went to work on the peeler, and the idea that he and Betsey hatched was taken up in a partnership with a product design firm that went on to create the Good Grips line: can openers, salad tongs and other tools made for the subtle work of manual kitchen tasks. Thus went a now-classic universal design success story, which has taken its place in the canon alongside that of the Aeron chair, as inspiration to a generation of would-be practitioners.There are other stories besides. Designer Marc Harrison was commissioned by Cuisinart in the late 70s to overhaul its commercial-grade food processor into a more consumer-friendly domestic model. The company didn’t ask Harrison to address disability as a use case for its product, but Harrison’s research and teaching at Rhode Island School of Design had included years of collaborative work on furniture for rehabilitation settings and wheelchair-accessible housing. Those experiences nourished the insights Harrison brought to the processor. He introduced things such as large-print, high-contrast lettering for the labels, and controls that flipped like paddles rather than requiring fiddly turning. These and other features were informed by usability principles Harrison had learned from looking closely at disability. This kind of commitment and imagination in design yields products and experiences that can make life better without you even noticing it.Disability is the little-acknowledged heart of the innovation in many digital tools, too. The history of the telephone, for example, is tightly bound up with research on deafness. Alexander Graham Bell’s work with deaf students and their teachers solidified his research on making speech visible, reducible to signals and therefore transmittable by electronic means. That research made telephone technology possible, but it also helped set in motion the standardisation of signal processing that was crucial to early computing.In the US, perhaps the most hidden-in-plain-sight of examples of these innovations is the landmark change to media consumption that happened after disability activists fought for closed-captioning technology to be built into every standard television. The Television Decoder Circuitry Act, passed in the US in 1990, required the technology to be a standard part of the television manufacturing process, rather than an extra device attached alongside it. The battle to pass the legislation was difficult and protracted, in the face of resistance from within the communications industry about the perceived extra expense it would entail. But thanks to the economy of scale created by the legislation, the cost of adding this capacity to televisions is now so small that it is almost impossible to calculate. Meanwhile, closed captioning has become a standard feature of daily life. It’s how you follow along with sports matches across a restaurant or airport terminal, and it’s how you understand clips from an election debate on your laptop with the sound off, making it possible to multitask when your kids are in the next room trying to get to sleep.It would be easy to conclude from these stories that universal design is dispatching “murderous” objects to the dustbin of history, and that it alone points the way to a more accessible future. Designing ergonomic objects that can be mass-produced and affordable enough to find their way into the hands of people who need them is an unassailable good. But disability scholars also point to the ironies created by the work that Mace and his ilk set in motion. One is that while the dominant model of universal design has disability at its centre, the very success of the innovations it generates tends to obscure their origin stories, as in the case of the Oxo peeler. That success makes many people overlook the barriers that still exist to an adaptive, flexible world for disabled people. Universal design also tends to stoke an unquestioned faith in the importance of products, attained by consumers, as the key to building a desirable world. A better product might be useful in the short term, but sometimes it’s a better process, or a better system, that’s needed to provide a long-term solution.Take, for example, the Leveraged Freedom Chair, a design created with paraplegic wheelchair users in parts of the world where accessible streets are rare. Amos Winter, director of the Global Engineering and Research Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), did years of trial-and-error field research with his team in Tanzania, Guatemala and India, in order to collaboratively design a chair with variable torque in driving, even in off-road terrain, using very simple technology. Depending on where you grab one of its extended handles, you get more or less mechanical advantage, just like switching gears on a bicycle, which makes uneven pavement or dirt roads much more navigable. A third wheel in front adds balance. “We failed a number of times,” Winter has said. The design process “has to start and end with end users”, he says. “These are the people who have to define the requirements of the technology, and give it the thumbs-up at the end.”Getting the seat, frame and handles in the right positions to be both comfortable and advantageous in their physics was an engineer’s task of very fine designing and building. But the real ingenuity isn’t in the mechanics it’s in the sustainable system for repair and maintenance. Many wheelchair companies make their chairs with their own proprietary parts, so even if they donate free chairs to people who need them, the parts are expensive to replace, and the chairs become unusable when they break. If a wheelchair is going to last in a rural area among populations who aren’t rich, says Winter, “it has to be repairable using the local tools, materials and knowledge in those contexts”. The Freedom Chair was made of globally standardised and affordable bicycle parts, so they can be repaired and replaced anywhere in the world.“To make something cheap and simple and reliable often takes rigorous engineering,” says Winter. “What is the solution that will give you the required performance for as little money and as little complexity as possible?” The Leveraged Freedom Chair was not a compromise it wasn’t a chair that was “good enough” for the people who use it. It was the right design for specific people in specific contexts, and it was designed to last. • Adapted from What Can a Body Do?

Back on Earth, she says, it was hard to find authentic relationshipsThere’s something surreal about talking to someone who’s been to space. Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti might be at home in Cologne while I’m Zooming her from London – but there’s still an awareness: those eyes have seen what only a handful of people will ever see. Those hands have been without gravity travelling at 28,000 kilometres an hour.Loved ones gave Cristoforetti trinkets to take to the space station, where she spent 200 days between November 2014 and June 2015. The way she sees it, the rationale is that not many things have ever been to space and “you’re going to see a picture of it floating in front of Earth – it’s a symbolic meaning, added value”.Aware of the distance space travel can create between astronauts and earthlings, in Cristoforetti’s new book, Diary of an Apprentice Astronaut, she worries about the impact that having been to space might have on her life – “as if it weren’t already hard enough, even without the traps of celebrity, to lead a centred, virtuous life”. The idea of minor celebrity is, she concedes, against a neat backdrop of filing cabinets, “a bit scary, yes. People look at you in a different way. It’s less natural and so I find it difficult nowadays to find relationships I feel are authentic.”But life in space is also full of the humdrum. On weekends, Cristoforetti would hoover. She would still need haircuts and enjoy the throaty singing of Italian crooner Paolo Conte. Episodes of Battlestar Galactica would be used as a distraction from time spent running, harnessed to a treadmill.Her book is full of these quotidian quirks. Even the years spent in training are shown in all their pedestrian glory: the Harry Potter audiobooks listened to in Russian for language practice (she still has “a small, but enviable vocabulary of Russian magical terms”), the fretting over the best face moisturiser to take, and her out of office: “I’ll be off the planet for a while, back in May 2015. Unfortunately I won’t read your message.”But unlike on Earth, in space “you go from the total mundane to the sublime in the split of a second,” she says. Chores are interrupted by the sight of an aurora borealis and unfulfilling showers – there is no running water – are set against a backdrop of the “Earth gliding past the large windows”.Her time on the space station was saturated with awe: views of Earth take in 2,000 kilometres in all directions, dawns see the world tinted blue and red, cyclones wreaking havoc below appear as pictures of “quiet strength” from above. Whenever Cristoforetti could, she used to take in views of the Namibian desert, the indigo and emerald Caribbean and uninhabited atolls, and she describes how her eyes were “saturated with sublime beauty, steeped in the splendour of the stars”.The 43-year-old astronaut, who was formerly in the Italian air force, is often asked what impact these sights have had. While the book is full of illuminating observations from what she calls the “cosmic perspective”, “I resist this expectation people have sometimes that you go to space and come back with a new view of life.” In lieu of great epiphanies, Cristoforetti says, “you may catch a glimpse of insight”, plus it “intensifies your sensibility to things that you’re probably very sensible to anyway”.I do, however, ask if it gave her any insight into the current rub between internationalism and nationalism – so much of the book is an exercise in cooperation between scientists in the US and Russia, and she writes of the paradox of feeling connected to Europe when she is floating above the Earth in its entirety. Especially given that, as she puts it, from space differences of “culture, history, habit, material conditions” shrink down to details when compared to the “underlying substance, that kernel of human nature made up of feeling hot and cold, being hungry and thirsty, experiencing joy, pain, fear, wonder and ecstasy”.“When I was up there especially, more than I do now,” she says, “I felt this connection with humanity as a whole.” But, she adds, “that did not prevent me from realising, recognising, honouring that I do come from somewhere.” Equally, she never regarded these two perspectives as being in conflict.“I think that there is a lack of mutual trust between these two sets of people, those who are more international, maybe more urban in lifestyle, and then people who are more tied to local customs, traditions, language … It’s not such a dramatic conflict that we have to make it some kind of civil war … I hope that we move past this moment,” she says.Much was made of the fact that Cristoforetti is a woman – the first female Italian astronaut in space. For the public, she says, “it is a huge deal, especially for young girls and women”. Speaking to her, I remember the excitement of the first British astronaut Helen Sharman visiting my school. No doubt many children will remember Cristoforetti visiting theirs.Ninety per cent of astronauts have been men. There has even been a Barbie crafted in Cristoforetti’s likeness, a bid to encourage more girls to explore a future in science. But Cristoforetti is understandably reluctant to let her gender become too much of the focus. While in the book she concedes that “I have probably experienced discrimination that was subtle enough to have been ambiguous”, she says that pulling on the EMU suits used for spacewalking, which are not designed for the average-sized woman, was the only time she had encountered an obstacle “clearly linked to my being a woman”.There are other instances, but Cristoforetti obviously doesn’t see them as barriers. In one exchange a journalist asks her “in all apparent seriousness how it felt to be going into space with two such attractive men, whose strong shoulders I could lean on”. “That was laughing material for a long time,” she says, laughing again.There are upsides, namely the community who meet and party at ladies’ astronaut night, which she tells me is, beyond the guest list, no different from your average party – “just getting together with some finger food and drinks and chat”. She sought advice from veterans on the best bra to wear in orbit (a bra camisole for daily activities) as well as how best to approach peeing in space. Not a single female colleague had found the special funnel designed for women to be better than the regular version.Astronauts’ lives are full of firsts, opportunities to experience new feelings or do hitherto unperformed tasks – Cristoforetti was the first person to make an espresso in space, for instance. But the most noteworthy of those new feelings is, surely, weightlessness. This experience of feeling “completely unknown sensations”, she says, is part of what those who become astronauts are seeking.Does she miss it? “I do, yeah. I miss that feeling of lightness.” But the feeling she is speaking of seems to go further than a physical lightness. “I really enjoyed life up there. It’s a very simple, fulfilling life, with a lot of purpose in everything that you do.” Her days on the space station were peppered with scientific experiments, taking saliva or blood samples so that scientists back on earth could learn about the impact of x or y on humans. It’s a setup that makes life in space unavoidably meaningful.Coming back is, she says, the hardest part. “The six months after, when you’re still wrapping up the mission … you’re back but you’re not done.” While she writes of feeling at home even as she is about to take off, the “undeniable risk of a sudden and violent death tonight” looming, what she refers to as “ordinary life” is clearly the scary part: “The fact you have to grocery shop, sit in traffic, all those things that you just don’t have up there, cook your food – it’s not just a packet where you add some water and it’s ready.”• Diary of an Apprentice Astronaut by Samantha Cristoforetti is published on 27 August by Allen Lane."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8f67852308c995d582d6b10e265a3b41ebbd9b2/332_1017_6653_3992/master/6653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75dfe0b379ae3a8f1e227fd78307b934","title":"uk post lockdown sofa sales surge says dfs","story":"Post-lockdown sales of sofas have surged at the retailer DFS Furniture, as people bought new furnishings after months confined to their homes.“The thing that has been a pleasant surprise for us has been that people seem to be switching their spend into home as opposed to holidays, or leisure, or fashion,” said the DFS chief executive, Tim Stacey.Demand for made-to-order sofas has led to longer waiting times, which have increased from an average of 4-6 weeks usually seen as this time of year to 11-12 weeks.“We have 1,000 people in the UK making sofas every day and we are flat out at the moment,” said Stacey.

Judging from the 15 years it took before a UN-appointed tribunal basically admitted its impotence on the latter event, there won’t be any official certainty about the circumstances of the terrible explosion at Beirut’s port in the foreseeable future. A few conclusions can, however. be drawn about this highly traumatic tragedy.The first is that, notwithstanding the blast’s particular circumstances, the responsibility for leaving 2,750  tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate warehoused in the heart of Beirut for no less than six years falls on the whole Lebanese ruling class – all those who have been in the Lebanese government during that period. Presidents, prime ministers, ministers of transport, chiefs of key security apparatuses and port administrators are all equally to blame. The list includes leaders of both the official Lebanese state and the parallel state constituted by Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is known to closely monitor Beirut’s airport and port and use them at its will.How did Lebanon get to this point? We need to take in 30 years of political and economic misrule to understand. Before 1975, when the civil war started, Lebanon was known to be a “fiscal paradise”: a country of wild capitalism, whose bank secrecy and sham taxation made it an ideal territory for money laundering, capital flight and all sorts of trafficking. The war ended with a political and constitutional agreement between Lebanese factions achieved in 1989 under the joint auspices of the Saudi monarchy and the Syrian regime. It was confirmed the year after by the latter’s participation in the US-led coalition that waged the first international war on Iraq from Saudi territory.During a dozen years, Lebanon was run by this Saudi-Syrian entente: representing the Saudi side, Rafik Hariri closely coordinated with Ghazi Kanaan, the all-powerful head of Syria’s security apparatus in Lebanon. Damascus’s opposition to the second US-led war on Iraq and the occupation of that country in 2003 led to the end of the entente. Washington started exerting pressure to expel Syrian troops from Lebanon, notably by sponsoring UN security council resolution 1559 of 2004 (Russia and China abstained in order not to veto it).Hariri’s assassination triggered a huge outpouring of popular anger, compelling Damascus to withdraw its troops. It kept pulling strings in Lebanon nevertheless, through a triple alliance composed of its close ally Amal, the Shia sectarian movement led by Nabih Berri, the Lebanese parliament’s speaker for life (he assumed office in 1992) Hezbollah, the Lebanese agent of Iran, Syria’s regional ally and Michel Aoun, Syria’s former bitter foe who about-turned in 2006.Over the past 15 years, Lebanon has basically been run by a renewed joint government, involving Rafik Hariri’s son Saad and the triple alliance, and continuing a disastrous economic policy of neoliberal reconstruction that had been in place since the end of the war. However, the war that unfolded in Syria since the 2011 Arab spring has considerably weakened Damascus and increased the role of Tehran and its Lebanese representative, as Iran gained the upper hand over Syria itself. This shift in the regional balance of forces translated into the election of Aoun as president in 2016. The botched attempt by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to twist Saad Hariri’s arm into ending collaboration with Tehran’s followers in 2017 was a clumsy reaction to this turn of events. In any event, the responsibility for the Lebanese economy’s collapse falls squarely on the whole spectrum of the country’s ruling class, all those who held offices over the past 30 years, as much as it falls on the banking sector with which they have all been enmeshed. Riad Salamé, the governor of Lebanon’s Central Bank since 1992 and still in place, embodies these entrenched problems. This shared responsibility was addressed by the now famous central slogan of the popular uprising that began on 17 October last year: “All of them means all of them.”With popular anger reaching a climax because of Beirut’s recent blast, there has been much hope in Lebanon for a silver lining to the tragedy in imposing two key demands of the October uprising on the ruling class: a government truly independent from it and new elections on the basis of a new electoral law. The expectation was that international pressure would force the implementation of these demands and provide a counterweight to the local ruling class.Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Beirut two days after the blast brought this expectation to a peak. Here was a leader who dared to mingle with the people right after the disaster, many thought, overlooking that it was a great photo-op for a French president beleaguered in his own country. The expectation did not last: Macron’s consistent line regarding the Middle East has been to mediate between the US and Iran (where French capitalist stakes are high), as he did when he attempted to organise a meeting between Donald Trump and Iran’s foreign minister on the margin of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4f43d71cd59b79cb137ea6230246b32b9d0c6ce/0_63_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e35c7af1fc816d86a700723d487d126c","title":"why are harrys and meghans freebies in the spotlight two words prince andrew","story":"It’s cheap to be rich, and expensive to be poor.

I’m not sure what the technical term for this phenomenon is. Capitalism, perhaps? Trickle-up economics? Whatever it is called, Harry and Meghan are prime examples of it in action: the Sussexes have reportedly received more than £3.5m in gifts since they got together. According to Finding Freedom, a headline-grabbing biography of the couple, billionaire buddies have loaned them private jets and palatial homes while publicity-hungry brands have thrown merchandise at them. Diptyque, the purveyor of posh candles, apparently gave the couple several pricey diffusers for their wedding – because St George’s Chapel can get a little musty.I’m not here to give Harry and Meghan a hard time: I couldn’t care less how many complimentary candles the couple have managed to wangle. Far better to be known as the “prince of handouts” than the “handsy prince”, after all. Being cheap isn’t necessarily problematic being friends with a sex offender most certainly is. Indeed, a cynic might wonder whether one of the reasons Harry and Meghan are constantly in the news is to keep the spotlight off Prince Andrew.That said, the Sussexes’ swag serves as an infuriating reminder that handouts and discounts are par for the course when you’re wealthy: it’s cheap to be rich and it’s expensive to be poor. The less money you have, the more everyday life tends to cost a 2016 University of Bristol study found the average annual “poverty premium” on essential goods and services for a low-income household is £490. Poor or erratic earnings can prevent you paying bills by monthly direct debit so you are forced to pay extra for prepay you are cut off from the best borrowing rates you have to pay higher insurance rates because you live in a low-income area you can’t afford to buy in bulk so you pay more for things like toilet paper. The poverty premium is everywhere, and it adds up quickly.I don’t know what kind of credit cards the Sussexes have and something tells me they probably don’t need the perks. Nevertheless, I wish the golden couple the best of luck as they work to become “financially independent”.

We must not hide anything. Healing is knowledge.”The decision had been taken partly as a result of the Black Lives Matter movement, the museum’s curators said. Protests against racial inequality broke out around the world following the death of George Floyd in the US in May.Sloane – a physician born in Ireland in 1660 – partly funded his collection from enslaved labour on Jamaican sugar plantations. His artefacts provided the starting point for what became the British Museum.Fischer said: “Dedication to truthfulness when it comes to history is absolutely crucial, with the aim to rewrite our shared, complicated and, at times, very painful history.“The case dedicated to Hans Sloane and his relationship to slavery is a very important step in this. We have pushed him off the pedestal where nobody looked at him, and placed him in the limelight.“The British Museum has done a lot of work – accelerated and enlarged its work on its own history, the history of empire, the history of colonialism, and also of slavery. These are subjects which need to be addressed, and to be addressed properly. We need to understand our own history.”Sloane, who married a wealthy sugar plantation heiress, is honoured by numerous place names, including London’s Sloane Square.The British Museum’s demotion of its founding father is part of a wider reckoning over race triggered by Floyd’s death.In June, protesters in Bristol toppled the statue of the 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston while campaigners have reignited their calls to remove the Cecil Rhodes statue from outside an Oxford college."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4651a15daed88a0c322073480f45fcff79aa065/0_436_2284_1370/master/2284.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=257ecf1d5f3f37747ca5031dde79199e","title":"ofqual head sally collier resigns over exams fiasco","story":"Exams regulator chief, who oversaw development of flawed algorithm, steps downThe head of England’s exam regulator, Sally Collier, has resigned over the exams fiasco that has engulfed schools and universities.She had been conspicuous by her absence since the U-turn on results last week, with Ofqual’s chair, Roger Taylor, issuing a public apology instead.Ofqual said she would be replaced temporarily by her predecessor Dame Glenys Stacey.Collier’s resignation comes days after the publication of millions of GCSE results and a day after Gavin Williamson insisted Ofqual had his “full confidence”.

Its embassy in Ecuador declared a “zero tolerance” policy towards illegal fishing, and this week it announced it was tightening the rules for its enormous flotilla with a series of new regulations.But with 325 of those 340 ships remaining off Ecuador, and local navy commander Darwin Jarrín saying last week that nearly half of those vessels had intermittently switched off their satellite communications – breaching the rules of the regional fisheries management organisation – the episode has shown how difficult it is for small nations to stand up to China’s distant fleet even when it descends on the archipelago that inspired Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution.China’s vast fishing fleet, by far the world’s largest, has been overfishing seas much further from the world’s gaze than the islands known for their giant tortoises and iguanas. From West Africa’s Gulf of Guinea to the Korean peninsula, the fleet has moved into the waters of other countries – switching off transponders to avoid detection, depleting fish stocks and threatening food security for often poor coastal communities. In east Asia, fishing vessels may act as the vanguard of an aggressive geopolitical strategy aimed at asserting territorial claims.China’s new regulations this week include harsher penalties for companies and captains involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated – or IUU – fishing. But conservationists monitoring the Galápagos episode are sceptical.“Beyond this one-sided announcement, the problem remains the same,” says Pablo Guerrero, marine conservation director for WWF Ecuador. “These boats operate without observers on board, they do not return to port, they transship their catch to mother vessels, which land the catch at ports. So, in a nutshell, they are fishing all the time, the fishing operation doesn’t stop.”The fleet is a vast and complex network. Among the hundreds of vessels are fuel providers, fishing boats, tender boats and reefers, some of which camouflage unregistered boats, Guerrero says. Many ships spend long periods at sea where shocking human rights violations have been reported.NGO Global Fishing Watch and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) thinktank have used cutting-edge technology and data analysis to reveal that the size and scope of China’s distant-water fleet has been hugely underreported.The ODI found the fleet had 16,966 vessels, five times more than previous estimates. By contrast, the US distant-water fleet comprises 300 boats.In 2017, as part of its 13th fisheries five-year plan, China announced plans to cap the size of the fleet to 3,000 vessels by 2020.“We were shocked by the results because we were expecting 4,000 or 5,000 vessels,” says Miren Gutiérrez, the lead author of the ODI report.The research, which took more than a year, also found nearly 1,000 of the boats were using “flags of convenience” and at least 183 vessels were involved in suspected IUU fishing, for which China ranked the worst-performing nation in a 2019 global index.A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner’s own.For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes.For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers\u0027 Federation.Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an “open registry”, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account.The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition.“Most of this overfishing is not illegal, that’s the problem,” Gutiérrez says, as most of it goes on in international waters. Most of the fleet’s vessels are trawlers – banned within China’s territorial waters and notorious for damaging  ecosystems by dragging nets along the seafloor. Other common boats are longliners, for larger fish such as tuna or shark, and squid-jiggers, which usually operate in deeper waters.China’s self-declared shake-up proposes changes to high-seas transshipment rules – the movement of cargo from one vessel to another – along with reforms to distant-water fishing. It also announced two three-month fishing moratoriums: one west of the Galápagos, between September and November, and another beginning in July in the south Atlantic near Argentina.The world’s biggest seafood exporter is also mooted to be planning to ratify the Port State Measures Agreement, the first internationally binding accord in which ports around the world pledge not to allow illegal or unregulated fishing boats to land catches.“It’s a significant concession,” says Steve Trent, executive director of the Environmental Justice Foundation. “But in the context of global fisheries it’s not enough, it’s not nearly enough.”Ecuador is one of a few small nation states that have pushed back against the Chinese flotillas. In the hotly disputed South China Sea, Indonesia sent F-16 fighter jets along with navy, coastguard and fishing boats to repel 63 Chinese fishing boats and four coastguard vessels from its waters in January.But North Korean fishing boats may have come off worse from exchanges with China’s “dark fleets”, amid reports of “ghost boats” washing up on Japanese shores containing the bodies of North Korean fishermen. In its backyard, the Chinese fleet has a fearsome reputation for systemic illegal fishing and aggressive tactics when faced with competitors or foreign patrol vessels.China signed a key UN fish stocks agreement in 1996 but never ratified it. It is a member of seven regional fishery management organisations, or RFMOs, but its distant water fleet operates outside of those frameworks, says Mercedes Rosello, director of House of Ocean, a not-for-profit legal consultancy that monitors IUU fishing.“When you are looking at thousands of vessels, the rules and mechanisms which that flag state adopts are of huge transcendence,” Rosello says.“The people who suffer first and worst are almost always the coastal communities who rely on those fisheries for their survival, wellbeing and food,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1dd4f6094c3b5c7bba4582b60eadbdf8a678dc/0_109_5222_3135/master/5222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85e617778418c19895b33d1084c4d160","title":"greta thunberg returns to school after year off","story":"Swedish environmental activist says she’s heading back to the classroom after travelling the world, spreading her conservation message Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg has returned to school after a year off campaigning to curb climate change.“My gap year from school is over, and it feels so great to finally be back in school again!” the 17-year-old tweeted, attaching a smiling photo of herself with a schoolbag on her back and her hands resting on a bicycle.Thunberg did not say in which city or school she would be continuing her studies.Since her last school year finished in June 2019, the teenager’s travels around the world meant that she ended up doing lessons remotely.Rather than head into the final years of secondary school, she travelled across the Atlantic by sailing boat – hoping to highlight the carbon emissions of flying.Her ultimate destination had been the COP25 UN climate conference in Chilean capital Santiago.But the event was ultimately shifted to Madrid because of massive unrest in Chile, leaving Thunberg to sail back from the US to Europe on board a catamaran belonging to a young Australian couple.While in North America, Thunberg rebuked world leaders at the UN, had a repeat visit with former US President Barack Obama, was given the keys to the city of Montreal and travelled around the continent in a Tesla electric car lent by former California governor and action star Arnold Schwarzenegger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/befef7d394c8d6bb229f0df063691cf62ccac094/0_403_7846_4710/master/7846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=344ed994b8426b84024cd872403a1f78","title":"special branches the nominations to be englands tree of the year in pictures","story":"A sycamore laced with the shoes of jubilant students, a haunted oak bound in chains and a Hackney plane facing the chop are among the 10 contenders to become England’s tree of the year.

Three cool monosyllables, surname first, a little curtly, as befits a former naval commander. And then, as if in afterthought, the first name, followed by the surname again – for all the world as if we needed it narrowed down, and wouldn’t recognise one of the world’s most famous fictional brands. Sean Connery carried it off with icily disdainful style, perhaps at the baccarat table, in full evening dress with a cigarette hanging from his lips.The introduction was a kind of challenge, or seduction, invariably addressed to an enemy. And the subtly anglicised Edinburgh accent, which appeared to soften or muddy those monosyllables, encouraged legions of comics and pub bores to think that they, too, could do the voice. In the early 60s, Connery’s James Bond was about as dangerous and sexy as it got on screen – until directors like Alfred Hitchcock and Sidney Lumet came along, and saw how Connery’s on-screen menace could be taken to the next level.Connery became James Bond in 1962 after minor roles in British movies and an appearance in a Walt Disney whimsy called Darby O’Gill and the Little People. As 007, he was an instant, staggering success – conveying exactly the right dangerous sexiness and borderline-sociopathic capacity for disciplined violence – much mocked, much drooled over. The former milkman and bodybuilder was the working-class Bond, a Bond who had come up through the ranks, though director Terence Young reputedly schooled him in the ways of classiness: how to dress, how to light a cigarette. Connery’s natural muscular power and wry humour modified the elegance and eccentricity of Bond in just the right way. Ian Fleming was sufficiently impressed to fabricate Scottish roots for Bond in subsequent books.As much as the Beatles, it was Connery’s charismatic Bond who kept alive Britain’s postwar amour-propre. Does Britain appear to be waning pathetically on the world stage? Oh no. Britain is still powerful – but in secret, you see, like 007. Connery’s Bond created the notion that the soft-culture brand image, the tricks and the toys, the gadgets and the cars, could be just as potent as real power and wealth. He played the role seven times, in Dr No (1962), From Russia With Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967) and then two afterthought Bonds, Diamonds Are Forever (1971), when his hairline appeared suddenly to come forward after some years of retreat, and Never Say Never Again (1983), effectively a retread of Thunderball. His public image was merged with that of 007, and he accepted this burden with the same dangerously simmering resentment and controlled anger that made him such a glorious success as Bond. Perhaps only Daniel Radcliffe has experienced the same utter immersion or self-annihilation.Connery went on to great things outside Her Majesty’s Secret Service – but it took a while. Long after he had handed in his gun and renounced his double-O licence, Connery maintained the prerogative of sexiness. For the 1999 heist caper Entrapment, nearing 70, Connery was considered an entirely plausible action lead and romantic partner for the 30-year-old Catherine Zeta-Jones.His appearance in Hitchcock’s Marnie in 1964 focused on the dark side that had been nurtured in the Bond franchise, but without the justification of missions on the secret service, it looked more unsettling. His wealthy publisher Mark Rutland is arrogant, possessive – and a rapist. The saturnine darkness of Connery answers the strangeness and anxieties in Tippi Hedren’s mysterious Marnie.The other great Connery picture from the Bond years was Sidney Lumet’s brutal The Hill (1965), in which he plays a soldier sent to a military prison camp in the Libyan desert and forced, with the others, to endure sadistic punishments such as climbing a man-made “hill” in full pack in the burning sun. This role showcased the rougher, tougher side of the young Connery that 007 had smoothed away somewhat.The 70s were a mixed bag for Connery. He appeared as the mysterious exterminator Zed in John Boorman’s cult sci-fi Zardoz (1974), and the famous image of Connery in a bizarre red posing pouch and thigh-length boots is something that has tested the faith of Connery fans for decades. He had another brilliant, brutal role in Sidney Lumet’s The Offence (1971) as a cop who has murdered a suspected child molester during interrogation and whose motivations are gradually disclosed in flashback.He had two other great films in this period. John Huston’s The Man Who Would Be King (1975) was a classic epic in the Lean style, based on the Kipling novella, in which Connery and Michael Caine play British ex-military chancers Daniel Dravot and Peachey Carnehan. Trying their luck in the fictional and worryingly named land of Kafiristan, they look to become staggeringly wealthy when the credulous natives mistake them for gods.Richard Lester’s Robin and Marian (1976) found a quieter, gentler register in Connery, owning up to his advancing years, really for the first time in his career – playing the ageing Robin Hood, opposite Audrey Hepburn’s Marian.The 80s saw Sean Connery in various autumnal and humorously self-deprecating moods. His simmer and smoulder had aged well into a potent maturity – Connery endured endless “single malt” analogies from well-meaning interviewers – and that baldness, once feared, looked like authentic masculinity. He played Agamemnon in Terry Gilliam’s Time Bandits (1981), and he also won a much-merited Academy Award for best supporting actor in Brian De Palma’s The Untouchables (1987), playing the courageous, straight-arrow cop Jimmy Malone, who helps Kevin Costner’s Eliot Ness take on Al Capone, played by Robert De Niro.Connery’s comic chops were on display playing Professor Henry Jones, disapproving dad of Indiana Jones, in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) – though Connery was only 12 years older than Ford. There were other roles, and Connery contributed to Finding Forrester (2000) and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) with great aplomb. By this time, his legendary status, quite distinct from Bond, was something he carried around with him.I’ve met Sean Connery just once, in 1999, at the Edinburgh film festival, of which he was patron, introduced to him by the festival’s then artistic director Lizzie Francke. Unlike other men of his age, Connery seemed to have got taller with his years, and I remember almost leaning back to look up at him, as if trying to see the flagstaff atop a famous building – although that was maybe just natural awe. He stood as still as a statue at those public red-carpet events, and let the guests and the paparazzi come to him.I remember him saying to me, crisply, and with a formidable air of daring me to disagree: “Lynne Ramsay’s Ratcatcher is a great film.” It was the opening film at Edinburgh that year. Of course I agreed, but could think of nothing worthwhile to do or say other than to open and close my mouth idiotically, like a goldfish, and finally squeak “Yes.” After a second or two, Sir Sean turned and resumed his conversation with Lizzie, accustomed to this sort of encounter with gobsmacked male journalists. But I’m glad I said something to this legendary figure – and didn’t try to introduce myself formally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61ad15bbcd22d8b3272a41b84acbded0b9b3fa64/0_200_2784_1671/master/2784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd63a50ef504d348314830ca8f2e6ca8","title":"tenet review christopher nolan head scratchingly ambitious","story":"Go with it, and Christopher Nolan’s high-concept action romp will leave you ripping off your face mask for air, even as you wonder what it was all aboutWho shall save cinema? Not James Bond apparently. There’s been a brand-new Daniel Craig spectacular ready to go since Easter, arguably just the thing to get punters’ actual bums back on actual seats. But Team 007 is wimping out, unwilling to splurge their product irreversibly into some potential new ruinous lockdown – and Disney has suffered a comparable bottle-loss, dumping its live-action version of the Mulan legend on to streaming services.So it’s up to the mighty Christopher Nolan to take the heroic, morale-boosting gamble and open his big new film in cinemas. Tenet is a gigantically confusing, gigantically entertaining and gigantically gigantic metaphysical action thriller in which a protagonist called The Protagonist battles cosmic incursions from the future while time flows backwards and forwards at the same time. There’s a 747 plane that crashes into a warehouse and then uncrashes back out of it, for reasons that are not immediately obvious.The palindromic narrative concept is epitomised by that coolly hi-tech, high-concept title (maybe Nolan briefly considered something similarly resonant like Radar or Noon). With its international locations and stunt set pieces along with all the temporal weirdness, it’s actually quite like a Bond film called No Time To Die To Time No.Of course it’s madly preposterous, and I sympathise with anyone who thinks that abolishing the cause-effect sequence to mess with “time” effectively cancels jeopardy and annuls suspense and moreover runs up against the illogic of what happens when the altered past meets the join of the unaltered present – what this film identifies as the “grandfather paradox”, though without solving the problem. And to some degree, all the film’s explosions (and implosions) are there to ert your attention from this basic insolubility.But for me, Tenet is preposterous in the tradition of Boorman’s Point Blank, or even Antonioni’s Zabriskie Point, a deadpan jeu d’esprit, a cerebral cadenza, a deadpan flourish of crazy implausibility – but supercharged with steroidal energy and imagination. As head-scratchers go, it’s a scalp-shredder, a skull-mangler. But it’s gloriously ambitious and I staggered out of the cinema, plucking off my face mask dizzy with Nolan-vertigo. (People wear face masks in the film also.) It’s also got moments of deadpan wit, surreality and style and Robert Pattinson may have singlehandedly made the double-breasted suit acceptable once more in men’s tailoring.Pattinson plays Neil, a dapper, and slightly louche British intelligence officer in Mumbai who makes contact with The Protagonist, played by a toughly unemoting John David Washington. The Protag, as no one calls him, is ordered by a shadowy American government agency to tackle a new cold war situation: an attack from the future from forces capable of reversing time. Washington is shown guns that suck bullets from the wall when you pull the trigger, an innovation he greets with a kind of mildly disapproving surprise, as if he is watching a TV news item about driverless Ubers. Who is going to make use of this terrifying technology and how is it to be countered? This leads our unnamed hero into contact with a mega-rich Indian contractor (elegantly played by Dimple Kapadia) and a creepy Russian oligarch (Kenneth Branagh) and his tragically poised and willowy wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki).It is Debicki who has the most recognisable human emotions here, shouting, crying and even smiling in a way that no one else quite does, and her performance is very strong, though my tiny quarrel with Tenet is that it pinches ideas wholesale from the BBC adaptation of The Night Manager, and Debicki herself is called upon to play essentially the same role. As for Washington and Pattinson, they have to tamp down their natural warmth, though there are hints of what might even be called a bromance. But that is not the point: they are not ciphers exactly, but they are agents. The point is the phenomenal, dreamlike display itself, a vision of the end of the world. Maybe Nolan wants to meditate on the great palindrome of mortality: from dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return.Perhaps Tenet is not finally as challenging as his other temporal disruptor, the early masterpiece Memento from 2000, but there are such amazing moments in it – symmetrically recurring fist-fight scenes, revisited from different viewpoints, in which the combatants are apparently governed by different time-flows: one forward, one backward. It shouldn’t make sense. It doesn’t make sense. What it makes is amazing cinema. Wow.• Tenet is released in UK cinemas on 26 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab2d7e2b780159c336a4756dade9144bb90f8d27/0_200_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a12cfe439566a997c7fd967611c0ad8b","title":"how to store summer flavours for winter cooking kitchen aide","story":"Make flavour while the sun shines in the form of pickled and fermented fruit and vegetables, and conjure up a taste of summer for the dark days of winter • Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theWhat should I be making batches of now, while it’s still summer, to add flavour to my winter cooking?Ben, SouthportLife is always better when sweet tomatoes and peaches are at hand, so it’s eminently sensible to want to feel their love in the winter dearth, too. August and September are the golden months for preserving a summer glut, so fill your boots and get sterilising those jars.As to what you should be preserving, the short answer, says Kylee Newton, author of The Modern Preserver, is “whatever you can get your hands on”. Tomatoes, however, are a good place to start. She blanches them whole, then peels, cores and covers in a large pan with salted water and boils for five minutes. “Sterilise one-litre jars and add a tablespoon of lemon juice and a teaspoon of sea salt to each,” Newton says, “then pack the still-hot jars with the drained, cooked tomatoes, leaving a 3cm space, cover with the hot cooking brine, 1cm from the rim, and seal with hot lids.”For longevity, Olia Hercules, author of Summer Kitchens, adds a little dash each of raw or good-quality vinegar and oil to jars of brine (25g salt to one litre water), garlic, allspice berries, dill and cherry tomatoes (this works with chillies and peppers, too). All tomatoes are welcome to Hercules’ preserving party: “Big, small, green or firm are also good, so if you’re growing them and they don’t ripen, not to worry.” These “flavour bombs” can then be used as a pickle, blitzed up into a sauce, added to broths (“to give acidity”) or, my personal favourite, “as a snack with vodka”.Courgettes are another go-to for Hercules: “They’re fantastic grated, or sliced thinly, and added to caramelised onions. Just cook it all down until it turns into a paste.” She stores in jars with a little oil on top, then uses as a pasta sauce, in stews, or simply spread on toast.“Stone fruits are also amazing,” Eagle says. “You can cook, dry, freeze or bottle them.” A sweet pickle, though, comes out tops: “Make a syrup but with vinegar – half sugar, half mild cider vinegar – then cook the prepared fruit in that for 30 seconds to a minute, or pour it hot over cherries and leave to steep.” The result? Sweet pickled fruit that’s mild enough to use in desserts but tangy enough to sit alongside cold meats and cheese. “You’ve also got the sweet vinegar, which you can use as a shrub for cordials and cocktails,” Eagle notes.Hercules is also a fan of stone fruit. “In Ukraine, we’re big on preserving peaches whole,” she says. “They’re so easy: make a sugar syrup. add interesting herbs such as lemon verbena or vanilla, then poach them whole. You’re basically making tinned peaches.” Her top serving tip: slice and add to a homemade cake with cream, or folded into the batter. Sounds just, er, peachy.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Two further appointments are officials from the Department for International Development (DfID).Barrow, who joined the FCO in 1986, was appointed as the UK’s EU ambassador in January 2017.Staff at the FCO and DfID have been reassured that the merger, announced by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, in June, does not represent a takeover by the FCO.However, the timing and makeup of the leadership team were immediately questioned by critics, who argue the new department will jeopardise Britain’s position as a world leader in development and risk abandoning its commitment to poor people in low-income countries.Staff were told by the new department’s permanent secretary, Sir Philip Barton, that the makeup of the team would send “an important signal about our ambition for the FCDO, our determination to integrate diplomacy and development in a transformational way”, the Financial Times reported.The two DfID officials on the leadership team are Juliet Chua, director general for finance and corporate performance, and Moazzam Malik, director general of country programmes. Malik will serve as director general for Africa at the FCDO.Preet Gill, Labour’s shadow international development secretary, said: “We are really surprised. Allegedly the department is supposed to be up and running by 1 September. To announce the leadership team a week before that is pretty typical of the incompetence and bluster of this government.”Gill, who has described the new Whitehall department as a takeover by the FCO, said: “There is nothing here to convince me otherwise.”She added: “There are only two DfID people here. FCO people are going to be leading in development, but they don’t have the experience and understanding. It is the world’s poorest who will suffer.”Stephanie Draper, CEO of Bond, the UK network for development NGOs, said: “We are disappointed to see a complete lack of balance between development and foreign policy experience in the newly announced FCDO interim leadership team and are concerned this could be a sign of development increasingly taking a back seat to diplomatic and commercial interests.”She added: “If this merger is to succeed, then it requires a balance across areas of expertise such as tackling disease, assisting humanitarian and peacebuilding efforts, providing sanitation and clean water, or securing access to quality education for girls. It is critical that the final senior team and non-executive roles have an equal balance of development and diplomatic experience.”Sarah Champion, Labour MP and chair of the international development committee which scrutinises UK aid, said: “Consistently, I’ve been concerned that this is a hostile takeover rather than an equal partnership. The makeup of the senior leadership team just reinforces that for me.”The committee’s interim report into the effectiveness of aid, published in June, argued strongly that an independent aid-giving department with a cabinet-level minister leading its work was imperative if the UK was to help end extreme poverty.The merger has been widely criticised, including by three former prime ministers, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c2cf1fb62cd04258061f9520dd1c1b72c650f0a/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=24d21699b74f3c268014e700a1eebd4e","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Despite government support, having to close their doors for months had a crippling effect on many and forced them to take action to keep afloat.For Steve Sanderson, founder of the independent menswear retailer Oi Polloi, lockdown pressed fast forward on an already tough situation for small businesses. The company’s store in Manchester has always been at its heart, but it also has a strong online and social presence. “Bricks and mortar operations are really difficult,” he says. “What’s going on at the moment is sort of a super fast wormhole journey into the future.”Sanderson says that things are going to be particularly tough for fashion stores, with an inevitable drop in footfall, plus the issues of being Covid-19-secure, such as being unable to let customers try on clothes unless the items are quarantined or cleaned afterwards. “If people can’t try things on, why would they come in to a clothes shop?” he asks.There are, though, some rays of hope. “We have a good connection with customers through our bricks and mortar business, and certain people will always like that. But we can’t afford to just be open – we have to find a way of making it work.“We’ll have to adapt and become something else, something people can’t get from anywhere else. I like the idea of click and collect because you can do something quite interesting with that. You could then also narrow down the time the store itself is open.”For Michelle Drew, co-founder of Established 25 Atelier, which sells fashion and home accessories, the coronavirus crisis forced her to reassess her ambitions. Before lockdown, Drew, who started in 2017 making scarves and bags for friends and family, was selling at a quarterly design market in Greenwich and had a monthly stall at Spitalfields market. When Covid-19 brought things grinding to a halt, her first thought was that she needed to get her website up and running, and really engage online. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says.Since then, Drew has joined online workshops and used the time to rethink her plans. “Previously, I thought I’d love to collaborate with other designers and have a premises. I’m now wondering if that’s the way forward, because so much has changed and I’m not sure things will ever be the same.”While Drew plans to return to physical selling at some point, she sees her business relying more on online trading. “It’s still a precarious situation. I definitely will return to the markets because I enjoy the contact, but I’m looking at other ways to move the business forward.”Bigger retailers, too, have faced challenges, for all their greater resources. Some have come through with flying colours, though, particularly if they had the right technology to hand.For Tesco, the coronavirus crisis brought an unprecedented surge in demand, but the company was well placed to react quickly. It already had emergency plans in place thanks to a “doomsday” management exercise four years ago. It had also embraced remote working, and had the technology to handle communication with 460,000 staff, suppliers, people services and security operations. These systems allowed the company to double its capacity for delivery and click and collect in just six weeks. Improvements to the computer algorithms used to drive picking technology – plus the army of pickers hired to cope with the increased demand – mean that whatever the future brings, the chain appears to have the flexibility to deal with it.Similarly, the online flower delivery company Bloom \u0026amp Wild proved its resilience. For its founder Aron Gelbard, protecting jobs by staying open was important, as was providing people with a way of showing they care for the loved ones they couldn’t see in lockdown.With its tailored CRM system, which manages queries from a range of channels, Bloom \u0026amp Wild now employs more than 25 customer service agents who manage between 3,000 and 3,500 inquiries every week – rising dramatically during peak times such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and, undoubtedly, lockdown.The company uses Zendesk to manage its customer relationships, allowing agents to deal with inquiries across Twitter, email, phone, online chat, Facebook Messenger and SMS. Alongside this, analytics help the company forecast customer demand and plan for peaks.As a business that exists purely in the virtual world, it’s an example to retailers everywhere of what can be achieved by clever use of technology.Things are changing fast.

The news was confirmed in a statement from British Gymnastics, who said they had agreed with Reddin that she would temporarily step aside from her role as head national coach “to allow an investigation to proceed into claims about her conduct as a coach”.“The investigation will be completed by an external independent expert and any outcome actioned immediately,” it added. “Our processes and investigations will also be scrutinised by the independent review.” understands that GB Gymnastics’ performance director, James Thomas, will take over Reddin’s role while the investigation is carried out.Reddin’s methods at GB Gymnastics have been called into question by leading athletes, with Rio Olympian Ruby Harrold claiming that she presided over a “culture of fear” at the Team GB camps in Lilleshall, and described food portions that left her and her fellow gymnasts hungry.Harrold said: “How would you feel if you were 21 years old being given ultimately a baby plate to eat off? It’s demeaning ... it’s unhealthy.”Olympic bronze medallist Amy Tinkler also launched a blistering attack on British Gymnastics on Tuesday after they dismissed her complaint against Reddin, saying she felt “sick” at the outcome – and warning that it would discourage other gymnasts from speaking out.After revealing for the first time that Reddin was part of a complaint about bullying in the sport made last December, Tinkler said that the governing body had told her that her allegations against Reddin had been dealt with and the matter was closed.“On Friday, and only in response to media pressure, I was emailed informing me that my complaints had been dealt with and the matter closed,” she wrote on Twitter.“The way I received this information made me sick. It reinforced mine and every gymnasts’ fear, which is that their complaints aren’t dealt with fairly and independently. This is why we don’t speak up. This is why we suffer in silence. We know that to speak up is a pointless, career-ending task.”British Gymnastics confirmed that an investigation into Tinkler’s complaint about bullying while she was at South Durham Gymnastics Club is still ongoing.Separately, the BBC and ITV News has reported that Reddin, who is due to lead the women’s gymnastics team to next year’s Games in Tokyo, has also been cleared of one historical allegation of abuse.The BBC said that a gymnast called Jenny, who had been coached by Reddin at the Bright School of Gymnastics in the 1980s, told BBC Sport that she had been slapped and verbally abused by the coach.In its response, British Gymnastics said Reddin had categorically denied slapping gymnasts, saying she would only give “little taps and nibbles” to show gymnasts how they should be working. It also said she denied using “excessive force” on a gymnast to stretch them.In a response to the allegations, which was made before the investigation against her was announced, Reddin said: “I completely refute the historical claim, and the investigation by British Gymnastics did not uphold the complaint. I completely refute these claims, it is wrong that my reputation within the sport that I love is now subject to a trial by media rather than through the proper processes.“I would welcome the allegations be submitted to the independent review into alleged abuse in gymnastics to ensure the integrity of the process is protected for both athletes and coaches.”Meanwhile UK Sport and Sport England have announced that that independent review into abuse in gymnastics at all levels of the sport in Britain between 2008 and 2020 would be led by the QC Anne Whyte. It said the review would look into:The independent review came after dozens of British gymnasts spoke out about abuse in the system, including the world championship medallists Becky and Ellie Downie, who said that “cruel” behaviour was “so ingrained in our daily lives that it became completely normalised” - although they did not mention any coaches by name.Among the other gymnasts to speak publicly about the abuse they had faced were the British Olympians Francesca Fox, who said she was constantly told she “looked like a hippo” and the the four-times Olympic medallist Louis Smith, who accused British Gymnastics of not wanting to taint its image by alerting the public to complaints made against coaches.

If you were asked to guess at the year the British media first covered a women’s county game, you might place it within the past decade. Perhaps, aware of the golden age that existed between the world wars – of names like Betty Snowball and Myrtle Maclagan – you would fix on the 1930s. It’s unlikely you’d go all the way back to 1811, when Hampshire and Surrey XIs played each other, watched on by the sportswriter, and observer of London life, Pierce Egan.This was no piece of hit and giggle. The game was played over three days – a Wednesday, Thursday and Monday in early October – on a field near Newington Green in north London. It was deemed “very excellent play” by Egan, who was impressed by the Surrey bowling and fielding, and drew a large crowd, its result staked for 500 guineas by two competing aristocrats. An innings of 41 by one of the Hampshire batters (cruelly run out in her pomp) helped Hampshire to a two-wicket win, despite interruptions for poor weather. When it was done, the women, keen to keep playing, arranged a single-wicket match, then walked half an hour down the road for a picnic at the Angel, Islington.Women have been playing cricket since its early incarnations in the middle ages. The proof is under lock and key at Oxford’s Bodleian Library, where a group of them are depicted in a 14th-century painting, playing a mixed game in which the central figure is a female bowler. Village matches for women were popular throughout the 18th century, and there were men willing to support and encourage the pursuit.What changed those attitudes? The bourgeois inclinations of the Victorians, that’s what. In Ladies and Lords, her academic history of the game, Raf Nicholson notes that in the 18th century, cricket was still “largely confined to the lower classes”. The emergence of the new English middle class, and its “consignment of women to the home” as part of the feminine ideal, was the real reason women’s cricket all but disappeared.“In such an environment, opportunities for partaking in sport were minimal,” writes Nicholson. By the time the game regained fashion among women in the late 19th century, it was considered “manly”. Men’s aptitude for the game was considered essential to the future of the empire women’s was either a curiosity or a near-political act.There has been valid concern whether, in the post-pandemic sporting landscape, male priorities might, once again, stunt the progress of women’s cricket. When South Africa and India’s women both pulled out of a planned triangular tournament against England, it fed the narrative that, when times get tough, opportunities for women are the first to be sacrificed.And yet, the behind-the-scenes story during this season of Covid-19 has been a far more positive one. When the England and Wales Cricket Board signed off its emergency budget to stage international cricket behind closed doors, it was done with equal provision for the men’s and women’s teams. Medical and operational resources, biosecure bubbles and broadcast offerings were all treated the same for arguably the first time in history, England women’s games would be delivered on the same footing as the men’s. The women’s international fixtures remain under negotiation, but confirmation of a visiting team is expected soon.Meanwhile the eight new regional hubs created by the ECB’s action plan last year will play their first domestic games this weekend – exactly when they were always intended to. The format of this year’s domestic competition is a one-off, with the Rachael Heyhoe-Flint Trophy mirroring the men’s Bob Willis Cup in its regional-group structure. Clare Connor, the governing body’s managing director of women’s cricket, says that, because of the limitations imposed by coronavirus, their domestic men’s and women’s cricket operations are the most integrated they have ever been.“I’ve never felt more confident than this summer about the growing importance of the women’s game and its standing to be treated equally,” says Connor. “The standards of delivery, medical protocols, even the fact that we’ll be chartering flights for any opposition teams who come over to play – that’s a multimillion pound investment.”Connor says that, contrary to fears, there has been a “very determined attitude and appetite” to maintain momentum in the professionalisation of women’s cricket. Full-time domestic contracts for 40 players are still planned to come into effect from 1 October and 25 regional retainers, reportedly worth £1,000 a month, were put in place during lockdown.Connor is not the only person who sees a golden opportunity for a more gender-neutral game in the aftermath of Covid-19. This month, Simon Hughes and IPL owner Manoj Badale publish a book called A New Innings. As it searches for business strategies that could help cricket out of the crisis, it makes a strong argument that women should be at the centre of these.“I can’t stress enough how important female engagement is,” he says. “The pandemic has increased the importance of the amateur club as a centre of community, providing everything from yoga to book clubs. So the more women and girls you can include in that offer the more the game will strengthen in numbers.” Perhaps cricketing history is about to get a new chapter.• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

It seems to be lodged in my head as something that did happen, but I’m getting on a bit and for some reason I may have invented this. Can the delightful OBO faithful help me out on this?”I should know this as I was working on the Channel 4 cricket website at the time, but I’m pretty sure I’d also done a Rookwood.Finally, at the Oval in 2018, Anderson completed the Who Writes Your Scripts Test by becoming going past Glenn McGrath to became the most prolific quick bowler in Test history.The crowd know what time it is. Every delivery from Anderson is cheered like a hat-trick ball - and he needs only three balls to clean up Mohammed Shami! It burst straight through him to hit the stumps. England have won the match and James Anderson has taken 564 Test wickets - more than any quick bowler in the history of Test cricket. It’s an apt way to end a fairytale Test for England’s beloved old farts.At Lord’s in 2017, he cleaned up Kraigg Brathwaite to reach a barely believable milestone.James Anderson becomes the first Englishman to take 500 Test wickets!It was a brilliant delivery from Anderson: on a full length and roaring back through to the gate to bowl Brathwaite. He didn’t have to wait long that was his 12th delivery of the innings It all started here against Zimbabwe 14 years ago, when he was a talented kid with diabolical hair, and now he has 500 Test wickets. By the end of his career, he should have more Test wickets than any fast bowler in history. He’s an old don with a sober haircut these days, an absolute master of his craft whose returns have been better than ever in the last couple of years. All the England balcony are on their feet, and Anderson smiles almost sheepishly as he raises the ball to the crowd. A few spots of rain, umbrellas are raised, and then the players are taken off. The final action sees Anderson take his 400th Test wicket, a classic slip catch, taken high by Bell at second slip!A great moment for Anderson, and he doesn’t really get time to enjoy it, so quickly is he ordered to set off back to the changing rooms. Anderson’s 384th Test wicket, which put him ahead of Sir Ian Botham as England’s leading wickettaker, came in Antigua in 2015.That’s it! Anderson has done it! Ramdin is beaten all ends up by a beauty, a leg-cutter that finds the outside edge and flies to Cook at slip. He’s out on his own – the most prolific wicket-taker in Test cricket for England.Lovely delivery jagging in and looking to straighten slightly. Fulton played forward and it clipped the outside edge, Swann taking a fine catch low at second slip, his hands getting underneath the ball as he stooped forward. Jimmy joins the 300 club. I’d have had money in 2005 on Steve Harmison getting there.And here’s No200, during a(nother) heavy defeat at the Waca in 2010WICKET! Siddle 8 c Collingwood b Anderson (84th over: Australia 308-9) lead by 390 There’s one. Siddle pokes a catch straight to third slip. That’s Anderson’s 200th Test wicket, in his 54th Test. He’s had to wait on 199 a little longer than he would have liked. Still, that makes him the ninth fastest Englishman to the mark, one match behind both Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard. He’s the second youngest to do it though, after old Iron Bottom. What odds he could be the man to go on and break Botham’s all-time record for Test wickets for England? Here’s No100, against South Africa at the Oval in 2008 Another big appeal as Anderson beats the edge with Kallis fending. Ambrose says yes. Umpire says no. Two balls later Anderson swings one back in, catching Kallis flush on the pad. Anderson says yes, umpire says yes! That was a fantastic ball from Anderson. This is a proper collapse.  Kallis was Anderson’s 100th Test wicket, by the way, not bad for a man who’s spent so much time in the international peripheries. Let’s start with Jimmy’s first wicket, and a snapshot into a frankly more enjoyable world. Anderson bowled Zimbabwe’s Mark Vermuelen in the first Test at Lord’s. But it didn’t make it onto the OBO, because - and you’ll like this - it was a beautiful Friday evening in London and Dan Rookwood was thirstful.Having moments ago faced his first balls in Test cricket, Anderson now bowls some. It’s not the best opening over ever: two no-balls, three fours and 17 runs coming off it. Ah well, it’s 6pm and that’s my shift over. Thanks for your email company.For more up-to-date and, let’s face it, probably more enlightening coverage of the remaining 18 overs of the day, click on the scorecard here.Thanks Daniel, hello everyone. The umpires still look a bit uneasy with the state of the outfield they will inspect again at 3.35pm. While we wait for some play, and hopefully Jimmy Anderson’s 600th wicket, I thought I’d delve into the OBO archives to see how we reported his previous landmarks.On which note, it’s time for me to call it a Test-match summer – thanks all for your company and comments, sorry I couldn’t get to them all. Here’s Rob Smyth to guide you through Jimmy’s 600th and Broad’s 5-11. “56 hours? Pah!” says Martyn Baker of my pathetic sojourn. “Loads of people must have taken the pre-cheap flights Magic Bus down to Athens from London. I did it in 1982 – two-and-a-half days of discomfort. Still, I was young and carefree so…”I remember a log-in on a football forum years ago, which was The Bus to Videoton – who Manchester United played in 1985. Momentarily excited, I checked Google Maps, but that effort comes in at a paltry 22 hours.“Left Casablanca airport before the start of play,” says Nick Cherkas of his 250819. “Expected a few lofted strikes to mid on before an Aussie win around lunchtime. Spent eight hours travelling to Saudi before getting some WiFi at Jeddah airport. Couldn’t believe my eyes - and many other bemused travellers and pilgrims couldn’t believe their ears. ‘Get in Stokesy you beauty!’ Finally arrived in Riyadh and watched the highlights. Happy days. It was also my daughter’s 14th birthday – she got a shout out on the OBO in 2005 which brought an England wicket. Perhaps a happy 15th birthday to Layla might bring the sun out in Southampton?”“ I did a 48-hour greyhound trip from Miami to Toronto,” brags John Culley, “changing buses in New York. From NY I did a reverse charges call to my dad to tell him I was OK and he told me that England had somehow beaten Australia in the final match of the 1993 Ashes, thanks to Graeme Hick, Steve Watkin and others. Jumping up and down in excitement, much to the bemusement of assorted drunks, homeless people and police officers who inhabit American bus stations at 2 in the morning.”The easy availability of sport is obviously a good thing, but I also miss the effort of following it, especially during my formative years. Being abroad and getting people to play coverage down the line, for example, my favourite memory being listening to the penalty shoot-out at the end of the 1997-98 play-off final, with a Sunderland fan. “I finally gave up trying to keep my sons interested in cricket when they were about 11,” says John Moloney, “defeated by the lack of organised cricket or media coverage here in Denmark. At least the boys did not take up handball. Having just sent older son off to 6th form boarding school (Sorø Akademi) near Copenhagen, I was mightily surprised to get a mail from him yesterday telling me he’d taken up cricket. What? A check of the Sorø website revealed to my astonishment that they have a coach, a team, and were the site of the very first cricket match in Denmark (7th October 1866 since you ask). I had no idea. O frabjous day! Hope renewed! Who’d have thought?I have just sent him the link to the OBO, and a copy of the Harold Larwood book recommended by someone here yesterday (thank you). Desperate to nurture the flame without swamping the poor boy.”“So on this day last year I’d been out and about visiting galleries in an increasingly distracted fashion,” says David Abel, “checking my phone every few seconds or hours depending on whether time is real or perceived, and knowing that if a text pinged from one of my friends that it would be all over but hoping to get back to see the end. The strange thing is that as an Anglo-Sri Lankan I’d already gone through exactly the same experience on the 16th of February that year when Kusal Perera played the innings of his or indeed anyone’s life in Durban. What a ridiculous sport.Time is illmatic, obviously, but yes, Perera’s innings is up there with the greatest we’ve ever seen. I guess we might rank those against better attacks higher, but that’s got to be the only aspect in which it’s surpassable. Back to cut away, cut away, here’s Richard O’Hagan. “The definitive use of that line in song is surely in the utterly bonkers One Armed Scissor by At The Drive-In. There’s a lovely passage in Jim Bob Carter USM’s latest book where he describes the utter bafflement of everyone at seeing them perform it on Jools Holland.“I’m struck by how many of the songs in Hamilton have titles that seem to have links to Test Cricket,” notes Kim Thonger. “Are there subliminal depths in this show and is its success in fact due to this possible dual interpretation?

Secondly, for those interested, this pod on the song Satsified is brilliant. “Yes this is another ‘I was there’ email,” says Sam Charlton. “I volunteer with St John Ambulance as a nurse. It was quite something, the usual drunk injuries, dehydration and other cricket related complaints, had all stopped after the lunch break. It was another cricketing miracle. It meant all of the team could watch the events unfolding, and even those who didn’t like cricket could tell something special was happening.”Congruence ≠ Correlation, but a collective sucking it up seems to have gone on here. “In the absence of any play yet,” returns Jon Blair, “how about a competition (no prizes) asking for best suggestions to play the following heroes and villains?Balthazar John Vorster - Nazi sypathiser, South African Prime Minister, needless to say a VillainAnton Rupert - South African businessman, head of a tobacco empire, VillainJack Cheetham - former South African cricket captain, innocent dupe or collaborating villain? Hard to sayGeorge “Gubby” Allen - MCC secretary and Supervillain.“I disagree with Kim on adjusting according to daylight hours,” says Adrian Goldman of the earlier scheduling suggestion. “There is hysteresis involved in the response of the ground all things being equal, the air is colder two hours after sunrise than two hours before sunset. Also, the rate of change in sunrise and sunset around midsummer is quite slow. So a fixed start time is perfectly rational – unless it is forecast to rain at 5pm, whereas it is perfectly sunny at 10.30 am. And, unlike even 30-20-10 years ago, the short-range, local forecasts are extremely accurate.”“Bits of commentary rarely stick in my head the way that, say, quotes from Spaced do,” tweets D Johns, “but Agnew’s “It’s six or out! IT’S SIX!” does, maybe a little bit because of the resonance of childhood six-and-out rules, maybe because I’ve never heard Agnew lose it like that.”Yep, an incredible moment. Though there are one or two at the  with earlier experience of the same. “As it is Ben Stokes Day, I should share my memory,” says Ekky Haque. “I was living in Da Nang, Vietnam but I teach English online to mainly Japanese students and it was my stupid fault that I didn’t take a day off so I resorted to streaming it on my phone while I was teaching.As the game got quite tense, I had a mate trying to reassuring me that we’ll do it but I still carry scars from when I started following England in the 90s. I was multitasking pretty well until the missed run out but luckily I was teaching a 5yo so it was impeccable timing that I was teaching him about emotions. When Stokes hit the winning runs an involuntary tear ran down my cheek and I was teaching Alice in Wonderland, so just hoping my student was thinking that I was getting emotional over this. When I need something to cheer me up, I watch the final day again just to remind me that miracles still happen. More so now as I’ve been stuck in Kathmandu for the past 6 months...”Alice in Wonderland and Ben Stokes, there cannot be many better combinations than that. “Will you run a little faster?” said a ginger to the tail, “There’s an Aussie close behind us, and he’s aiming for my bail.”“Here’s Stokes’ innings set to Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture,” offers Tom Knight. “It’s the sort of thing some people might like.”It’s the sort of thing all people should absolutely like. Sensational. “I was on my bed in a little holiday hut near the gorgeous beach in Camerota in Cilento, southern Italy,” says Colum Fordham. “Despite his greater interest in football and Napoli, my younger son Simone (Italian spelling) even got into the incredible partnership of Stokes and Leach and watched the final moments on SKY with me via a slightly illegal streaming site whilst also following the OBO. Our shouts and screams (mine mainly) could be heard down the little avenue of the campsite but most people were at the beach so I don’t think we caused too much of a disturbance. My Italian wife Roberta humoured me and looked delighted at the result when I came rushing out to tell her as she relaxed on her sunlounger. “Bene,” she said before saying, “Shall we have a swim now?”.I like the photo of the Sopranos which I’m finally getting around to seeing properly. (just about finished the first series). Excellent stuff, almost as good as your OBO coverage during this summer of love (of Test match cricket).”The Sopranos is the greatest art of my lifetime (in my opinion). Enjoy it. And allow me to recommend the Talking Sopranos podcast (but stay away until you’ve watched till the end) and Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz’s Sopranos Sessions book.Robert Robkey says the pitch is much better than when he last saw it, but isn’t sure we’ll get on within the hour following the next inspection. It’s going to take a serious stuartbroad from one of England’s bowlers to force a win. “I was living in Brighton at the time, and it was the summer of my master’s dissertation,” writes Joel Foreman. “I woke up that morning assuming that I’d be able to have the cricket on the TV and my laptop open with my thesis on it, editing and note-taking. I think the first hour of the day was mildly productive but by midday I’d closed down the laptop, cancelled meeting friends at the beach and bunkered down for the second greatest afternoon of the summer. Is that right? I think I just about put the World Cup win over this innings, wonder if others agree?”It’s the World cup for me, and not by the barest of margins. That isn’t because I don’t appreciate the gravity of Heading, Heading ley. But the World Cup win was something I’d been waiting for nearly all my life, since I was laid on the couch as an ill eight-year-old, watching Gatting reverse-sweep Border since I made a mess of a maths exam as a wild 13-year-old, listening to a Game Boy earphone tucked down the arm of my school blazer as Harvey fell short and all the rest of it. Hopefully we’ll get some play shortly after that. “Last summer I was attending a friend’s wedding in Slovakia during the Headingley Test,” says Phil Lacy. “The day after, in the scorching sun, I followed Stokes and friends stumbling and bumbling their way to apparent defeat while sitting on a jam-packed coach to Bratislava. Sitting in a St*rbucks in a Bratislava shopping centre, dying of heat exhaustion, I’m not sure what was more refreshing: the ridiculous but delicious iced coffee drink, or the madness of Jack Leach helping Stokes do the unthinkable, possibly the only person for miles around with an interest in the game.”“We were over from France to help our daughter and partner with their new house,” explains Richard Hirst. “And now we are there again, braving quarantine, because we hadn’t seen them since Christmas. As the greatest Bob said, Ah, but I was so much older then.......”He was 24 when he wrote that. 24! But he didn’t make a double century for England at 22. “Luke Richardson’s email has triggered something in me,” says Oliver. “There are two moments of commentary that really stick with me from that. One is before Stokes’ switch hit six, where the commentators are both saying he’ll start to look for a single – not Stokes. Never Stokes.The other is the pair of ‘That’s all the way isn’t it?!’ and Up in the air again. Western Terrace again! Six again!!’. I was, of course, glued to the OBO - it was only watching the highlights that I got the terrific commentary that went with the run chase. What a magnificent day.”The way the commentary team elevated the action without elevating themselves remains a staggering achievement. “Just reviewing the footage,” emails Brian Withington, “I was very pleased to see that Jack Leach was sporting a trusty bat from Taunton’s Millichamp \u0026amp Hall – carefully selected supplier of my son’s early blades. Stokes on the other hand opted for the Gunn \u0026amp Moore with bazooka attachment.”I will forever be a Grey-Nicolls double scoop advocate, mainly because I’m not strong. “A year ago,” says Smylers, “I was simultaneously pleased to have finally ended a decade without seeing live Test cricket, for a variety of reasons (rain, inconveniently timed holidays, my own ineptitude at booking tickets, the ECB not awarding Headingley any Tests in a summer, England losing within 3 days and — most unexpectedly of all — England winning within 3 days) while also a little disappointed that, after all this wait, the question was only whether England would lose slowly or collapse quickly.Obviously those low expectations made what happened in the afternoon so much the better. During the morning our group caught up with each other, a general buzz around the ground suggesting others were similarly engaged. In the afternoon though there was no chat, everybody focussing on the cricket. The cheers between balls (a Jack Leach dot ball greeted as enthusiastically as a Ben Stokes boundary) alternated with near silence as each bowler ran in. Nobody needed to say anything: we all knew exactly what each other were thinking.Thank you to my friend Susanna for offering the spare ticket, and even more so to her sister’s boss — if Helena hadn’t been sent on a work trip that week, her ticket wouldn’t ever have become spare. Sorry you missed out, Hel.”Yes, it’s a while since every ball seemed like its own discrete match – the last time I felt that way was probably England v South Africa for the mace in 2012, though the 2013 English summer Ashes had their moments. Right, I guess that’s “lunch”. Thanks for your company and comments to this point I’ll be back in 40 to get through those I’ve not yet got through, and for the inspection that will hopefully result in some cricket. “On Nasser’s ‘Cut away, Cut away’ moment,” says Fergus Pickles, “it’s not so much biblical as heroic and epic in the truest literary sense, invoking the dactyllic meter favoured by Homer and also used so famously in Tennyson’s Charge of the Light Brigade: ‘Half a league, Half a league Half a league Onward All in the valley of death Rode the six hundred’.”It is certainly that, but can it not be both? “I remember it well,” says Rich Harding of his 25 August 2019. “I was cruising my narrowboat up the Trent and Mersey Canal, through Preston Brook tunnel, and onto the Bridgewater Canal. It was around the time that I got onto the Bridgewater that 5 Live went over to the live commentary on Sports Extra - I normally cruise with my AM radio, so was just getting updates to that point. I can vividly remember passing various people asking for news, and letting out an almighty roar at the climax, somewhat disturbing a towpath barbecue.As an aside, Ads and Colin, the two guys in the bubble who run the electronic site screens  boards, are also both narrowboaters, and very good friends of ours. Colin’s the one with the dreads.”What I’m loving about these accounts is how they capture what Christopher Moltissanti termed “The regularness of life”. He was complaining about it, but the beauty of a sport which takes place over such a long period is how it twizzles itself around all that we are. “Sitting by the shores of Lake Titicaca,” says Kieran Donoghue of his whereabouts a year ago. “Had checked out but hung around the hotel to use the Wi-Fi and follow the match on Guerilla cricketthe OBO. My wife was very patient – fortunately we had several hours to kill before our bus to La Paz so there was no rush.”Tangentially, what’s the longest bus ride you’ve ever done or, put another way, can anyone beat 56 hours, from Lencois in Salvador, Brasil, to Iguacu Falls? “A year ago I was at a dire La Liga game watching RCD Mallorca lose 1-0 to Real Sociedad,” emails David Jacob. “Cricket on my headphones. Many bemused Spanish football supporters wondering why I was cheering randomly.”“Memories, misty watercoloured mem’ries,” muses James Debens. “I was following the OBO on my iPhone, walking laps of my father-in-law’s Peugeot that he parks in his kitchen on the eastern coast of Spain. My wife and her family were chatting at the table, slightly confused by my striding, but our two King Charles iels were following my circuits as I clocked up my daily 20k. Alas, our beloved Bentley passed away of lymphoma 12 weeks ago, but I have the happy memories of that day. In fact, if play begins, I might put on those bright yellow Converse again and do laps of the dining table to recreate the good vibes and will on Jimmy’s 600th. My brother-in-law has only ever followed two cricket matches: firstly, when England achieved the highest ever team ODI score against Pakistan in 2016, posting 444-3 and last year’s Stokes-does-Hulk-smash wonder game in the Ashes. So David must think that cricket is part of the Marvel universe.”But what does he think about bright yellow Converse? “Over the years I’ve tried to introduce cricket to my (Italian) partner’s friends and family, starting with the Ashes series that was available live on the ECC Youtube channel in 2013,” says Mike Barron. “They gave up any interest last year as I sat with them (but not with them at all, if you get my drift) at a gelateria in Francavilla al Mare, shouting along with the OBO on my phone, until finally doing a strange jig around the tables, my partner sadly offering the only apology required…. ‘E Inglese…!’”“This time last year I was in a French campsite having just completed my stint as part of a team taking part in a 24-hour cycling race around the Le Mans circuit. My equally knackered teammates (who weren’t quite as absorbed or obsessed by the cricket as I was) didn’t really appreciate my getting increasingly distracted by the radio as we edged closer and closer throughout the afternoon, especially when I was supposed to be helping take down the tent.I twigged with about half an hour left that there was another British group sitting nearby, also listening to TMS and getting excited. As their radio appeared to be about 20 seconds behind I tried not to react too loudly when each boundary was scored or when Lyon fluffed the runoutburned the review and had the LBW turned down. I failed to keep very quiet when that final four was scored, though. I can only hope for their sake they hadn’t twigged that we were also listening and that they thought I was just really excited about getting the tent and all its poles back in the bag.”In fairness, that is an invigorating moment. “Cut away, cut away” also reminds me of this. The lyrics have certainly changed in my bathtub renditions. “After yesterday’s glorious trip through cricket and literature I was going to hold fire today,” confesses Pete Salmon, “but your suggestion that ‘Cut away, cut away for four’ has a Biblical feel has dragged me back. It’s an example of parallelism – the Lord himself tends to use it, and if its good enough for Him. You’ve got your synonymous parallelism, your antithetic, your formal, your synthetic and your emblematic. Nasser’s is synthetic I think, but I have to check my Robert Alter translation of the Bible to be sure, to be sure. Sits up next to the Wisdens obviously.”My favourite translation is the JPS, but I wondered if Nasser’s bit was deliberately anaphoric or just him adapting to a change in circumstance as he realised the ball was going to the fence. “There’s probably about two hours before I really need to go to bed,” says Phil Withall, “so you may as well step out for a bite to eat and a cup of whatever  journalists are drinking these days.“Ten minutes after I have retired play will resume, Jimmy will then take his 600th wicket and I will awake tomorrow to the combination of elation and regret that have accompanied my cricketing life for so many years.”From your mouth to His ears. “I was watching while spending a couple of weeks with my Spanish family-in-law at their holiday home in a small village,” recounts Ewan McDonald. “No-one could quite understand how I had been following the same game for days, least of all my father-in-law as I tried to explain the rules in my middling Spanish.My wife, who has no interest in the sport, joined me for the last wicket partnership, and was literally leaping around the living room with excitement. What a day. Nothing’s better than Test cricket.”It’s not easy“I live in Edinburgh, and it’s normally festival time in August,” says David Jarman. “For final hour or so of That Test Match I was at the opera, with TMS playing in one earpiece. My heart swelled with the winning runs, I clenched my fists. I looked around to see everyone rapt in the drama of the moment as Wagner’s Ring Cycle headed towards its finale. I wiped some dust from my eye. Jimmy Anderson is great, isn’t he?”Heh, this reminds me of story. A few years ago, we lost a good mate of mine, and at the end of a dreadful week, I went to see Beyoncé as my wife is a huge fan (I have since been to Rome in order to do the same). Anyhow, the purchase of Personality Enhancer was extremely dear and extremely time-consuming, so little bottles of wine deposited into a pint pot made most sense. I was getting to end of my second and realised that my eyeballs were sweating, a fact not lost on the woman next to me, who leant over, put a hand on my shoulder, and said soothingly “Beyoncé’s great, isn’t she?”“Yesterday’s OBO erted into how difficult it is to get films featuring cricket financed,’ emails Jon Blair. “Well here’s a thing. For the last four years Michael Grade (yes, one and the same Lord Grade) and I (You can google me to see what I have done in the past) have been trying to get the finance together for a feature film based on Peter Oborne’s magnificent book about the political conspiracy to ensure Basil D’Oliviera wouldn’t get picked for the infamous England tour of South Africa in 1968. It is as much a story of racism at the highest levels of the MCC and the British establishment, as well as the mendacity of the then England captain along with the more predictable corrupt practices of the Powers-that-Were in the South African government, as it is a story of cricket, all set against the generational political changes of 1968, but here we still are without anyone prepared to finance it. Whether that is due to no appetite for a story featuring a cricketer at its heart, or something else I won’t ever know, but to say it is heartbreaking not to be able to tell this story on the big screen or even television is heartbreaking.”Yes, that sounds great, and I feel you. When we were thinking about cricketing stories that would translate well to the silver screen, this one immediately sprung to mind. On TMS last week, Manoj Badale, owner of Rajasthan Royals, was saying that cricket has a big opportunity in America because of the growing south Asian population, so perhaps that, along with the growing recognition of south Asia itself, might help. I hope so. “Gah,” says Sean Clayton. “I’ve now got the closing paragraph of your opening stuck in my head, to the tune of Alanis Morrisette’s ‘Thank U’. Worst of all, it almost, but doesn’t quite, scan. (I suppose I should be grateful that it’s not to the tune of the old Cadbury’s Roses advert).”We’re at Headingley, so I guess I can tangentially reference the song sung to the Roses tune when Leeds beat Arsenal to hand Manchester United the title in 2003. “Wow-wee! What are we witnessing here from Ben Stokes?!”“What a summer he’s having! What a cricketer he is!”“Watching the footage of that last hour from Headingley reminds me how different it all looks with a crowd in,” says Tim Stafford. “I have loved the cricket this summer but imagine how much better it would be again to see it played in front of packed houses or – even better – be helping to pack the house yourself. I had given up on the Headingley game after Woakes had fallen, and was at the pub for my friend’s birthday. With two kids I rarely get beyond the sofa these days but I decided that it was a good idea at 2pm to start drinking Sambuca. I remember Stokes’ century on the pub TV and have a hazy recollection of toasting the win with more Sambuca. We apparently ended up at a party hosted by Basement Jaxx where I fell over in the middle of everyone and broke my finger. I somehow made it home and my wife found me asleep on the kitchen floor next morning.” A contribution every bit as vital as that of Stokes and Leach, and I’m not even joking.

Hogan said that to “the best of my knowledge and ability I believe that I complied with public health regulations in Ireland during my visit”.He handed in 20 pages of documents to the head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, after she requested further details of his trip home to Ireland earlier this month.Hogan stated that he played golf in Adare, County Limerick before returning to Kilkenny on 13 August – a day before his 14-day isolation period was due to end.He however stated that he was tested negative for Covid-19 while in hospital on 5 August and claimed that therefore ended the self-restriction period.Discrimination, housing and the impact of Covid-19 are among the top priorities for India’s new National Council for Transgender Persons, two trans members said on Tuesday.India is seen as a global leader for its efforts to improve the lives of an estimated 2 million trans people, who face prejudice in the largely conservative country and survive mostly through begging, performing at weddings or selling sex.“One point that runs as a spinal cord in all of this is stigma and discrimination,” said Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, one of India’s highest profile trans leaders and a member of the council, which she described as “historic”.Trans people are often denied access to jobs, education and healthcare – three areas that Tripathi, a founder of the Asia Pacific Transgender Network, highlighted as priorities, along with shelter.The council aims to ensure equality by advising on and monitoring government policies and to “redress the grievances” of trans people, according to a 2019 law to protect trans rights, which provided for its creation.Some hope the council will look at the impact of the new coronavirus on trans people, who have been among those worst hit by India’s months-long lockdown, which halted sex work and weddings and passenger trains – a popular site for begging.“While certain government schemes have helped them, including pension and food ration, others have not reached them,” said Meera Parida, who chairs the All Odisha Third Gender Welfare Trust and a member of the council.India reported the highest number of new coronavirus cases globally for the 18th straight day, remaining well ahead of the US and Brazil, a Reuters tally based on official reporting showed.It took India from the end of January, when the country’s first case was reported, until July to reach around 1.6 million cases, a period when the government imposed a strict lockdown.However, infections have rocketed by a further 1.5 million since the start of August, taking the total to around 3.1 million, behind only Brazil and the US.The rate of new cases in India is increasing rapidly, climbing by 60,975 in the latest 24-hour period, according to the federal health ministry.“If we cross the absolute numbers (in Brazil and the United States), I won’t be surprised, but we also have a larger population,” Giridhar Babu, epidemiologist at the non-profit Public Health Foundation of India, told Reuters.India reported its first Covid-19 fatality in mid-March, with the death toll rising to around 35,700 by the end of July. In August so far, around 22,600 deaths have been recorded. Deaths are considered a lagging indicator, given the two-week incubation period of the disease.The former Formula 1 team boss and Italian businessman Flavio Briatore has been hospitalised, in Milan after contracting coronavirus. Briatore, owner of the Sardinian Billlionaire’s nightclub, has been taken to the San Raffaele hospital, in the Lombardy capital, where his condition is ”serious”, according to the Italian magazine l’Espresso.A few days ago, Briatore attacked the Italian government, which, in mid-August, introduced a decree imposing the closure of all discotheques in Italy due to the increase in new cases of Covid-19. “This new decree was written by a madman”, Briatore said. A few days later, more than 50 people tested positive for Covid-19 at Billionaire’s, including Briatore.Meanwhile, the former footballer and coach of the Seria A Bologna team, Sinisa Mihajlović, has also tested positive. Mihajlović had socialised with Briatore in Sardinia a few days before.On 12 August, Briatore met the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his house, on the Costa Smeralda in Sardinia. “I came to visit my friend, the president: I love him so much and find him in good shape. Bravo Silvio,” Briatore said in a short video posted on Instagram.Turkey’s coronavirus tracking app is under fire from privacy advocates for adding a feature allowing users to report social distancing rule violations, with the option to send photos, AFP reports.Critics say the function breaches civil liberties and promotes a “culture of denunciation”. Turkish officials counter that the measure is needed to save lives and does not violate laws protecting inidual rights.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said the health ministry’s entire pandemic tracking system - which includes the app - made “us even stronger against the virus”.In April, the health ministry launched a phone app called “Hayat Eve Sigar” (Life Fits Into Home) that helps people monitor confirmed virus cases, showing the risk levels and infection rates in specific neighbourhoods.It also offers information about nearby hospitals, pharmacies, supermarkets and public transport stops.One of its latest features, added this week, allows users to report rule violations in places such as restaurants and cafes, with an ultimate goal of helping control the spread of the virus, which has claimed over 6,000 lives in Turkey.“Help control the virus by reporting rule violations that you encounter,” a message on the app says above an “add photo” function and a line for the corresponding street address.Critics see the new feature as a threat that exposes Turks to government agencies without their consent and makes people feel unsafe.“This system lacks credibility,” said Faruk Cayir, a lawyer and president of Turkey’s Alternative Informatics Association on cyber rights and online censorship.He told AFP the information stored in the app was being shared with other government agencies, including the interior ministry and even private travel companies:The health ministry has not clearly said how long it will be storing data. It only said it was limited to the pandemic period. It has not provided a precise deadline.Cayir argued that reporting violations with photos “would encourage a culture of denunciation, the examples of which have already been seen in Turkey”.Turkey has officially registered almost 260,000 virus infections and 6,139 deaths. The number of daily new cases went up above 1,000 in early August and has yet to go back down.The health ministry developed the app in cooperation with the Turkey’s mobile phone operators and the government’s Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK).Turks are advised to download the app so that security forces are informed when infected people leave their homes in defiance of warnings, with the possibility of criminal prosecution.Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International’s Turkey researcher, said the pandemic was confronting governments with difficult choices.“Governments have an obligation to protect people’s health. This is a human rights issue,” Gardner told AFP.It has also been used as an excuse by governments around the world to take away people’s rights or increase their own powers.He said maintaining social distancing rules was important to prevent the spread and protect people’s health.It’s much better that the authorities address these issues instead of people taking the law into their own hands.There should be a way to ensure that people’s health is protected and protect people’s privacy and security at the same time.Guidance saying that face coverings are not required in England’s schools could be altered if the medical advice changed, according to Boris Johnson.On the issue of whether or not to wear masks in some contexts – you know, we’ll look at the the changing medical evidence as we go on. If we need to change the advice then of course we will.Asked why the UK government was ignoring the World Health Organization’s advice that children over 12 should wear masks, Johnson said: The overwhelming priority is to get all pupils into school. And I think that the schools, the teachers, they’ve all done a fantastic job of getting ready and the risk to children’s health, the risk to children’s wellbeing from not being in school is far greater than the risk from Covid.If there are things we have to do to vary the advice on medical grounds, we will, of course, do that. But as the chief medical officer, all our scientific advisers, have said, schools are safe.It comes as Scotland announced that all secondary school pupils over the age of 12 should wear face coverings on school buses, in corridors and in communal areas from Monday, and the Welsh government pledged to review its own guidance on whether children should wear face coverings in schools.The PM added he was “really pleased” by the work teachers had done to get ready to reopen from next week, a test of his government after it failed to return all children to schools earlier this year.Johnson, whose Conservative government has come under fire for how it has tackled education during the coronavirus crisis, said it was “crucial” for all children to return to school.For more updates from the UK, head over to the UK coronavirus live blog:A lockdown took hold in Gaza on Tuesday after confirmation of the first cases of Covid-19 in the general population of the Palestinian enclave, whose restricted borders have spared it from wide infection.Reuters reports that health authorities in the Hamas Islamist-run territory of 2 million people are concerned over the potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely populated refugee camps and limited hospital facilities in dealing with an outbreak.A government spokesman said four cases of the coronavirus were confirmed in a single family in a refugee camp, the first in Gaza that did not involve people quarantined in border facilities after crossing into the coastal enclave from Egypt and Israel.Citing security concerns, both Egypt and Israel maintain tight restrictions at the Gaza frontier, leaving Gazans with little access to the outside world for years and hospitals often complaining of shortages in medical supplies.“What happens if one of us gets infected?” asked Khaled Sami, a Gaza resident. “When people are seriously ill, they send them into Israel, the West Bank or Egypt. Everything is closed now and who is going to open the gate for someone suffering from the coronavirus?”With businesses, schools and mosques ordered shuttered late on Monday for at least 48 hours, Gaza’s streets were largely deserted. But some people scrambled to buy essentials in groceries and bakeries, a limited number of which were open.“I hope the whole world can now help Gaza. We can’t resolve this issue on our own,” said another Gaza resident, who asked to be identified only as Abu Ahmed.Despite the lockdown, hundreds attended the funeral of four Islamic Jihad gunmen who died in an explosion in Gaza on Monday. The cause of the blast was not immediately disclosed.But in many places, only the sounds of home generators, used to make up for power cuts that can stretch up to 20 hours a day, could be heard.The health crisis came amid heightened tensions fuelled by the launching of sporadic rocket attacks and incendiary balloons at Israel, which has responded with airstrikes against Hamas positions.Gaza’s health ministry said the four Covid-19 cases were uncovered after a woman travelled to the West Bank, where she tested positive.The ministry said there have been 110 cases of the coronavirus inside border quarantine facilities and one death since the world pandemic began.Last month, the Gaza director of the World Health Organization, Abdelnaser Soboh, said the territory’s health system could deal with only 500 positive cases at one time. “A rapid turn for the better in the pandemic situation is unfortunately not in sight,” chief executive Topi Manner said in a statement.“Our revenue has decreased considerably, and that is why we simply must adjust our costs to our new size.”The job cuts will not apply to cabin and flight deck crew, Finnair said, although flying staff will remain on furlough “until further notice”.The vast majority of the airline’s 6,700 employees are on temporary layoffs.Alongside job cuts, the carrier will make other structural changes and on Tuesday updated its savings target from 80 million euros ($94m) to €100m.The company has been particularly hard hit by the drop-off in long-haul traffic, with flights between Helsinki and Asia a key part of the group’s growth strategy this past decade.The carrier released €500m-worth of shares in June to boost liquidity.Finland’s government further tightened coronavirus travel restrictions last week to become what it called the strictest in the EU, banning tourists from all but a handful of member states.Researchers tested 2,153 people in the southern town of Bad Feilnbach between 23 June and 4 July and found about 2.6 times more infections than previously reported. The town had to evacuate a nursing home for elderly people during the outbreak.Some people with Covid-19 are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms, so antibody tests can help establish the true prevalence of the disease.The research is part of an ongoing study in towns in Germany, and the RKI said it would wait for further results before drawing broader conclusions.Germany has managed to keep the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths relatively low compared with some other large European countries, but the number of new daily cases has been rising steadily since early July and has accelerated in recent weeks.The number of confirmed cases in Germany increased by 1,278 to 234,853, data from the RKI showed on Tuesday, while the reported death toll rose by five to 9,277.“The current developments should be taken seriously,” RKI epidemiologist Osamah Hamouda told the news conference, adding that the region near Bad Feilnbach had seen a jump in cases connected with people returning from trips abroad. The Spanish city of Zaragoza is believed to be the first in the country to have deployed a quarantine patrol, a team of 12 people who carry out home visits to make sure people are keeping quarantine.The north-eastern city is the regional capital of Aragon, where cases have surged in recent weeks. The 14-day rate of new infections sits at 441 per 100,000 in the region, according to the most recent data from Spain’s health ministry.The patrols, carried out in teams of two that include one social worker, were launched earlier this month. So far they’ve visited more than 100 homes, ferreting out more than a dozen cases where people have skipped out on quarantine.“We always get a nice welcome, they invite you in and everything,” one member of the team, Virginia Guillén, told Spanish newspaper El País. Working in tandem with health authorities, the team visits homes where people have been hard to track down by phone after testing positive or where there are concerns that quarantine may not be observed.The goal is to not impose controls, added Guillén, “but rather to check on why we someone has not been reached by phone and explain to them that we are here if they need anything.”Along with reinforcing the measures that must be put in place to protect family members from the virus, the patrols ensure that the home is large enough to allow for self-isolation. If not, residents are reminded that alternative accommodation is available to house asymptomatic cases.Two European patients were confirmed to have been re-infected with the coronavirus, according to regional public broadcasters, raising concerns about immunity.The news follows a report this week by researchers in Hong Kong about a man there who had been re-infected four and a half months after recovering.Broadcasters said on Tuesday a patient in the Netherlands and another in Belgium had also been re-infected with the virus.Dutch broadcaster NOS cited virologist Marion Koopmans as saying the patient in the Netherlands was an older person with a weakened immune system. “That someone would pop up with a re-infection, it doesn’t make me nervous,” she said. “We have to see whether it happens often.”Good morning from London.

Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work – your comments are always welcome!In the UK, a leading member of the Oxford University team trying to find a vaccine for coronavirus has not ruled it out being ready for this winter.The trials ongoing around the world hope to involve around 50,000 people and he said if cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials they could present data to regulators this year.It comes after the chief medical officer for England, Chris Witty, suggested that a vaccine would most reasonably be ready next winter or in the one after.Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity at Oxford University, said: I think Chris Witty is right to be cautious, it could take as long as that to demonstrate that the vaccine works and is safe and then we have to go through a process of regulators looking at that to make sure it is done correctly. But if cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials we could have data to put before regulators this year. The potential vaccine, developed by Oxford University and drug company AstraZeneca, is thought to be the most advanced candidate in clinical trials. It is being tested on 10,000 people in the UK, and a further 10,000 in Brazil and South Africa. Scientists also hope to enrol 30,000 people in US trials.Following reports that US president Donald Trump wants to speed up approval of the vaccine in time for the November election, AstraZeneca said it had not discussed any fast-tracking with regulators."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337504.1598276476!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"back to school blues get pupils ready for classroom changes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMany children are likely to feel anxious about returning to school after six months out of the classroom. Photograph: iStockCrisp new shirts, smudge-free copies and a belly full of butterflies are the key ingredients for that first day back to school.This year, however, there will be an additional component behind the excitement of the new school year. For many, both parent and child, this day may now include an additional pinch of anxiety.While there are still unknowns about the logistics of school reopening, there are many ways in which parents can prepare their child for the return to the classroom.School is a very social space and it is important that children are reintroduced to socialising with other children before they return.Nóirín Hayes, expert in early childhood education at Trinity College, says children may become overwhelmed with the social aspect of school when they return if they have not met friends since March.“I certainly would encourage play dates within the boundaries of the guidelines because socialising on Zoom calls and social media is a bit different,” says Hayes.“Organise play dates with the other children from your child’s class so that the children are getting reacquainted with each other,” says Marian Quinn, chief executive of the Childhood Development Initiative. “If you are not happy to have children in your home then go the park so that your child is seeing other children and has the opportunity to play with other children in the playground.”Many children will have spent a lot of time in close proximity to their parents and it will be important for them to begin to spend some time apart from their parents before they return to school.“We know that there are lots of children who have not left their parents’ side for months,” says Quinn. “So, for those, there is going to be a real concern about separation anxiety.”This anxiety is as much a concern for the parent as it is for the child. “Some parents I know have relished the opportunity to be at home with the little ones in a way that they would never have been able to do, so they are going to miss being with their child every day,” says Quinn.She recommends having time apart from your child if possible. “Start looking to see if your child can go and stay with a friend for an hour. Gently start to have some time apart.”2. Talk the talkNever before has the topic of “back to school” been so robustly discussed and by so many, but including the children in the conversation can help ease any concerns they may have.“As parents what we need to do is talk to them about all the positives and the great things that will be there when they return to school, or indeed if it is their first time,” says Quinn.It is also important to be mindful of the conversations you may be having around the children.“Even if the children aren’t involved in the conversation, they are listening and they pick up on things like tone and body language in a way that we often underestimate in children,” says Quinn.“Children will pick up if we are anxious about them returning to school from the conversations that we have.”Clodagh Carroll, assistant director of children’s services at Barnardos, suggests suggests talking to your child about what may be different and acknowledging the worries they may have.“Talking to them and helping them understand that things that might be different will help,” says Carroll, “let them know it is okay for them to have worries and how they can talk to you about them.”3. Walk the walkWhether it is your child’s first day at primary school or they are returning for another year, walking the route to school before they return can help prepare them (and you) and ease the first day nerves.“Before they go back to school do the route with them,” says Carroll, “Little rituals like buying the lunch box or school bag signify a positive about getting ready to go back to school.”Hayes suggests looking at photos of the school or classroom on the school website and talking about the logistics of where they might stand in line.“Attending to the physical realities and the physical health and safety is something that we can all relate to,” says Hayes.4. Trust the teachers“What we have to do is trust our professionals to be professional and do the job that they were trained to do,” says Quinn.If you have noticed any concerning behaviour or are worried about a developmental delay, it is important to communicate this with the class teacher promptly.“Let the school know. It is so much easier for them if they know in advance,” she says.Some parents may be concerned about the re-emergence of school-refusal behaviours.“If you’re worried about school refusal, link in with the school as soon as you can and flag it,” says Carroll. “Find a teacher that had a good relationship with your child to encourage them back. Connect your child back in with that teacher before school starts to relieve that stress and anxiety.”Many parents may have concerns about children’s need to “catch up” academically, but Hayes explains that the first month of school should be viewed differently this time around.“We need to allow children time and space,” says Hayes “Of course children will be expecting to be learning things and to be taught but there needs to be a certain flexibility. Parents shouldn’t be disturbed if their children aren’t coming home with the same level of homework. It is no harm to think about the first month as a settling-in period.”While the return to school may go more smoothly than expected, Hayes says it is important for parents and teachers to be aware that issues may not present themselves straight away.“For many children there really is just the excitement of going back,” says Hayes. “So the issues may not happen in the transition.”She says it is important for parents to be mindful of changes in behaviour or sleep patterns that may happen in the weeks that follow the initial back-to-school period.“Self-care as a parent is one of the things that helps us be as good a parent as we can be,” says Quinn. “Being good to myself is not a selfish act.”She explains that it is really important for parents to take time for themselves. “It is what enables me to be the best parent I can be.”Carroll says it is important for parents to acknowledge how hard this has been for them. “There is something about parents saying “It’s okay, I did my best.”Back to school nerves?

Photograph: iStock“It is constantly in my head. It is a very anxious time,” says Tomas (to protect his identity we are not using his real name), a 60-year-old secondary school teacher ordered to return to work next week despite having cancer and a heart condition, which leave him at high risk of contracting Covid-19.Last week, he filled out the online risk assessment for returning to school, which he believed, because of his renal carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer for which he had part of his kidney removed last year, and his angioplasty and stent insertion, would allow him to work from home.As part of the process, he was asked for an up-to-date report from his consultant.“Let’s just say he’d prefer if I didn’t return to the workplace,” he said.Just days later a report was emailed back to him stating that he was simply “high risk” and not “very high risk”, so he would be expected at his desk when the school gates reopened.The only advice was to socially distance and take the appropriate hygiene measures.Bolt from blue“It was a bolt out of the blue, considering my conditions,” he said. “I do want to go back to work sometime but I don’t feel now is the appropriate time.”A teacher for 40 years, Tomas has been cocooning to protect himself at home since the start of the pandemic. His wife and two children, with whom he lives, have also been limiting their social contacts because of his illnesses.With his medical conditions, he has been “paranoid, anxious and cautious” about coronavirus.Now, faced with having to mix with large groups of children and adults in his school, where “space is very much limited”, he says a “plethora of worries” are weighing on him.“It’s not safe at the moment,” he said.“I’m particularly worried about the areas in the school that become congested at times.‘Lax with time’“I know we’ll all be very careful at the start, but people will get more lax in time. Kids are kids, and they have to be kids.”Break times are another concern, he says, adding that he is worried about the impact the stress will have on his ability to focus on his teaching.“Normally, when you go to work you just worry about work – now I have this other worry hovering over my head.“It seems to be a fait accompli.“My worst fear is that I will contract Covid and all the risks that go with that, even developing another serious illness from contracting it. From the information we have at the moment, you could be knocked out for months and no one knows the long-term effects of the disease.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4338476.1598358837!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 teachers call for face masks to be worn by children aged over six","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents with face masks enter their classroom at the Petri primary school in Dortmund,  Germany. Face masks are not required in Irish primary schools. Photograph: Ina FassbenderAFPTeachers have called for an urgent review of rules which exempt primary schoolchildren from wearing face masks in light of new international health guidance aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19.The World Health Organisation has issued updated recommendations which say children aged between six and 11 should wear face masks on a “risk-based approach”.The WHO’s says this guidance is subject to a number of factors including the intensity of transmission in an area, the child’s ability to use the mask, access to masks and adequate adult supervision.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) said on Tuesday that it has written to Taoiseach Micheál Martin seeking clarity on the public health guidance relating to primary and special schools It has called on the Government to “urgently review” guidelines in relation to children wearing face coverings.“The union was promised in June that this guidance would be ‘updated to reflect the changing situation’ in the context of Covid-19 epidemiology in Ireland, and a review was also promised in light of the experience of other jurisdictions whose schools reopened in May and June,” it said. The INTO said it sought clarity three weeks ago from Minister for Education Norma Foley and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly in relation to the wearing of face coverings and the approach to be taken in the event that a pupil or staff member tests positive for Covid-19.Testing access“INTO has reminded An Taoiseach that as 100 children have tested positive in the last fortnight it is vital that priority access to testing and tracing be made available to everyone in the education sector,” it said.The union also restated a call for priority access to testing must to be made available to any asymptomatic teacher who requests it. This would help build confidence in the safety of schools as workplaces and address the reasonable concerns of many of its members, the union said. “Prolonged absences from schools awaiting tests benefit no one,” it said.The INTO also said it was aware of a number of members whose health was at “high risk” and who have multiple underlying conditions. In what the union said was a “ grossly unfair move”, the teachers’ occupational health service, Medmark has advised that members with such conditions should return to school. “INTO is now calling on government to intervene so that these members can appeal their Medmark decisions in a timely manner and have the opinion of their treating doctors fully taken into account rather than the Department simply adopting the view, often delivered remotely and facelessly, of the Department of Education’s health adviser,” it said.“As our members return to the front lines this week, urgent and swift action from government is now required to review existing public health guidance and ensure it remains fit for purpose.” Duty of careThe union added that parents were owed a duty of care by the government. It said the employers should be instructed by the Government to provide flexibility for parents in their workplace, as they may need to take swift action to remove their child from the school or keep their child home where they are exhibiting symptoms of the virus. Ms Foley, meanwhile, has said parents can be assured that schools are taking all necessary precautions to ensure children will return to “safe and welcoming” classrooms.She said enormous work is being undertaken in school communities to provide a safe environment for the return of children to schools.“For parents, I understand that you may feel anxious about your child’s return to school,” she said.“We are living in a new normal. However, we have put in place all the precautions necessary and along with the dedication of the principals and teachers at a local school level, you can be assured that your child will return to a safe and welcoming classroom.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Diesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows\u0026lsquoStaggering\u0026rsquo study indicates sea level rises could reach a metre by the end of the centuryOne Change: We need to rethink the value we place on the natural environment"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The initial impact of Brexit was two price hikes of 10 per cent each, both caused by a fall in the sterling to euro exchange rate.But the impact on sales was virtually zero and a World Trade Organisation tariff of 7 per cent, which will apply to Silverhill goods entering the UK without a UKEU trade deal, doesn’t faze the company’s head of sales, Barry Cullen.“It’s not a major price difference,” he says. “We are a premium product. We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Nick BradshawA timeline outlining European Commissioner Phil Hogan’s movements during a recent trip to Ireland has been published as he attempts to fend off calls to resign over his attendance at an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner.He told the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen that he did not breach the terms of the lockdown in Kildare because his travel in and out of the country was covered by the “reasonable excuse” provision of the public health regulations.However, it appears Mr Hogan may not have complied with advice which says people arriving in the State to quarantine for 14 days even if they have tested negative for Covid-19. “To my best understanding, my justification for entering County Kildare to obtain essential working documents or to get my belongings for the purpose of returning home to Brussels constitutes ‘a reasonable excuse’ under the regulations,” he says in a memorandum concerning his movements and attendance at the golf dinner supplied to Dr von der Leyen’s office this afternoon.“At all times during my brief presence in Kildare over the period, I followed public health guidance.“When in Kildare, I was either moving through the county or momentarily there with a reasonable excuse and consequently I was not in breach of the Covid-19 restrictions imposed.“To the best of my knowledge and ability I believe that I complied with public health regulations in Ireland during my visit.”Mr Hogan has been under pressure since he attended a meal at a hotel in Clifden, Co Galway last week, at which more than 80 people gathered in apparent breach of public health guidelines. The timelines states that he played golf on three occasions between August 13th and August 19th. QuarantineRegarding his observance of the quarantine requirements, Mr Hogan said that he had tested negative for Covid-19 while in hospital for a medical procedure and therefore was not “under any subsequent legal requirement to self-isolate or quarantine”.When contacted by the  on Tuesday, the HSE Live Coronavirus information line said that incoming travellers must self-isolate for 14 days regardless of any negative test result as the disease could still be incubating at the time the test is taken. “A test is only a point in time,” the adviser explained. “So I’m afraid the 14 day (quarantine period) still stands regardless of test negative or not.”The commissioner cited a section of the ‘Testing for Covid-19’ page from the Citizens Information website in his dossier, which applies to ordinary residents in the State. This page contains advice for those who suspect they have Covid-19 and explains the procedure for getting a test. It advises anyone with symptoms to isolate for 14 days. “If you have tested negative for Covid-19, you will receive your results by text message. You do not have to self-isolate any longer”.However, the advice for incoming travellers from the Citizens Information web page on ‘Returning to Ireland and Covid-19’ says incoming travellers should “only stop self-isolating after 14 days have passed and you have had no symptoms.” By travelling to Adare in Limerick to play golf on August 13th, Mr Hogan would appear to have breached this advice.Tightened restrictionsMr Hogan also says that the Oireachtas golf dinner was not covered by the tightened restrictions - reducing the numbers permissible at an indoor event to 15 - announced on August 18th because the statutory instrument giving effect to the change was not made available until after the dinner on August 19th.“In reality this means that the dinner did not come within the remit of the new rules agreed on 18 August,” he says.He says he was “assured by the organisers and the hotel that it was being held in full compliance with all relevant Covid-19 rules”. “I had no reason to question or doubt that assurance, particularly in circumstances where an Irish Government Minister was attending and speaking at the event. Again I now recognize that the event should not have proceeded and I should not have attended,” he says. Mr Hogan’s response indicates that he will attempt to tough it out in the face of calls in Ireland to resign. His account of the matters is now being considered by the office of Dr von der Leyen.The timeline also states that Mr Hogan played golf in Co Limerick on August 13th. He said he collected documents from his Co Kildare apartment on August 17th ahead of going to Clifden for the golf gathering. It says he played golf the day before the dinner and on the day of the gathering itself. The Government and the European Commission have suggested that Mr Hogan should take questions in public to account for his actions, but he has yet to do so.The dossier submitted by Mr Hogan included details on the local coronavirus restrictions in different counties, advice from the Irish Hotels Federation, and a map of Ireland.The Government is awaiting the judgment of Dr von der Leyen on the dossier supplied by Mr Hogan to her office. Sources said there is particular focus on whether Mr Hogan violated the terms of the local lockdown in Kildare.Proven incorrectInitial statements provided by his spokesman claiming Mr Hogan travelled “directly” from Co Kilkenny to the event in Co Galway have since proven to be incorrect. Mr Hogan’s team has said that he returned to Co Kildare, where local lockdown measures are in place, on his way to the golf event to collect items from his residence at the K-Club. He was stopped by gardaí in the county for using his mobile phone while driving.Dr von der Leyen then requested further details and clarification from the commissioner because “she wishes to be informed in detail about the facts, but she also wishes to understand the circumstances, she wishes simply to have the complete picture.”Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan discussed the controvery surrounding Mr Hogan and the golfing society dinner on Tuesday morning. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien has called for Mr Hogan to resign, while Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar asked him to consider his position.European Commission spokeswoman Dana Spinant said it was “premature” to discuss any potential sanctions on the commissioner and whether Dr von der Leyen could ask him to resign.‘Zero comment’The owner of the hotel that hosted the controversial dinner, to mark the golfing society’s 50th anniversary, has said he will be making “zero comment” on the debacle. Galway businessman John Sweeney, who owns the Station House Hotel, said he was “saying absolutely nothing” in response to the political storm that has erupted over the event. “At the appropriate time the hotel will have something to say,” he told The . Mr Sweeney is a well-known Galway businessman and hotelier, and he was part of a consortium that previously acquired Dublin’s five-star Shelbourne Hotel in 2004. However, his business interests were severely hit during the economic crash. His name was listed on the seating plan for the dinner, and other guests included Fianna Fáil TD Dara Calleary, who resigned as minister for agriculture over the controversy Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe and a host of former and sitting Oireachtas members – predominantly from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. The three-course dinner rounded off two days of golf at Connemara Golf Club in Ballyconneely. There had been a ider in place splitting the function room, and the ider was pulled back during a series of speeches at the event.Previous limits allowing up to 50 people to attend indoor gatherings had been reduced to just six people as part of measures announced by the Government in response to a rise in Covid-19 cases the day before the dinner.

File photograph: Nick BradshawThe EU commissioner Phil Hogan has been at the centre of a major political controversy, as one of several high-profile politicians who attended an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner last week that had more than 80 guests, in apparent breach of public health guidelines amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He is facing calls to resign and scrutiny over his account of his movements after arriving back in Ireland. Here is the timeline of his role in the controversy: July 30th: European Commissioner for Trade Phil Hogan arrived in Ireland from Brussels. Earlier that day he had a video call on trade reform and US-China relations, according to his diary. Under public health guidelines, people arriving into Ireland from non-green-list countries, such as Belgium, must restrict their movements for 14 days. HSE advice outlines that this means “avoiding contact with other people and social situations as much as possible”. After arriving in Ireland Mr Hogan was self-isolating at a residence he owns at the K Club, in Straffan, Co Kildare. August 5th: Mr Hogan travelled to Dublin for a medical appointment, and stayed in a health facility overnight, where he was also tested for Covid-19 and received a negative result.After his stay in the Dublin medical clinic he travelled to stay with a family member in Kilkenny for a period of convalescence. August 8th: Following a spike in coronavirus cases linked to several outbreaks, counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly were put into an effective lockdown by the Government for two weeks. The new restrictions meant people in the three counties would be allowed to travel only within their county, unless for work, medical, or family reasons. People who had to pass through the affected counties were asked not to stop while travelling through the area. Public health rules for the rest of the country at this point restricted numbers attending indoor gatherings, such as weddings or other functions, to a strict limit of 50 people. August 18th: Last Tuesday the Oireachtas Golf Society two-day 50th anniversary event kicked off at Connemara Championship Golf Links, Ballyconneely, Co Galway. Tee times for the captain’s prize four-ball began from 11am. As the politicians and other attendees at the event were making their way around the 18 holes of the championship links course, a lengthy Cabinet meeting was under way that afternoon.Shortly before 6pm in Dublin, Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced public health restrictions were being tightened, to combat the recent increase in Covid-19 cases in the State. The new measures included a limit for indoor gatherings of six people. August 19th: The second day of the event started with another round of golf for the president’s prize, followed that evening by dinner at the Station House Hotel, in Clifden, at 8.30pm. Mr Hogan was seated at the top table, with society captain Noel Grealish TD, Mr Calleary and his wife Siobhan, and former Fianna Fáil minister Noel Dempsey and his wife Bernadette, according to the seating plan. August 20th: At 7pm the Irish Examiner broke the story of the dinner online under the headline: “Minister and 80 people at golf event in breach of public health guidelines.” August 21st: The political and public outrage was swift, with several resignations on Friday morning amid the backlash. Mr Calleary resigned as minister for agriculture, Senator Jerry Buttimer resigned as leas-chathaoirleach of the Seanad. The party whip was also removed from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Senators who attended. At 10.58am Mr Hogan released his first statement addressing his attendance at the golf society dinner.The former Fine Gael minister said he had attended it “on the clear understanding that the organisers and the hotel concerned had been assured by the Irish Hotels Federation that the arrangements proposed to be put in place would be in compliance with the Government’s guidelines”.He added that he had “complied fully with the Government’s quarantine requirements, having been in Ireland since late July”.Mr Hogan’s team began to field press queries digging into the commissioner’s movements between his return from Brussels in late July and the golf event, based on questions about whether he had spent time in Co Kildare. A spokesman for Mr Hogan told The  at about 11.30am: “I’m not going to get into details of the commissioner’s personal movements, other than to assure you that he did not breach the lockdown rules to attend the golf event.”Later another statement from his spokesman clarified that Mr Hogan “fulfilled quarantineself-isolation requirements in accordance with Government requirements following his return to Ireland at the end of July. I can confirm that he did not breach Government guidelines relating to Co Kildare.”Following continued pressure, Mr Hogan’s spokesman released a further statement detailing his movements upon arriving in Ireland. “Mr Hogan left Kildare to fulfil a medical appointment prior to the implementation of the lockdown and went from there to Kilkenny for a period of convalescence and then went to Connemara for the golf tournament.Speaking on RTÉ’s Six One News, Mr Martin said he believed Mr Hogan should apologise for attending the dinner. “I would like a meaningful response to the mood of the public and the anger of the public towards this issue,” he said.Following this intervention, Mr Hogan released a statement clarifying he “does apologise for any distress caused by his attendance” at the dinner. Shortly afterwards his spokesman sent out a revised statement which said that Mr Hogan apologised for his attendance, with the reference to “any distress caused” removed.August 22nd: Mr Hogan returned to Brussels on Saturday. In a statement that evening, both Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar said they had asked him to “consider his position” as EU commissioner over the debacle. August 23rd: Despite continuing pressure, Mr Hogan’s spokesman reiterated that the commissioner would not be resigning from his post. At 12.20pm Mr Hogan released a furtherlengthy further statement, apologising “fully and unreservedly” for attending the dinner. “I acknowledge my actions have touched a nerve for the people of Ireland, something for which I am profoundly sorry. I realise fully the unnecessary stress, risk and offence caused to the people of Ireland by my attendance at such an event, at such a difficult time for all, and I am extremely sorry for this,” he said. There was another significant development in the story just after 9pm. It transpired that Mr Hogan had been stopped by a garda for using his mobile phone while driving to the golf society event. He had been stopped while in Co Kildare – a county under lockdown – while en route from Kilkenny to Clifden on August 17th. The new revelations called into question previous statements emphatically denying he had breached restrictions in Co Kildare. Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne show, Mr Martin said he would be concerned if Mr Hogan had breached the lockdown restrictions in Co Kildare. The Taoiseach said he would like a “very comprehensive statement” from Mr Hogan to explain fully his position in relation to the restrictions in Co Kildare. In Brussels, Mr Hogan presented a report on the controversy to president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, who is considering the matter, and, crucially, has the power to remove him from office. August 25th: It emerged on August 25th that Mr Hogan played golf in Co Limerick on August 13th."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Researchers say man had no Covid-19 symptoms the second time, suggesting immune system kept virus somewhat in checkLocals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  Kirill KudryavtsevAFP via Getty ImagesAs Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent dissident, fought for his life in a Siberian hospital after apparently being poisoned last week, three masked men occupied the chief doctor’s office.Idling under a portrait of President Vladimir Putin pensively strolling through a field of wheat, the men made small talk but refused to say who they were.Their awkward dress and shifty demeanour were all too familiar to Navalny’s family and aides, who quickly recognised them as members of the Russian security services.“It looks really funny – you can tell because they’re these tough-looking, well-built men, and they usually have these manbags,” said Ivan Zhdanov, director of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation.The pervasive surveillance against Navalny, who was in Siberia making one of his YouTube corruption investigations, indicates how he remains a thorn in the Kremlin’s side after a decade of activism.Navalny, who has been jailed 13 times for organising protests against Putin, complained to the Financial Times in an interview last year that he and his family were followed around the clock by men he claimed were from Russia’s security services.“It’s been going on for quite some time, but I’d be lying if I told you it was routine and we don’t pay attention to it. Some assholes are sitting next to you all the time. But you don’t stop living your life,” he said. “Lots of people’s reaction to that would be to shut down and hide ... We enjoy our lives as we can.”Aides who accompanied Navalny on the Siberia trip and kept watch at the hospital in Omsk said they had long grown used to being followed by unmarked cars and spotting men trying to hide video cameras.“We know they constantly listen to our phone conversations, we know they put up hidden cameras, we know they take the footage from security cameras everywhere we go,” Zhdanov said. “They interrogated my relatives, everyone I had meetings with – it’s more or less total control.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that surveillance operations were “the prerogative of the secret services” and “cannot and should not be approved” by Putin’s administration.KompromatThe surveillance appears to date at least as far back as 2017, when Navalny began travelling across Russia in an attempt to challenge Putin for president.That year, Ren-TV, a channel whose parent company is reportedly co-owned by close Putin confidant Yuri Kovalchuk, aired a documentary accusing Navalny of receiving secret cash payments from “fugitive oligarchs”. The film used surveillance videos of Navalny on vacation with his family, intercepted phone calls, text messages, and emails, and trailed his employees in cafés.Dmitry Belousov, a former Ren-TV scriptwriter now seeking asylum in the Netherlands, told the FT he believed the secret services had passed on the footage – known in industry jargon as kompromat, for “compromising materials” – to discredit Navalny and other activists.Belousov said that Alexei Malkov, Ren-TV’s chief political producer, had previously bragged to him that a “handler” from the FSB, the successor agency to the KGB, supplied him with surveillance materials for Kremlin-commissioned state TV documentaries.Malkov uploaded the footage to Ren-TV’s servers himself, leaving Belousov to fill in the blanks in the script while reporters chased Navalny’s team on the street for comments.“He met someone, brought the material, and they were basically the ones making the film,” Belousov said. “Nobody makes those films on their own initiative. Everything is done to order for approval. The Kremlin has a story to tell and the FSB and presidential administration put the show together.”Malkov ultimately quit the channel in disgust after making the next film in the cycle, which included surveillance of several teenage opposition candidates for city councils in provincial Russia. “The FSB is the political police, it’s conducting political surveillance in Russia,” he said. “They find any kompromat, publish it on TV, and then the police start charging these activists with crimes based on nothing.”The Kremlin and the FSB did not respond to a request for comment. Ren-TV told independent investigative site Proekt, which first published Belousov’s story, that Malkov did not take instructions from the Kremlin and said its sources “could be all kinds of structures”.SurveillanceReports in the Russian press indicated the Kremlin was keeping Navalny’s seemingly routine trip to the cities of Novosibirsk and Tomsk on a very tight leash.An article in the pro-Kremlin tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets on Saturday cited “sources in the security structures” who said they had followed Navalny throughout the trip as he took selfies with followers in the town centre, rented what they termed a “conspiratorial apartment” and took a dip in the Tom river.The leak was apparently intended to show that agents could not have poisoned Navalny, claiming they had failed to detect “any superfluous or suspicious contacts”. But the article nevertheless revealed the apparent scale of the surveillance, as officers cross-checked his followers’ credit cards, a sushi delivery order, hotel bookings and followed him in unmarked cars.Proekt said a senior Kremlin official had shown its reporter Navalny’s test results before they were made public and said they showed he was “definitely not poisoned”.“The amount of resources they spend on it is remarkable,” Zhdanov said. He said that on one occasion he and Navalny met a fellow activist in a Moscow café and realised that “each of us had our own surveillance team”.“It was hilarious because there was an enormous number of people around, it was completely blatant. Seven people were within touching distance and more were sitting outside.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Netanyahu says now is not the time to drag the country into an unwanted fourth electionSaudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"british museum removes bust slave owner founder sir hans sloane","story":"The British Museum has removed a bust of its founding father from its pedestal and labelled him a “slave owner” in an attempt to confront its links to colonialism, the institution’s director has announced.Sir Hans Sloane’s likeness has instead been placed in a secure cabinet alongside artefacts that explain his work in the “exploitative context of the British Empire”.The decision was signed off by Hartwig Fischer, the museum director, and revealed in an interview in The Daily  on Monday.“We have pushed him off the pedestal,” Mr Fischer said. “We must not hide anything. Healing is knowledge.”It is part of a wider process of acknowledging the museum’s links to slavery, curators said.Other artefacts, including those taken by Captain James Cook on his voyages, will be given new labels explaining how they were acquired by the museum through “colonial conquest and military looting”. Mr Fischer said: “Dedication to truthfulness when it comes to history is absolutely crucial, with the aim to rewrite our shared, complicated and, at times, very painful history.“The case dedicated to Hans Sloane and his relationship to slavery is a very important step in this.“We have pushed him off the pedestal where nobody looked at him, and placed him in the limelight.“The British Museum has done a lot of work – accelerated and enlarged its work on its own history, the history of empire, the history of colonialism, and also of slavery. These are subjects which need to be addressed, and to be addressed properly. We need to understand our own history.”The decision to revisit Sloane’s past was made during lockdown in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, which sparked debate around statues of controversial historical figures in public spaces. In June, a statue of Edward Colston was removed from its plinth by protesters in Bristol.The Rhodes Must Fall campaign in Oxford also successfully called for the removal of a statue of philanthropist Cecil Rhodes.Neal Spencer, keeper of Nile and Mediterranean objects and the curator behind the new Sloane display, said that “Black Lives Matter provides a certain level of urgency”.He added: “It’s expected of museums today. The collection is owned by the public in the widest sense.“We want to be upfront about Sloane’s collection being at the root of the British Museum. And we want to put it in a wider context, which is obviously a very difficult context.“It happened in the exploitative context of the British Empire. I wouldn’t describe it as an imperialist organisation, but it is a museum that was founded within the context of Empire.“Eventually we’re going to be redisplaying the whole British Museum. We want to tell more of these stories.“We want to talk more about the context of how the museum was founded.”Sloane’s collection of 71,000 artefacts became the starting point of the British Museum after being bequeathed to the state in his will.The Irish-born collector, known for London street names such as Sloane Square, and being the purported inventor of drinking chocolate, also had investments in the slave-trading Royal African and South Sea Companies.These facts are now noted on labels beside his terracotta bust, which is surrounded by tokens of the slave trade and its legacy.A panel beside Sloane’s bust explains that this collection was “enabled by the wealth and networks that grew out of European imperialism”.New labels also state that this bequeathed hoard contained “anatomical specimens relating to skin colour and theories of racial difference”.While the origins of the foundational collection are being examined, a new “trail” for visitors will allow them to move through the museum on a themed tour of 16 objects unjustly taken from far-flung places in the days of Empire.This trail will not include the Parthenon Marbles – also known as the Elgin Marbles – which have long been the subject of demands for repatriation to Greece after being taken from the Acropolis in the early 19th century.Mr Fischer is determined that in the coming years the long-term commitment of the museum to being open about its imperial heritage will lead to an overhaul in the information available to members of the public visiting in future.He said: “This is not just about empire and colonialism, and European expansion across the world in the last 500 years.“It is also setting this in the wider context of human history.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks national interest joe biden wins presidential race","story":"As the United States embarks on what might be its most acrimonious election in living memory, what outcome would be in the interests of the UK? A case can be made that the first term of President Trump has been not too bad from the British point of view. He is warm towards Britain, likes our Prime Minister and is in favour of a free trade deal. His administration has backed us up at some crucial moments, such as over the Salisbury poisonings, or China’s breach of its agreements with us over Hong Kong. He never looks happier abroad, or behaves with more decorum, than when visiting the Queen.These are actions we can appreciate, as are the tireless efforts of American diplomats to keep cooperation with allies on the road. Trump’s inability to keep a team together – with repeated changes of defence secretary, national security adviser and senior intelligence officials – has been damaging, but at lower levels the US system works closely with us every day, sharing valuable intelligence, keeping our militaries aligned and helping with law enforcement.Furthermore, it can be argued, many of Trump’s foreign policy pronouncements are part of a longer-term trend in US thinking. His attitude to China is symptomatic of Washington waking up to the rise of a new strategic adversary. The lectures to allies about paying their own way are an extension of appeals made by Obama, albeit more threatening. And his desire to bring troops home from Syria and Afghanistan is also part of a common American exhaustion after Iraq, even if more erratic and temperamental.So far, so much relief. Trump has not wrecked Nato or blown up the world. Yet we British have to recognise that something is fundamentally wrong. Something vital to us, as a medium-sized, transatlantic, democratic nation, is missing. We need the US to be the active leader of a network of alliances, of which we are a part, and to combine its great financial and physical strength with moral authority and respected global leadership. In the next four years, the need for that leadership will be as vital as it ever has been since the end of the Cold War. No other country can come close to providing it. And we have seen enough now to know that Donald Trump is not going to give it.The Covid-19 crisis has been, as in so many ways, a revelatory moment. Leave aside the chaotic domestic response in America – we have not been in a position to preach, and Europe’s problems are far from over. But the most striking aspect of the crisis has been the absence of any attempt at global leadership. The one person who could have moved other nations and his own to take it seriously, to coordinate policies, to consult on closing borders, share vaccine research, and act to prevent future pandemics, was the US president. The leader who could have summoned the G20, and even now could be ensuring sufficient support for developing countries to prevent a health and economic meltdown with far-reaching consequences, is in the White House.Next year, the UK will host the Cop26, the world conference on climate change. It will be the most crucial such meeting since Paris in 2015, and a decisive moment in seeking agreement from all countries to take necessary action. The Trump administration is uninterested in such issues and even hostile to addressing them. Within the US, it is pushing ahead with the obscenity of drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Internationally, it is unwilling to give the lead that would bring a global agreement within reach.Other issues of vast and lasting importance are coming to a head. Rivalry with China may well be unavoidable, but we need America to be at the centre of strong alliances as it faces up to that, not striking out on its own. Trump’s early decision to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership weakened his own country’s position on international trade, and the value to this country of ultimately joining the pact. More widely on China, Western countries are on the strongest ground when opposing totalitarian behaviour but still seeking a framework of coordination with Beijing on pressing global issues – arms control, climate change, and economic stability. Trump, however, often seems to have this the wrong way round: raising few objections to dictatorship while failing to find a constructive framework.One excruciating extract of the book by the most recently departed national security adviser, John Bolton, recounted how “Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do.” This is part of a pattern: he greeted Xi Jinping becoming president indefinitely with “I think it’s great”, said Kim Jong-Un had “a great and beautiful vision” for his country and has repeatedly raised inviting Putin to the G7, despite the deep discomfort of the leaders of other free nations.At a time when democracies, though resilient, are under the great strains of internal discontent and growing external interference, this disdain for the values of freedom and democracy is deeply damaging to the West. It is amplified by Trump’s unsubstantiated charges of fraudulent voting in his own country, intended to undermine confidence in any unwelcome result. \u2028It is in the vital interests of the UK that America, our indispensable ally, is ironclad and steadfast in its attachment to democracy at home and abroad: the capital and the arsenal of freedom.Last week, 73 former US national security officials who worked under the Reagan and Bush presidencies called on Republicans to forsake their party and vote for Joe Biden. Many British Conservatives, even those of us with decades-long friendships among Republicans, will feel the same. Biden will face his own problems, particularly of how to restrain the Left of his own party. But if he wins, which is by no means certain, he is committed to uphold human rights and democracy, persuade other countries to join the US in more ambitious environmental goals, and “restore a commitment to science and truth in government”. Such an approach would be good for the world and for America. And that means it would be good for Britain.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"petition rule britannia sung last night proms reaches 10000","story":"Some 10,000 people have signed a petition calling for the BBC to fully reinstate Rule, Britannia! into their ‘Proms’ programme, as a cabinet minister said he would “like to see the lyrics sung”.Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary said the Last Night of the Proms brings “a huge amount of pleasure to millions of people” and that if singing is not possible, the BBC should put up subtitles.On Monday night the BBC defied the Government by announcing that Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory will not be sung at this year’s Last Night of the Proms.Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, had warned the BBC not to “erase history” by dropping the songs amid a row over colonialism, while Boris Johnson had told the corporation it was a mistake to target the “symbols” rather than the “substance” of such issues.But the BBC ignored them, effectively censoring the traditional anthems by choosing to play orchestral versions only, with no soloist singing the lyrics. With no audience because of coronavirus restrictions, there will be no-one to sing along to them either.One government source described the decision as “incredible” and signalled that ministers were taken aback by the decision because they had believed the BBC would back down and stick with tradition.On Tuesday morning, Mr Sharma said: “Personally, I would like to see the lyrics sung, and of course it’s always possible to put the lyrics up as subtitles on the screen so people who want to can join in.”He echoed the Prime Minister’s sentiments that “we need to tackle the source of the problem” around racism and colonialism.By Tuesday morning a petition to have the songs played as before, with singing, reached 10,000 signatures.“The singing of two rousing patriotic anthems, Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory, has been part of the programme of The Last Night of the Proms for many years. But their performance is now threatened with cancellation by the forces of political correctness,” says the petition.“The annual singing of these songs on The Last Night of the Proms, which is broadcast on BBC Television, has become a much-cherished ritual,” it adds. “They are sung with pride and sentiment, but also with a degree of joshing humour and wry self-mockery that is characteristically British.”Christopher Silvester, who started the petition told the  this morning: The BBC\u0027s pathetic justification for not having soloists and chorus but only playing orchestral versions of these patriotic songs is, of course, the coronavirus pandemic. And yet they managed to use soloists in their VE Day and VJ Day televised concerts. Indeed, they used a gospel choir in the VJ Day concert. Admittedly those concerts were filmed outdoors, but nonetheless the Albert Hall is perfectly suited to the social distancing of singers and with all the BBC\u0027s expertise in the use of microphones it should be possible to accommodate a reduced chorus. The failure to do this betrays the BBC\u0027s true colours and reveals their political agenda.Michael Fabricant, Conservative MP for Litchfield told BBC Radio 4 this morning: “I think it\u0027s all very sad. “There are some lovely words to Rule, Britannia! You start to talk about ‘Rule, Britannia! and Britain shouldn\u0027t be slaves’, but you\u0027ve got ‘other nations not so blessed as thee must in the turn to tyrants fall. While thou shalt flourish great and free’.

Though its appeal to carriers was a low operating cost per seat, many airlines, especially flag carriers, purchased the 747 due to its prestige. Through the 1980s, Boeing was taking scores of orders for the aircraft every year, and delivering as many as 70 to its customers.The 747 brought air travel to the masses but it also ushered in a new Golden Age of Flying, with additional space allowing for unprecedented comfort and luxury.Though more and more people were able to fly, it was still considered a special occasion, prompting travellers and families to dress up for flights. Aircraft serving the holiday markets of the Caribbean were said to have carnival atmospheres on board.As planned by Boeing, the 747 was long popular with cargo operators thanks to its unobstructed fuselage and vast capacity. It could take off with a payload of up to 970,000lbs.Boeing continued to update the aircraft, stretching and modernising it to make it more fuel efficient. There are five main variants, with different models within each category, including the latest, the 747-8. Nasa still has a 747 in service it used to transport spacecraft, while Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic does the same, launching its aircraft at altitude. The evolution of smaller, more fuel efficient aircraft that are easier to fill, such as Boeing’s own 787 Dreamliner, makes the 747 less attractive to airlines. Today, more cargo operators than passenger airlines fly the aircraft, while orders have all but dried up. "},{"url":null,"title":"putin has no good options belarus","story":"In the six years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, commentators have speculated about what might lead the Kremlin into another military intervention in the eastern part of Europe. What is currently happening in Belarus – large-scale protests against Alexander Lukashenko following rigged presidential elections – has been the most popular bet.Yet, Vladimir Putin – in spite of his well-publicised dislike of public protests – has been hesitant to intervene militarily in the post-Soviet space in response to crises that result from rigged elections and result in large-scale protests. For every Ukraine in 2014, there is Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, Kyrgyzstan in 2005 and 2010, and Armenia in 2018.True, the international order – and Russia’s place (and, perhaps more importantly, its perceived place) within it – has changed significantly since the so-called colour revolutions of 2003-2005, but there are still lessons to be learnt from Russia’s behaviour over the past decade.The situation in Belarus currently resembles that in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia more than it does that in Ukraine. In Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, popular protests emerged in response to rigged parliamentary elections, with the countries’ kleptocractic leaders ousted by movements promising to crack down on corruption. In much the same way, the protests in Belarus appear to be motivated primarily by domestic issues – the rigged presidential election on August 9, as well as widespread discontent with authoritarian leadership.The protests in Ukraine were motivated by domestic issues, including widespread corruption, as well. But they were also motivated by international issues, most obviously former president Viktor Yanukovych’s last-minute decision to back away from signing an Associate Agreement with the European Union in favour of aligning his country more closely with Russia. As a result, the protests in Kyiv – unlike those in Bishkek or Yerevan – were marked by overt pro-Western, pro-European Union, and anti-Russian messages.Such messages are not visible in Minsk, but this has not stopped Lukashenko from playing on Putin’s fears of a colour revolution in Russia. “Defending Belarus today is nothing less than defending all of our space,” Lukashenko said to Putin, according to state news agency Belta. “If Belarusians don’t hold out, this wave will roll over there.” Lukashenko has also invented military threats facing Belarus from NATO, portraying himself as a last bastion for Russia against an increasingly hostile West.For all of this, however, the Kremlin values Belarus more than it does its leader. Russia tried to remove Lukashenko in 2010, and Lukashenko has rarely been a reliable partner for the Kremlin’s geopolitical games. He refused to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008, following Russia’s war with Georgia, and has flip-flopped on Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, maintaining strategic ambiguity ever since.On August 16, when Russia cited the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a military bloc of six former Soviet states who have pledged to defend each other in case of attack, it promised only a “readiness to render the necessary assistance to resolve the challenges facing Belarus” and did not mention Lukashenko by name.Does this mean that Russia will not intervene militarily in Belarus? No. But the Kremlin is unlikely to intervene militarily to keep Lukashenko in power, at least in the long term. Instead, Moscow – amid continuing large-scale protests and a steady trickle of defections from Lukashenko’s government – may be willing to contemplate other options, including a power transition. This would become more likely if the Kremlin sees a figure in the disparate Belarus opposition movement with whom it could work.In fact, it would be surprising if the Kremlin were not already testing the water. It did this in Kyrgyzstan in 2010, cultivating links between the governing United Russia party and the head of Kyrgyzstan’s interim government Roza Otunbayeva, and in Armenia in 2018, establishing contact with opposition figures and settling on Nikol Pashinyan while Serzh Sargsyan was still in office. In doing so, both Otunbayeva and Pashinyan made a point of committing to maintain the geopolitical status quo.In Belarus, this option would likely involve the Kremlin having to convince Lukashenko that retirement in exile is the least bad option for him. It would also likely involve having to share a mediation role with EU member states in any political transition process. But the Kremlin may ultimately deem it worthwhile in order to ensure that its core interests are protected.Dr Andrew Foxall is Director of the Russia and Eurasia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, the London-based international affairs think tankMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ronaldinho released spending five months detention forged passport","story":"Former Brazil football star Ronaldinho was released on Monday by a Paraguayan judge after spending five months in detention over a forged passport.Judge Gustavo Amarilla also released Ronaldinho\u0027s brother Roberto de Assis Moreira, who likewise had been held for a month in jail and another four months under house arrest in a hotel in Paraguay\u0027s capital, Asuncion, for the same charge.The 40-year-old former World Cup winner is free to travel to whatever country in the world he wants but he must inform us if he changes his permanent residence for a period of one year, the judge said.He has no restrictions except for the fulfilment of reparations for damage to society.Dressed in jeans, a black beret and black shirt, Ronaldinho accepted the terms of his release, which include payment of $90,000 in damages. His brother, who is also Ronaldinho\u0027s business manager, must pay $110,000.The judge stressed that he was not issuing a definitive dismissal of the case but rather that Ronaldinho was benefitting from a conditional suspension of the procedure.His brother, on the other hand, was given a two-year suspended sentence.Prosecutors said they did not believe Ronaldinho took part in the plan to manufacture the fake Paraguayan passports but believed de Assis Moreira was aware that the passports were false.They flagrantly used a public document containing false content, said Marcelo Pecci, one of the public prosecutors, who said it was a very serious offense.De Assis Moreira must appear before a judge in Brazil every four months for two years and will have a criminal record.Ronaldinho\u0027s situation is not the same as Roberto\u0027s. He has no obligation to appear before any Brazilian judicial authority. He must only report a change of address, said Amarilla, who accepted a recommendation by four prosecutors to avoid the need for an oral trial.Before Monday\u0027s trial the public prosecutor said that Ronaldinho displayed no personal characteristics or criminal behavior that ... would put society at risk.The brothers arrived in Paraguay on March 4 with Ronaldinho, the 2005 Ballon d\u0027Or winner, due to take part in an event in support of disadvantaged children.However, two days later, the pair were taken into police custody when investigators raided their hotel following the discovery they had fake documents.Before the judge announced his decision, the defense issued a statement insisting on the innocence of both brothers.They presented Paraguayan documents to migration authorities believing they were authentic, said the statement. The people they trusted deceived them vilely.After being held in a police station in Asuncion, where Ronaldinho celebrated his 40th birthday on March 21, the two men had been under house arrest for more than four months in a luxury hotel in the capital, on bail of $1.6 million.The investigation has since expanded into a case of possible money laundering and criminal association.Some 18 people have already been arrested in connection with the case, most of them immigration officials or police officers.The investigation found no indication that either participated in money laundering or criminal association, said the defense statement.Ronaldinho, considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, was crucial in Brazil\u0027s 2002 World Cup win.He played for European giants such as Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain during a hugely successful 10-year stint in Europe.He won the Champions League and two La Liga titles with Barcelona and Serie A with Milan.After returning home to Brazil he won the Copa Libertadores - South America\u0027s equivalent of the Champions League - with Atletico Mineiro.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rule britannia freedom not slavery","story":"The BBC is in charge of the Proms, and is proud of their wide appeal. It says on its own website: “Last Night of the Proms is one of the most popular nights for the whole of the BBC Proms.” Does it ask itself why? It may have something to do with the fact that Rule, Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory are always sung that evening, with the audience enthusiastically joining in.For years now, pressure groups have complained about these songs. In the wake of Black Lives Matter, protests have grown louder. This year’s all-encompassing excuse of Covid-19 is also being deployed. Allegedly, the large quantity of players required to make the right noise might send the virus flying round the Albert Hall.Critics of Rule, Britannia fasten on a few words. One verse rejects “haughty tyrants”. According to Chi-Chi Nwanoku, a principal double bass player, this is dreadful because the British are so describing those whose land they invade. In fact, the meaning is the exact opposite: it warns against haughty tyrants – unparliamentary European powers of the mid-18th century, such as France and Spain – who might wish to invade us.As for the famous line, “Britons never will be slaves”, this is taken by Wasfi Kani, of Grange Park Opera, to suggest that “someone else can be slaves.The words contain no evidence for that interpretation. They first appeared in Thomas Arne’s 1740 masque, Alfred, about the English King (of burnt cakes legend) who defeated the invading Vikings, thus helping forge the nation. The beings in Rule, Britannia who sing about Britons never being slaves are the “ angels” who oversaw the birth of Britain “from out the azure main”. Their message is that we are born free. So last night the BBC announced that the music stays but the wicked words will go. British people value their freedom. A good many of them like celebrating it with the traditional songs of liberty. If the BBC has difficulty with that, what does it understand about the people from whom it collects the licence fee?The BBC is, however, devoting a radio programme tonight to “code-switching”. The term comes from linguistics. It means the way in which people can move between types of language or different languages in the course of the same conversation. “Franglais” would be a jokey example.Now, however, in our hypersensitive world, it has become another thing we must blame on white supremacy. It is said that black people who work with white people must code-switch to survive. They have to adopt “white” locutions and suppress their accustomed ways of talking.There can be no doubt that such code-switching takes place. But what else would one expect? It applies to any work environment in which people come from different backgrounds. In order to understand one another clearly in the workplace, a particular way of speech will tend to prevail.Thus, until about 40 years ago, the BBC always favoured the “public-school” accent among its presenters. People with regional or working-class accents had to code-switch in order to read the news. Nowadays, it is the other way round. People with public-school backgrounds have to code-switch to “mockney” in order to get on in the BBC.When I was a boy, I attended the village school, but was brought up at home with “received pronunciation”. One day, when schoolfriends came home to tea, my parents taped our conversation. The recording showed me unconsciously code-switching between fellow-pupils and my parents.Surely such adjustments are amusing, and sometimes necessary, rather than yet another thing to get furious about.I am so old that I can remember when Joe Biden first tried to become president of the United States. In the autumn of 1987, Mr Biden got into trouble for pinching speech phrases from Neil Kinnock, then the British Labour leader. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” Mr Kinnock had asked in Wales, in May.In Iowa, in August 1987, Mr Biden said, “I started thinking as I was coming over here, why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university?” He was “the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree”. Both men argued that their forebears had suffered not from stupidity, but lack of opportunity. Mr Biden did not acknowledge the phrase as Mr Kinnock’s. He did not get the nomination.Part of the comedy was the idea of a thousand generations of Kinnocks, or Bidens. For that, one would have to go back to before the invention of the wheel. It is only about 20 generations to the invention of the university.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tanks could scrapped radical overhaul armed forces","story":"Britain\u0027s tanks could be axed under radical proposals by military chiefs to modernise the armed forces. Instead, other military assets could be prioritised including cyber and space technology. The cost of upgrading the fleet of 227 Challenger 2 tanks and the 388 Warrior armoured fighting vehicles has soared encouraging the Government to consider the controversial plans. A government source told The Times: We know that a number of bold decisions need to be taken in order to properly protect British security and rebalance defence interests to meet the new threats we face.The relevance of the Challenger and Warrior tanks to modern warfare has been questioned in recent years and the MoD has shifted some investment to cyberwarfare and other cutting-edge technology.The MoD is also expecting a cut to its budget due to the impact of coronavirus on the public finances.The Times reported that the UK is already in discussions with Nato partners about plans to give up heavy armour and overhaul Britain\u0027s military contribution to the alliance.A source told the newspaper: “We simply will not be viewed as a credible leading Nato nation if we cannot field close-combat capabilities.

These could be exceptions, but do exist and it’s not just one,” Mr Van Ranst said. “It’s not good news.”In the Hong Kong case, gene sequencing was carried out to prove that the man had been infected with two different strains of Sars-CoV-2.First human reinfected with coronavirus, study claimsThe same sequencing was applied for the Dutch patient, Ms Koopmans told The Independent, though it is not yet known if this was the case for the Belgian woman.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, the song will be part of the event, albeit without lyrics due to the lack of audience amid the coronavirus pandemic. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAmid a backlash over the BBC’s decision to do a non-singing rendition of the anthem, what exactly are the lyrics, and where did the song come from?Written in 1740, “Rule, Britannia!” originates from James Thomson’s poem, “Rule, Britannia” and was set to music by Thomas Arne.At the time, the Royal Navy did not hold dominance over the oceans – which it achieved by the 19th century – and so the lyrics only took on a more patriotic significance by the late 1800s.Here are the lyrics: Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!Britons never, never, never will be slaves.When Britain first, at heaven\u0027s command,Arose from out the azure main,This was the charter of the land,And  Angels sang this strain:The nations not so blest as theeMust, in their turn, to tyrants fall,While thou shalt flourish great and free:The dread and envy of them all.Still more majestic shalt thou rise,More dreadful from each foreign stroke,As the loud blast that tears the skiesServes but to root thy native oak.All their attempts to bend thee downWill but arouse thy generous flame,But work their woe and thy renown.To thee belongs the rural reignThy cities shall with commerce shineAll thine shall be the subject main,And every shore it circles, thine.The Muses, still with freedom found,Shall to thy happy coasts repair.Blest isle! with matchless beauty crowned,And manly hearts to guard the fair.Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!Britons never, never, never will be slaves.In a statement confirming the songs would be performed, the BBC’s condemned “unjustified personal attacks” against this year’s conductor for the Proms.Michael Jackson criticised The Beatles in unearthed notes on racismThe Killers: ‘It’s a pretty gloomy time for America’Bruce Hornsby: ‘My entire class cheered when Kennedy was assassinated’Dalia Stasevska, who was reportedly was among those eager to update the programme, has received abuse on social media following Sunday’s reports.The BBC said: “We very much regret the unjustified personal attacks on Dalia Stasevska, BBC Symphony Orchestra principal guest conductor, made on social media and elsewhere.“As ever, decisions about the Proms are made by the BBC, in consultation with all artists involved.”The Last Night of the Proms takes place on 12 September.Last Night of the Proms\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”.

The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said that evidence continues to emerge, the government in Westminster should review its guidance on the matter. Geoff Barton, the union\u0027s general secretary, said a recent decision in Scotland to require masks should also prompt a re-think.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It would be prudent in the light of the decision in Scotland over face coverings in schools, and the recent guidance by the World Health Organisation, for the government in Westminster to review its existing guidance that face coverings are not required in schools in England, and provide clear direction one way or another, he said.Face masks in schools should be an option, says union22 teachers and pupils test positive for Covid-19 at reopened schoolCoronavirus: Will children have to wear face masks at school?“We have two concerns. First, parents, pupils, and staff, will be anxious about the situation and need reassurance from the government about the public health basis for its policy over face coverings in England, rather than it being left entirely to schools to explain the government’s rationale. And, second, if there is going to be any U-turn by the government that it does this sooner rather than later because the start of the new term is imminent.”On Monday, a Number 10 spokesman said there were no plans to review the guidance on face coverings in schools, telling reporters: We are conscious of the fact that it would obstruct communication between teachers and pupils.Ministers dug in further on Tuesday morning, with business minister Alok Sharma telling Sky News: PHE do not recommend the wearing of face masks in schools ... there is no current plan to review that particular guidance.Teachers\u0027 unions have been arguing that face masks should be recommended in schools since at least July. The National Education Union this week accused ministers of being “negligent in the extreme” over the issue. Unison, Britain\u0027s largest trade union which represents a number of non-teaching staff in schools, also today reiterated its call for adults working in schools to be allowed to wear masks.In Scottish secretary schools, face coverings are to be used in corridors and shared areas.

Ever see 6 water spouts at once?” Mr Leday wrote on Facebook. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWater sprouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water,  according to the National Ocean Service.The watery vortexes have the same characteristics as a regular tornado, usually occur during storms and can be just as dangerous as regular tornadoes. Double hurricane threat as two tropical storms advance towards USMr Leday caught sight of the phenomenon as two tropical storms brewed off the coast of the US and hailstones in Louisiana.After a day as a hurricane, Storm Marco brought a surge of high water to the Louisiana coast on Monday, setting the stage for Tropical Storm Laura to enter the Gulf of Mexico and move towards the same stretch of US coast later in the week, most likely as a hurricane.People along the Gulf Coast braced for an onslaught from the twin storms, with many evacuees recalling the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when catastrophic flooding breached the levees in New Orleans and as many as 1,800 people died.“What we know is there’s going to be storm surge from Marco, we know that that water is not going to recede hardly at all before Laura hits, and so we’ve not seen this before and that’s why people need to be paying particular attention,” Governor John Bel Edwards warned at a Sunday briefing.Marco had grown into a hurricane early Sunday, and while its top winds dropped to 50 mph on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center cautioned that Marco could still cause life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds along the Gulf Coast. Marco was centred about 85 miles (135 kilometres) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River Monday morning, moving northwest at 10 mph (17 kph). Thousands evacuate as twin storms head for southern US statesForecasters said it would likely remain just off the Louisiana coast through Tuesday.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries.Despite Marco’s weakening, a storm surge warning remained in place from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A tropical storm warning included Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and metropolitan New Orleans.A storm surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast for parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way. And Jeff Goldblum knows, he used to do a bit of stand-up.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes.

We are anticipating a massive increase in applications.Mainly people are saying they dont want to send their children back to schools. Ive spoken to lot of parents who are shielding and they dont want to send their children back because it opens a whole set of risks.Many of the parents are living in multi-generational households and they are worried about the child bringing back the virus and potentially their grandparents contracting coronavirus. Thats the kind of fear they have.I think the long term effects of Covid- are going to be massive.Parents are allowed to educate their child at home and a school can only refusethey plan to send their kids into classrooms part of the time.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: “If people want to sing about the subjugation and enslavement of other nations, I don’t think that should be given a  in .”His view was shared by Chi-Chi Nwanoku, founder of the Chineke!

But former Brexit Secretary David Davis has warned it is a critical endgame and the UK will soon have to be preparing for talks to collapse.He said Brussels will try to take things to the wire, adding: “The last three weeks will matter more than the first three years.” One Eurocrat admitted “outsiders don’t realise how pessimistic we’ve become” about getting a trade deal.The UK is holding firm on a refusal to accept EU red tape or cave in on fishing rights. Mr Barnier fears talks are headed for a bitter breakdown.He believes Downing Street is laying the ground for a vicious “blame game” over who is responsible for the stalemate.In a gloomy briefing to diplomats, the grumpy Frenchman claimed that last week’s tetchy round of talks have made things worse.The UK’s negotiator David Frost had put forward a draft text last week in the hope of speeding up the discussions. But Mr Barnier dismissed it as “unrealistic” and urged EU states to stay “cold blooded”.He insisted that the UK’s “clear strategy” will be to “trade off” fishing access for freedom from EU rules at the last minute.An EU source said: “We expect the mood to switch rapidly to contingency planning in expectation the UK will throw itself into the blame game rather than the endgame.”A British official hit back, saying: “The UK has consistently pushed for detailed textual discussions on the core elements of a trade agreement.“If the EU continues to stall progress because of its unrealistic asks on fish and subsidies, we will quickly run out of time.”Well now Ive seen everything. The gullible British Remainer Press report breathlessly that Michel Barnier is telling usthat the Brexit negotiations are “running out of time.” This of course is the man who squandered a year on the minutiae of the Withdrawal Agreement whilst refusing to discuss the hugely important future trade arrangement, all the while claiming that we were “running out of time.” Rather shamefully the British government put up with this nonsense, which led in turn to my resignation – but that is a story for another day.Now Barnier is desperate to resolve his so-called redline issues before we get to the critical endgame.I have always said that the last three weeks will matter more than the first three years. But there will come a time very shortly when we will have to sht the thrust of our preparations towards No Deal.The reason for this is that the European Union always runs out the clock. When it is bullying some smaller state this works to its advantage. In the Brexit negotiation what will happen in the last few weeks is that the nation states of Europe will have to come to terms with the size of the risks that Barnier is taking.If we end up with a no deal scenario – and it is possible – the Europeans stand to lose a large and very profitable marketplace, namely the United Kingdom. They stand to lose access to the most efficient financial market in the world, the City, which provides brilliantly low cost and low risk finance to all of their industries. They think that is punishing us, but they will really punish themselveswe are smart about it. They stand to lose any access to British fisheries, rather than the sensible and civilised arrangements that would apply once they accept agreed British control of our waters.They stand to lose the funding that was agreed under the Withdrawal Agreement, which was agreed on the presumption that we would get a trade deal, a political promise that the EU is failing to keep.Without a reasonable trade deal there is nothing to stop the United Kingdom repudiating the whole agreement, and simply maintaining the parts that we as a civilised nation would of course apply – including for example the protection of the rights of European Citizens.But pay money  Why  Recognise European product classications in the UK, the so-called Geographical Indications, that protect inidual European products like ham,or cheese, orbeer or wine  Why should we not allow cheaper and better products from the rest of the world to use the names in our Supermarkets This would not be the best outcome, but we would manage perfectly well.If the EU put tarfs on our goods, we willthe favour, and make money on it. Our currency would no doubt adjust to keep us competitive.And without the limitations of EU law, we could support the industries that the EU is trying to punish.Which of course is one of the reasons that the EU is trying to tie our hands on state subsidies to industry. Britain has always been much less likely to use these than European nations, but the Europeans know that they are a potential defensive weaponthey try to punish our industries.David Frost, our Brexit negotiator, is doing a good job. He has been clear on our “red lines”. Unlike the EU “red lines”, these are not just ideas made up by the Government, they are the direct outcome of the referendum. As such they represent the peoples decision, and are not subject to concession.We are not going to allow Brussels to decide our laws – which is what Barnier means by a level playing field. So it is time that the Europeans woke up to the realities.It is clear that there are only two options now for leaving at the end of the transition period, a no deal exit or a zero-tarf deal. All sensible business owners will be preparing for both. Deferral and delay is the only thing that affects certainty and the delay on March th last year was the only time when the economy was rattled – businesses will be ready for Brexit come what may when the transition period finishes at the end of the year.Certainty is what both business and the country as a whole require, not just to get Brexit done but also to help ensure that the economy bounces back from the negative economic effects of the lockdown.We already know that there has been no “Great British Exodus” nor immediate recession despite what certain pundits and commentators predicted.As long as we leave on time and do not drag this out any further, there is no reason why this should change. Indeed,we deliver the certainty of the end of the transition period, there is every reason that business and the economy will bounce back.It is incredible after all this time to see Brussels still bent on ensuring that Britain somehow loses out, so fixated are they on deterring others from ­abandoning their club.They are still making patently unreasonable power grabs even their europhile fans struggle to defend. They still want newly-independent Britain to surrender full control of our fishing waters. To agree economic restrictions to prevent us undercutting them and keep us under their thumb.They simply must change the recordthey’re genuinely worried about the potential hardship of us trading on WTO terms — and them copping the blame. No objective person will fault Britain for sticking to its guns on principles so fundamental.Michel Barnier won’t get his way. He and those pulling his strings seem strangely unable to digest that the Theresa May regime is gone, that voters threw out the Remainer Parliament and installed committed Brexiteers instead.We do agree with Barnier that negotiations seem dead in the water and a “no deal” looks nailed on. But the blame for the lost jobs, there and here, will fall squarely at Brussels’ feet.They are wedded to impossible demands no sovereign nation could meet.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course.

C. Benson, and was then put to music by Edward Elgar at the beginning of the th century, in .It was King Edward VII himself who suggested the melody for the lyrics.The music is the trio theme from Elgars Pomp and Circumstance March No.Solo    Dear Land of Hope, thy hope is crowned,       God make thee mightier yet!    On Sovran brows, beloved, renowned,       Once more thy crown is set.   Thine equal laws, by Freedom gained,       Have ruled thee well and long   By Freedom gained, by Truth maintained,       Thine Empire shall be strong.Chorus            Land of Hope and Glory, Mother of the Free,            How shall we extol thee, who are born of thee             Wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set            God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet,            God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet.Solo    Thy fame is ancient as the days,       As Ocean large and wide:    A pride that dares, and heeds not praise,       A stern and silent pride    Not that  joy that dreams content       With what our sires have won    The blood a hero sire hath spent       Still nerves a hero son.The song has recently caused controversy, because of its direct references to the glory of the British Empire.The patriotic classic has caused a stir after the BBC decided to drop it from the Last Night Of The Proms.Land Of Hope And Glory has been called out for having links to colonialism in its lyrics - and in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, has been deemed controversial.Critics have seen the lyrics, By freedom gained, by truth maintained, thine Empire shall be strongas ironic - since it was by enslaving and conquering other lands, taking their freedom, that the Empire was strong.Prof Kehinde Andrews, from the School of Social Sciences at Birmingham City University, insisted both Rule Britannia and Land Of Hope And Glory should no longer be played due to their racist propaganda connotations.The academic said on Good Morning Britain: Ban is the wrong word, its not censorship.Its saying some songs, particularly those two, are racist propaganda which celebrates the British Empire which killed tens of millions people, many of which like myself are descendants of those victims of colonialism.Its totally inappropriate, its not about banning and censorship, its about saying what songs do we want to represent us.If, and its a big , we do want an anti-racist Britain then songs like these should not be celebrated in the proms.Land Of Hope And Glory was written in .At the time, the British had just won the Boer War, and the Empire was about to reach its peak - having sway over  per cent of the world population.The patriotic song is full of references to the glory of the British Empire, colonialism, and the idea that Britons were blessed by God who made them mightier.The lyrics in the chorus, Wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set alludes to making the British Empire bigger and bigger - a concept that critics say shouldnt be gloried in a song.The reference to the extension of the British Empires boundaries may reflect the Boer War - which Brits won at the time the song was written.Classical music critic Richard Morrison said in a column for BBC Music Magazine last month: In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, it would surely be insensitive, bordering on the incendiary, to roar out these hypocritical th-century words, with or without irony.Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder of Chineke!, an orchestra whose musicians are majority black, Asian and ethnically erse, criticised the song: It’s so irrelevant to today’s society.It’s been irrelevant for generations, and we seem to keep perpetuating it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government moved fast with financial help for the millions whose incomes were hit by Covid-. The self-employed and furlough schemes were hugely welcomed and the £ per week uplt in Universal Credit made a huge dference to some hard up families, but others missed out on gaining from it because of the benefit cap – being unable to work because of the lockdown meant that they couldn’t earn enough to escape the cap. But besides the extension of free school meal replacements over the summer there was nothing specically for families with children – nothing that recognised the extra costs of raising kids. So, as our survey shows, hard-pressed parents found that while their incomes were shrinking, costs were rising. During lockdown children still needed meals and they carried on outgrowing clothes and shoes. Most were worse off and half were much worse off than before the pandemic. Debt and stress levels escalated. Sadly, some parents blamed themselves for not having enough money to meet their children’s needs. Butthe pandemic has revealed anything it’s that our social security net has become too threadbare after years of cuts and freezes. It’s no longer fit for the job of protecting us when times are tough.

It was slow to provide protective kit, slow to protect care homes and slow to start testing. Even when they had the chance to learn from other countries, such as with the exams crisis, ministers have been caught on the hop. The shambolic efforts to reopen schools in England next month are a perfect example of mistakes not being learned from but repeated. The Government has had months to prepare for the new term, yet headteachers and parents cry out for clear guidance and support. Schools want to know what happensthere is a second spike. They want clarity on whether face coverings should be worn and how staff should interact with pupils. They also need help to pay for extra cleaning and equipment.

An important study by the Child Poverty Group and the Church of England shows Britain’s poorest families have been left without the money to pay for food and utility bills. They are backing the Mirror’s call for an immediate increase in child benefit and the scrapping of the benefit cap. The Government has a warped sense of priorities when it is subsiding the wealthy to eat out but doing nothing to help the poorest. Raising child benefit by £ a week would lt at least , children out of poverty. If Boris Johnson is genuine about his wish to “level up” he would take this step now.

Boris Johnson has said that fully reopening schools to all year groups is his top priority, amid warnings that the y closure has been damaging to children. Hundreds of thousands of youngsters have not set foot in a classroom since March following the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown, and things will look a lot dferent when they go back.Parents in England could face sanctionsthey fail to send their kids to school, Downing Street has confirmed. It is an anxious time for parents and school staff, as new measures have had to be put in place to prevent the spread of the virus. Although some year groups were able toin June, September will be the first time primary and secondary schools have been fully reopened five days a week. Here we answer some of the questions that parents have been asking, using the current government guidelines. Do you have questions or concerns about ing to school  Email us at  webnews@trinitymirror  Will I be finedI donapost send my children to school  You could be, yes. The government said it is mandatory for children to go back, unless they have very specic clinical reasons - and this will apply to a very small number. Although when schools partially reopened in March parents were told they would not face sanctions, this is not the case going into the September term. Authorities will be able to issue sanctions, including fixed penalty notices, in line with their codes of conduct. My child or a family member has been shielding, how are they affected  The governmentaposs shielding programme was paused at the start of August, with officials saying it is safe for children back to go to school. There may be exceptions on clinical grounds, but guidance says these will be rare. It is possible that local guidelines could be put in placeinfection rates rise in an area, however. The guidelines say: We now know much more about coronavirusand so in future there will be far fewer children and young people advised to shield whenever community transmission rates are high. Therefore, the majority of pupils will be able toto school.  Will children and staff have to wear masks in school  The government is sticking to its guns and saying it is will not make face coverings compulsory in English schools. A Number  spokesman said: “Our guidance does not recommend face masks in school, we acknowledge face coverings could obstruct communication between teachers and pupils.” Business secretary Alok Sharma said there are no plans to review this advice. The situation is dferent north of the border, with Scotland advising that secondary school pupils should wear masks in corridors, communal areas and school buses. Will school start and finishing times change  Potentially. Headteachers have been urged to considered staggered starting times in order to prevent dferent year groups congregating at the same time. The government guidance says: We know that travel to school patterns dfer greatly between schools. If those patterns allow, schools should consider staggered starts or adjusting start and finish times to keep groups apart as they arrive and leave school. Staggered start and finish times should not reduce the amount of overall teaching time.  What happensa child or staff member tests positive for coronavirus  If schools learn that a staff member or pupil has tested positive for Covid-, they must take swt action. Members of the local health protection team will assess who has been in close contact with the inidual - meaning they must self-isolate for  days. Close contact is defined as: direct close contacts - those who have had face to face contact with an infected inidual for anyof time, within  metre, including being coughed on, a face to face conversation, or skin-to-skin contact proximity contacts - those who have had extended close contact, within  to  metres for more than  minutes, with an infected inidualthose who have travelled in a car with an infected personCould my childaposs school be shutthere are a lot of cases  Yes. If there are two or more cases in  days, orabsence rates are high due to possible Covid-, a school may have an outbreak. In this case a risk assessment should be carried out and groups of pupils may be made to self-isolate. However closing schools is a last resort. The guidance says: If schools are implementing controls from this list, addressing the risks they have identied and therefore reducing transmission risks, whole school closure based on cases within the school will not generally be necessary, and should not be considered except on the advice of health protection teams.  What happensa child develops coronavirus symptoms while at school  The government says thata child becomes unwell while at school, they must be sent home immediately. If possible, the child should be moved to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door, ideally with an open window. If this canapost be done, staff are advised to move them to an area at least two metres from anyone . Staff must wear PPEthey need to go within two metres of the child, and bathrooms must be cleaned and disinfected before theyaposre used by anyone . How will social distancing work  Again, looking at the governmentaposs guidance, inidual schools will have to find the approach that works best for them. The guidelines say: The overarching principle to apply is reducing the number of contacts between children and staff. This can be achieved through keeping groups separateand through maintaining distance between iniduals. But this is isnapost always easy - for younger children, the emphasis will be on keeping groups apart, for older children it will be on distancing.  Is it safe  The government has emphasised that schools must introduce enhanced cleaning, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often using standard products, such as detergents and bleach. Contact between iniduals must be minimised and social distancing maintained wherever possible. Schools will need to review their health and safety risk assessments. They will also have to employ essential measures including:a requirement that people who are ill stay at home robust hand and respiratory hygiene enhanced cleaning arrangements active engagement with NHS Test and Trace formal consideration of how to reduce contacts and maximise distancing between those in school wherever possible and minimise potential for contamination so far as is reasonably practicableMy child has complex needs that requires close contact, what will happen  The government says support will be provided as normal. While adults are advised to try and keep a distance from pupils where possible, it is recognised that this is not always possible. The guidance says:will not be possible when working with many pupils who have complex needs or who need close contact care. These pupils’ educational and care support should be provided as normal. Will school assemblies still be going ahead  There is no outright rule, but schools have been advised against it. The government says: Groups should be kept apart, meaning that schools should avoid large gatherings such as assemblies or collective worship with more than one group. Is there a risk of contracting the virus in corridors  Officials acknowledge that there is a risk, but says when passing briefly in corridors or in the playground, this is low. Schools should, however, consider staggered break and lesson times to avoid large groups congregating at entrances, exits and in corridors, they say.

Mercy - who was an asylum seeker - lost her job after her limited leave to remain had reportedly expired, meaning she was no longer allowed to work.

They only told their closest family and friends and ordered takeaways from their favourite restaurants rather than going out as they got to know each other. But on October , , they couldnapost hide it any more when news of their relationship was leaked. According to a new book about the couple, Finding Freedom, the leak came someone who works for Harryaposs cousin Princess Eugenie and her dad Prince Andrew. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write: The Sunday Express was going to run with the story of their relationship - and the tabloid was rumoured to have been tipped off by an employee of none other than Eugenie and her father, Prince Andrew. Eugenie is extremely close to her cousin Harry, so itaposs likely that she was upset when she found out what happened - even though it wasnapost her fault. The two royals have been very close their whole lives, with their mums Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson taking them on holiday together when they were kids. As they grew up, they took on the London clubbing scene together, sneaking into bars and doing shots together. Eugenie also played matchmaker to Harry before he met Meghan, setting him up with her actress friend Cressida Bonas. Scobie and Durand write: Eugenie has always been more than just a cousin to Harry. They were also the closest of friends. Out of all the Queenaposs grandchildren, Harry and Eugenie have one of the most natural connections. Like Harry, Eugenie is loyal, honest, and great fun. Like Harry, Eugenie also struggled to carve out her own identity growing up. Harry had always confided in his cousin when it came to the women in his le. Not only did he trust her implicitly, but friends say that she gives great advice and has always been beyond wise for her years.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring. But due to the coronavirus pandemic it has remained closed to visitors after a decision made by the Royal Collection Trust last month because of the operational challenges of social distancing in their palaces and properties.

So when full stops are used in text, younger people often perceive it to be passive aggressive, and a sign of irritation.According to TheLeiden University’s Dr Lauren Fonteyn tweeted: If you send a text message without a full stop, it’s already obvious that you’ve concluded the message.Soyou add that additional marker for completion, they will read something into it and it tends to be a falling intonation or negative tone.A  study from Binghamton University in New York involving  undergraduates, found that texts ending with a full stop were perceived as insincere, whereas messages ending with exclamation points are considered more heartfelt.Research leader Celia Klin explained that when talking in person itaposs much easier to convey emotion by using facial expressions, changing your tone of voice and eye contact. But these mechanisms canapost be used when texting. Therefore it makes sense that young people use Emojis, slang and punctuation to put across how theyaposre feeling. Professor David Crystal, one of the worldaposs leading language experts, argues that the meaning behind the usage of full stops is changing fundamentally.

The History of Dundee FC’ and ‘They Wore The Dark Blue’ books, told Tele Sport: “The season before they went to Dens Park,  , the club had gone for more high-profile players and had spent a lot of money on wages.“There were some controversial things happening, some disciplinary issues with players and then some directors not backing up other directors when it came to dealing with it.“To save money, they went with largely local lads the next season. I think the only top player they had was Sandy Keillor who was an outstanding player for a decade.“Dundee couldn’t pay off the debt, though, and were wound up. But the Scottish League stepped in, they wanted to keep a presence north of the Tay, and asked them not to pack in but to wait a while.“Essentially Dundee Football and Athletic Club liquidated and they played the last two games of the season with the new set-up under the name Dundee Football Club.“The club were fortunate that the lease for Carolina Port was changed for commercial use and the new like-minded committee moved to Dens Park.“There were now a group of like-minded people with the same drive and determination to grow the club. And the supporters responded.”Indeed, a packed Gilfillan Hall saw a new committee formed with the influential Bailie John Robertson appointed president.Soon, though, the club were without a home as their Carolina Port ground was being taken over by dock work.Gussie Park was considered before the committee settled on leasing some agricultural land alongside Provost Road and Dens Road.It was a steeply sloping bit of land but Robertson remarked the creation of the ground had been by “putting stout hearts to a stf brae” while the stand at Carolina Port was dismantled and rebuilt on the south side of the new pitch.The new era for Dundee Football Club started on August , , with , spectators and £-s-d – around £, today # taken at the gate.President Robertson kicked off for the visiting Edinburgh side St Bernard’s ahead of a - draw.Dundonian Fred McDiarmid made history by scoring Dundee’s first goal at Dens Park.Dens Park has been the scene of many happy memories for a great many people in its  year history.The ground has hosted a European Cup semi-final between the Dark Blues and AC Milan, a Fairs Cup semi-final with Leeds the visitors, three internationals between Scotland and Wales in ,  and  as well as two League Cup Finals in  and .Those were some of the great occasions but what does it mean to fans who have been heading through the turnstiles week after week, year after year Tele reader Malcolm Stewart has fond memories of watching Dave Curlett, Shug Reid, Jimmy Gabriel, Alan Cousin, Doug Cowie and many more in his early days at Dens.He said: “My first memory of going to Dens Park was when I was eight-years-old, so that would be . I went with my grandfather who had been supporting Dundee way before then.“My grandfather would take me to the Provie Road end but I was in the Main Stand for the big European games and that’s where I go now, too.  That stand has barely changed since!“I have a lot of memories about the  team, I was at Muirton for the league win. I think about half a million people say they were but I certainly was!“That team was outstanding and there was hardly ever any space anywhere in the stands in those days.“The TC Keay and Provie Road ends were open then of course, not the stands like they are now and there was an incredible atmosphere at Dens.“My favourite player was Charlie Cooke, he was something . He was later on after the European games and was only around for a couple of years but he was my favourite.“There have been plenty of good memories for me at Dens Park. Goodness knows what it will be like next season but I hope there are more to come.”The Main Stand at Dens, unique in its angled shape, will next year look back over a century of Dundee goals, moans and celebrations.Built in  by Archibald Leitch, whose other works include Old Trafford, Anfield, Goodison, Highbury, Hampden, Ibrox and Tynecastle among many more, the ‘bend’ in the middle was designed to ensure a great viewing angle whether watching from the middle or the ends of the stands.Just  years after almost being wound up, Dundee were making their presence in Scottish football felt.Price added: “The building of the stand in  was such an ambitious move. That showed from being almost liquidated  years previously and given a reprieve from the league to building one of the best stands in the country.”Thirty-two years later and the Main Stand, along with the other three sides were filled to the brim.A record , fans piled into the stadium to see a Scottish Cup second-round tie between the Dark Blues and Rangers.The Glasgow side would win - that day and go on to lt the cup as well as the ‘A’ Division title, as it was known then.The massive crowds wouldagain in the early s as the greatest Dundee team of all time celebrated their league success in  with a European adventure.Twenty-five thousand saw a Gilzean hat-trick as Bob Shankly’s Dark Blues thumped FC Cologne -, , saw another treble from Gilzean in a - victory over Sporting Lisbon and then just under , were there to see Alan Cousin and Gordon Smith see off Belgians Anderlecht in the quarter-final.Among those , was a young Norrie Price. He recalls: “I was there for what would be one of the top half-dozen attendances in what was only my second time at Dens at the age of .“Anderlecht with just short of , people at Dens Park was one of the greatest experiences of my le.“Anderlecht were a fabulous team as well, had just beaten Real Madrid. For the first  minutes it was just non-stop Anderlecht passing. Under the floodlights they had this white and mauve strip and played fabulous football. I was thinking ‘gosh, Dundee can’t get a hold of the ball!’“The experienced players helped and in the second half turned the game.“It was a fantastic atmosphere, electric. You could see puffs of smoke coming from supporters all over the ground whether the breath in the night air or cigarettes. There were lights all around the ground.“Big crowds have a le of their own and it absolutely hooked me forever.“First of all, just going to the game. It had been talked about for weeks. The newspapers were fantastic, had been talking about the game for ages and there were real souvenirs made.“Even now I have fabulous memories of all the build-up.”Gilzean would net nine times in that European run to the last four, stopped only by AC Milan, and scored a record  goals for Dundee.“Gilzean was my favourite,” added Price.“We used to pretend to be all the dferent players, Andy Penman, Alan Cousin, Alan Gilzean. Everyone wanted to be Gilzean because he scored the goals.“He had a tremendous burst of pace and would often be on the halfway line with teams trying to play offside.“It was a great team and the interchanging of passing was great to behold. You look at that era and there were so many heroes. Today the best teams have maybe three or four the kids like to pick out but it doesn’t happen so much now.“That night against Anderlecht it was Smith that made the dference, he transferred the ball from one foot to the other and wandered past the full-back and put it across for Penman. It was a goal out of nothing.”The Ibrox disaster of  saw regulations brought in and the days of huge crowds were over. Bench seats were installed which brought the capacity down from more than , to ,.Further improvements in fan safety saw that reduced even further during the s.Then , packed out the new-look Dens Park in December  as the eyes of the entire country were focused on the home of Dundee Football Club.For the second time in two years, the Scottish League Cup would be decided at Dens. This time the Dark Blues would be playing after rivals Dundee United had defeated Aberdeen in a replay of the - final the year before.The Tangerines were back to defend their trophy in what would be an all-Dundee affair, even referee Bob Valentine was local.Former Dark Blues inside forward Jim McLean, who turned out  times for the club, was in charge of United and leading them to their own glory days.Dundee were very much the underdogs, battling for promotion to the Premier Division, with United enjoying European football for the fourth-straight season.A first-half goal from Davie Dodds was added to by Paul Sturrock’s second-half brace as the Tangerines ran out - winners and lted the cup at the home of their rivals.Come the end of the campaign, it would be more cheerful for home fans at Dens Park with promotion secured at East Stirling thanks to an Eric Sinclair goal.Dundee historian Kenny Ross remembers that time as he began his love affair with the club.He said: “One of my early memories was in the run up to promotion in  .“I didn’t get to go to the League Cup Final in  at Dens, we couldn’t get tickets. My dad queued up but the shutters went up and we ended up watching it from the top of the Law with hundreds of others, from both sides, with the car radios on. It was packed up there. It was amazing.“Later that season, I remember going to a game against Berwick Rangers in March and being in the Stand Enclosure swinging my legs on the barriers! I think it finished - which tells you why I was doing that.“Myself and my dad then moved to the Provost Road end and watched games from the Bobby Cox until I started doing some of the media stuff for the club where I’m now at the back of the Main Stand.”He added: “There were , at that cup final. The last time the gates were shut were for a Skol Cup quarter-final, again against United, in  where , watched. The queues were horrendous that night before the gates closed.“The day Hearts lost the league at Dens in  was just under , and there were , in the ground when United won the league three years earlier.“The last time it was sold out was for the Championship win in  – that was a total sell-out against Dumbarton.”The next major changes came at the tail end of the th century with promotion to the top flight in  dependant on the redevelopment of Dens Park.Up came two near-identical stands at either end of the ground in record time, just  days, to meet the SPL’s required seating capacity.The Bob Shankly and Bobby Cox stands popped up and Dens Park as we recognise it today emerged into the new century.Along with the new millennium came glitz and glamour with the Bonetti revolution.Club stalwarts like Barry Smith and Gavin Rae were joined by Argentine great Caniggia and the likes of Georgi Nemsadze, Fabian Caballero and Juan Sara to boost the average home gate to ,.Fans would also see a Champions League winner in Fabrizio Ravanelli and English Premier League star Temuri Ketsbaia turn out in dark blue at Dens Park before administration hit.Supporters once more stepped in to help save the club in  through another administration, just like they did  years before.Fast forward seven years and owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms revealed plans for a new stadium to take Dundee from Dens Park to a new home at Camperdown Park.Initial hopes were that would be ready for the start of the   campaign but funding issues and a global pandemic have delayed the first spade in the ground at ‘New Campy’, the fans’ name for the potential new ground.Whenever that might arrive to replace Dens, fans will continue to flock to their club’s home of  years.However, the next home match, a League Cup clash with Forfar on October , will be a competitive match like no other at the old ground.Depending on government guidelines at the time when the new season starts, there could be no fans there for a competitive fixture. At the very least there will be social distancing measures in place to combat spread of coronavirus.The days of , at Dens Park may be gone but that won’t stop thousands still wanting to get their fix of football from the Main Stand, South Enclosure, Bobby Cox or Bob Shankly.“It’s almost a marker for your year, when the first game at Dens is,” Price added.“We were looking forward to the better weather and the play-offs earlier this year but they didn’t happen. Reality kicked in and everyone was aware how dangerous a situation it is for everyone now.“When you see football where kicking off, you do feel left out. This situation shows just how much we take for granted.”Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history\" title\"#Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-andrew-nelson-jim-mcintyre-james-mcpake embed # secretONRAQjKlL\" data-secret\"ONRAQjKlL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We are confident that Iain will bring those qualities to the role.“I must also give great thanks to Professor David Maguire, our interim principal and vice- chancellor, who joined us in February in circumstances which would have been dficult at any time but which, because of the Covid pandemic, immediately became much more so.#David has not only led the university with a quiet, confident assurance but has done so with a warmth and humanity that has been greatly appreciated by all in our community. I am delighted that David will continue in post until the end of this year.”Professor Gillespie said: “Dundee is an incredible university at the heart of an incredible city.#Its students and staff lead the world in so much and show us what a truly great university, firmly anchored in its community, can achieve.“With the Covid pandemic, and all of its repercussions on our economy and society, we have never needed our universities to lead the creation of opportunity more than we do right now.#Dundee is hungry to meet the challenges we face and to deliver on our current and future needs.#For me, having the opportunity to lead the Dundee community, in collaboration with the city and our partners in business and beyond, to deliver on the exceptional values, spirit and determination of our students and staff is the most exciting and humbling prospect I can imagine.”Before taking his current role at Leicester in January , Professor Gillespie was Director of Science and Innovation at the Natural Environment Research Council , the UK’s leading funder for environmental science.He also spent more than a decade in UK central government, with science-based roles in the Cabinet Office, and the Departments of Environment, of Trade and Industry and of Health.Professor Gillespie was born and raised in Edinburgh and holds degrees in Microbiology , International Relations and European Politicsand Business Administration .He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We believe people will chose to go to places that have clearly made reasonable adjustments to ensure, as best as they can, the safety of their staff and customers. In turn, each and every one of us must take personal responsibility for adjusting our own behaviours in those places.“The Chamber is also in discussion with MPs and other stakeholders to seek an extension to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme as we have been the only place in the UK unable to take advantage of it and this has proved highly successful in encouraging traffic through the doors in other areas.”The decision to allow pubs, cafes and restaurants to reopen will be subject to inspections by council environmental health officials, who are ensuring premises are adhering to Scottish Government guidance on physical distancing and hygiene.As of the weekend,  businesses had been contacted and assessed by the local authority, with further checks being carried out yesterday.Stephen Gow, the general manager of the Chester Hotel on Queens Road, revealed they will reopen their doors on Thursday # ing to the outdoor-only dining seen when the country took its first tentative steps back towards normality.He said: “We’re very much looking forward to reopening again on Thursday. Although we can move to an internal operation again, we believe that our customers value being outside in our marquees and this is how we will continue to operate in the coming weeks.#We were only operating for five days a week prior to the localised lockdown, but from Thursday we will be open seven days a week from  noon to am.#Mr Gow revealed the hotel had introduced a number of new safety measures in order to keep staff and customers safe.And he called on guests to be supportive of the measures as the city attempts to get moving once more.He added: “We’ve had to make minimal changes in order to reopen, as we’d always treated the guidelines as mandatory before they were legislated.#We will now, however, be taking the details of each household in a party and not just the lead booker’s details. We’ve also had new, larger tabletops created so that we can ensure, in line with environmental health advice, that households are kept at least one metre apart while they are seated.“We’ve been very supportive of the lockdown, as the safety of everyone in the city is of paramount importance.#It is important that hospitality businesses and their customers work in partnership to abide by safety guidelines and legislation for the good of the whole city. So, for example,you see your friends at a dferent table, it’s no longer permissible to stand and chat with them and our team will ask you to sit down again or to leaveyou are unwilling to do this.#We know that families have missed almost half a year of celebrations, but the maximum party size we can host is eight and this can be from no more than three households. We will be asking for proof of residence.#Hospitality businesses across the city desperately need the support of the guests in these changes.”A spokesman for HM Treasury said all Government support packages # including Eat Out to Help Out # are kept under review.He added: “Our Eat out to Help Out scheme is one part of our wider package of UK-wide support that has helped firms across the Scottish hospitality sector.“In total, , Scottish jobs have been protected through the furlough scheme, while , Scottish businesses have benefited from more £. billion of support through government-supported loan schemes.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/08/5f44bae4de82c4.80589575-124x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"six new coronavirus cases in north east as scotlands total rises by 44","story":"The north-east has recorded six new cases of coronavirus in the past  hours.The north-east’s total number of positive cases since the crisis began has increased to ,.Across Scotland there have been  new confirmed cases and no new Covid- related deaths registered in the last  hours.A total of , people in Scotland have been tested through NHS Scotland labs and UK Government Labs to date with results showing , being confirmed negative while , were positive.As of midnight a total of  patients were being treated in hospital, with one in intensive care with confirmed Covid-.Since March , , patients have been discharged from hospital.Scotland#s death toll remains at ,.The Evening Express is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Evening Express from just £. a month."},{"url":null,"title":"keep your mojo flowing until 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMusicians are wanted to play in Argyll#s next fabulous festival of original music.The organisers of the fourth MOJO festival at Craignish Village Hall have been forced to postpone until the spring of next year due to coronavirus, but artists and bands with Argyll connections # and of any musical flavour # are in demand to showcase their talent.The event#s founder, Dan Sloan-Grfiths, said: #It#s been a tough year all round as we have all had to work out how to deal with COVID-.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges. P  pupils Ross Potter-Irwin and Henry Small should get their Bikeability badges in term time next year.Through partnership with the Ardrishaig Bothy, Cycling Scotland is offering schools free instructor support, instructor training and resources to deliver Bikeability Scotland training.Bikeability Scotland is the national cycle training programme designed to give children the skills and confidence they need to cycle safely on the roads and to encourage them to carry on cycling into adulthood.

There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

The television show that propelled Mr Trump from minor New York celebrity to coast to coast recognition famously ends with losing candidates being told ldquoyoursquore fired, and the winner ldquoyoursquore hired. Given the President is running for a second time, some iation on a theme would be permissible.The Republican convention, like the Democratsrsquo gathering, will be like nothing seen before. Such are the Covid- times. Stripped back to basics, the Democratsrsquo virtual event took some getting used to. Gone was the sales conference meets Christmas party atmosphere of old, complete with pop music and balloons. Even the firework display looked asit was trying hard to be modest.A stellar line up of speakers, led by Michelle Obama, and slick production , still made it a television event that more than  million Americans watched each night. Joe Bidenrsquos speech was well received, evenhe did not receive a big bump in the polls, and another  million was added to the partyrsquos coffers. Job done, everyone happy.Will the Republicans be saying the same come Thursday night  Whatever happens, the event is not the one the party wanted. Organisers tried to get as close to the convention norm as possible, but that plan was scrapped as the death toll from Covid- continued to soar.Instead, there will be a mix of in-person events, with an audience in Washington of no more than  people, and speeches from the key players at ious locations.On Thursday the President will accept the nomination at the White House, defying critics who say the residence should not be used for party political purposes. The First Lady, Melania Trump, will take to the podium in the White House rose garden tomorrow, hoping to follow the success of Jill Biden, who filmed a video in the school in which she once taught.Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to Mr Trump, has promised a move away from what she called the ldquodour and sour mood of the Democratic National Convention. There has already been controversy over the guest spot given to lawyers Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the couple from St Louis who were pictured outside their mansion pointing guns at Black Lives Matters protesters in June.Mr Trump is expected to speak every night, andhis recent White House press conferences are any guide, viewers should expect the unexpected. Not given to delivering tightly scripted addresses, the President could find himself wandering far off topic. Any over-running will not go down well with television networks and viewers waiting for their shows to start.What a change it will be for a candidate who is at his happiest when he is speaking to his base in some vast auditorium. Gone will be the glory days of  when packed rallies cheered his every word and a penned press could be held up for the crowdrsquos ridicule. How much atmosphere can even he generate before an audience of  people  His team need to avoid at all costs repeating the flop that was the Tulsa rally, when a paltry , people turned up and the atmosphere fell flat.Come the fireworks display over the White House lawn on Thursday certain things should be clearer. As with the Democrats, the partyrsquos general direction of travel will be apparent. The Democrats went for the centre ground, going heavy on the personal ndash Mr Bidenrsquos steadiness, decency, inclusiveness ndash and light on policy. It was the most positive campaign launch since Barack Obamarsquos  run.It would be the mother and father of all convention surprisesthe Republicans followed suit. Mr Trump has been trying out ious lines for size, accusing Mr Biden and his Veep nominee Kamala Harris of being prisoners of the left. A heavy emphasis on law and order and protecting the suburbs is expected. But how personal can he be in attacking his opponents  This is not  when he questioned the integrity of Hillary Clinton, and encouraged his supporters to do the same. Voters may accept that from a candidate, but not a President.Perhaps the best the Republicans can expect from their unconventional convention is to get through it without any major gaffes. They can then start campaigning proper where it matters, on the ground. With most voters not turning their attention to the election until a couple of weeks before polling day, the conventions had already lost much of their impact.

The polls in  showing Yes at over  per cent. The ldquosurge in SNP membership. The marches. All of them have been declared as signs that the momentum is with Yes and the same inevitably happened this week with the polls showing Yes on % and %. Forgive meI donrsquot get overly excited.But we shouldnrsquot be unduly cynical either. In private, senior figures in the SNP say the tipping point they really need is % and one of the first steps towards achieving % is saying you have momentum, whether itrsquos true or not. Itrsquos the faith factor that can attract believers which is why Nicola Sturgeon keeps doing it and was doing it again this week. The new polls, she said, showed that ldquothe momentum is very clearly with us.:Veteran SNP MSP calls for complete re-write of independence caseThe second step in the process, the other factor you need to reach %, is capitalising on the momentum you actually have, but thatrsquos a tricky one for the SNP because itrsquos not clear whatrsquos causing the recent rise in support. It could be Brexit, but then again the SNPrsquos big hope in  was that the result of the EU referendum would lead to a surge for them but it pretty much failed to materialise. Indeed, the First Ministerrsquos attempts to link Brexit with a second independence referendum led to the SNP suffering big losses at the General Election in .Alternatively, the latest encouraging polls for the SNP could be down to coronavirus and the fact that people seem pleased with the SNPrsquos handling of it. Ms Sturgeon says herself she believes this to be a factor ndash ldquoshow not tell she calls it ndash but itrsquos a hard trend to capitalise on isnrsquot it  If it was Brexit fuelling support for Yes, the SNP could keep on capitalising on itthe economy suffers. Butitrsquos coronavirus thatrsquos boosting support, the crisis will eventually fade and it may take some of the new support with it.Stage three on the road to % ndash building momentum beyond your core groups ndash is also quite hard to work out. Itrsquos clear that most of the sht from No to Yes has happened among Labour voters the firmest support for Yes is also still clustered around cities and the more deprived parts of those cities. But to get independence to the -plus zone that devolution reached  years ago, you need the momentum to get beyond those hard cores.Ms Sturgeon acknowledged this herself in  when she said that what really built the momentum for devolution in the s was the involvement of people beyond party politics. ldquoThe churches, trade unions, writers, artists, business people, she said, ldquothey all had their say and they were driving forces in building the momentum that led Labour to promise a referendum and the people of Scotland to vote for a Parliament with tax ying powers. If the SNP is to get % for independence, it needs the same kind of trend.But itrsquos stage four that could really take the Yes side over the line because itrsquos often the point where the process is almost impossible to reverse. Behaviourists call it ldquosocial herding and what it means is that when a politician or cause appears to be popular, people will gravitate towards it because itrsquos popular therersquos also a certain part of the electorate that will want to be on the winning side. Again, you saw some of that in the s with devolution it got to the point whereyou didnrsquot support a Scottish Parliament, you were a bit of a freak and itrsquos not always easy to stick to a beliefyou think everyone  thinks dferently. Itrsquos social herding that will take us over the line to  plus.Which leaves the question of where Scotland actually is in the four-stage process and I think the answer to that is not as far as some in the SNP think. Therersquos no denying the upward trend for Yes, and therersquos probably been a sht because of coronavirus, but we will have to wait to seethe SNP really is in stage two and can capitalise on whatrsquos happening.As for stage three ndash reaching out beyond the hard core ndash again therersquos not much evidence yet of support changing except in the soft middle which wersquove known for a while now is prone to shting back and forth. Itrsquos also worth remembering political scientist John Curticersquos point that support for Yes may come down again under the sustained attack there will be on independence in the event of a second referendum. In other words, momentum can go down as well as up.:SNP call for Russia to respect Ukraines independenceAnd therersquos another factor which may be more important than momentum anyway. As Irsquove already pointed out, who you are and where you live was a massive factor in how you voted on independence: well-off areas voted No, poorer areas voted Yes. But demographics change and, in the end, this could be whatrsquos really critical for the independence case.First, coronavirus and Brexit will make a lot of us poorer and nationalism does well in economies that are struggling ndash so the harder le gets for people, the more likely they are to be tempted by Yes. But secondly, support for independence is higher among under-s than it is among older people and the laws of demographics are clear on that one: the second group is going to get smaller. Political views can change as you age of course, but the demographic destiny looks undeniable.The question of momentum is much less certain. I know Nicola Sturgeon says she has it, but she said the same thing in  and  and look what happened then. But there are signs of change and as soon as therersquos an indication that the coronavirus effect is sticking or that support for independence is reaching beyond the hard core, thatrsquos when the momentum could really get going.

Despite some bold action, last week the Scottish Government published their second annual progress report revealing that one in four children are still trapped in poverty.We all know that this is unacceptable. We know that this can change because we have done it before. But to achieve real change in the circumstances we now face will require a signicant increase in the scale and impact of investment across three main areas ndash employment, social security, and housing.The Scottish Government is right to highlight that independent forecasts, published in , predicted that child poverty rates would increase by , largely in response to UK Government welfare reforms. While child poverty rates may have stabilised before the pandemic, we expect an economic storm to create greater risks. Those of us restless for no child to grow up in poverty must not lose our resolve.The roll back of UK Government furlough and self-employment support schemes will see further income shocks and stronger headwinds for families in the Autumn. We are expecting to see unemployment rise and rising debt levels as families grapple with the gap between falling incomes and additional costs, with many risking falling behind with rents and mortgages.At the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, we are deeply concerned at the degree of financial strain and uncertainty felt by many families. Currently, seven in  families with children on low incomes are having to cut back on essentials. Families who were already struggling to keep their heads above water are now feeling the full force of the economic storm caused by Covid-.It is imperative that we put in place a stronger leline for these families now or we risk making the challenge of tackling child poverty in Scotland much harder in the future.Many positive steps are already being taken ndash but together their impact does not rise to the scale of the challenge we face nor provide enough targeted support for families.Our first priority must be to avoid rising unemployment leading to a surge in poverty. Government and employers need to work in partnership to urgently create new good jobs and equip Scots with the skills they need to access them.While the UK Governmentrsquos Kickstart scheme will play a key role in guaranteeing young people work for at least twelve months, itrsquos vital that this support is extended to over-s and other groups who already faced additional barriers in the jobs market before the recession.Extra resources being committed to the Parental Employment Support Fund over the next year offer potentially crucial support to help parents find the best combination of hours, earnings, and childcare to improve their prospects. To be effective, we need to see better alignment between local economic development strategies and this investment ndash boosting the supply of, and access to, good quality, flexible jobs with opportunities to progress.Sadly, we know that we are living through one of the deepest economic downturns on record and job losses are inevitable. Therefore, strengthening our social security system so that it protects people from being pulled into poverty and debt will be essential.We welcome the Cabinet Secretary Aileen Campbellrsquos commitment to prioritise the Scottish Child Payment and begin payments to low-income families with children under six by the end of February. However, as local lockdowns and ongoing social restrictions are likely to remain in place for some time, plans must be implemented to ensure that enough support reaches those who are struggling now.Many across Scotland face uncertainty about whether they will be able to access a decent home or keep the one they currently have. It is right that the Scottish Government has indicated it will act to avoid a potential Autumn spike in evictions, by extending legal protections until the end of next March.This is a vital first step, but also needs to be complemented by genuinely affordable rent repayment plans that balance the needs of tenants and landlords. Where this cannot be achieved, the Government should be ready to step in.All that said, there is no route to achieving the child poverty targets without many more families being able to access good quality, social housing. We need the Scottish Government to go well beyond its current plan, by offering greater certainty to the sector and bringing forward a credible plan to deliver affordable homes at scale during the next Parliament.The upcoming Programme for Government offers an opportunity for ministers to set out a clear plan to get us back on course in righting the wrong of child poverty.

Scotland.The First Minister continued: ldquoOur testing system is obviously working, itrsquos working well, but as demand increases or at periods of high demand bear with us as we resolve and understand any particular issues.She said anecdotal accounts suggested many parents were taking their children to be tested after they developed coughs.She said: ldquoWersquore going into a part of the year when people could have other illnesses and viruses that present with similar symptoms to Covid.ldquoSo we expect to see demand for testing increasing as we go into the autumn and winter and there will undoubtedly be peaks in that demand period.Dr Smith said it was not uncommon to see more cases of coughs or colds as children ed to school after the summer.He said: ldquoI think itrsquos inevitable that as you bring people back together, particularly as you restart schools, you get a rebound in the volume of respiratory symptoms.As a GP for many years, this was very common whenever schools went back.He said anyone with coronavirus symptoms should immediately book a test and self-isolate. However those were asymptomatic should book a test onlyadvised to do so by the Test and Protect team.Tory MSP Donald Cameron said: ldquoItrsquos not right that some people are being sent on -mile round-trips and across the border for a Covid test.ldquoWersquove been hearing from constituents that testing sites are struggling to cope with demand, and test results that should be delivered in  hours are taking several days.ldquoYoung people and teachers have already had their lives disrupted considerably.Itrsquos vital that they can get back to work and school as safely and as soon as possible.ldquoI urge the Scottish Government to find out whatrsquos gone wrong here and work quickly to maintain public confidence in the testing system.Labour MSP Monica Lennon said: ldquoSomething has gone horribly wrong that Scots are being sent to Belfast and Cumbria for Covid- tests.ldquoOnly last week the Health Secretary said that testing is key to actively hunting down the virus - but instead people are having to hunt down a test.ldquoIt isnrsquot good enough and the Scottish Government needs to fulfil its promises on testing.Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said: ldquoThis is an extremely concerning development. We know how important it is to test quickly and contain the spread of this virus.ldquoPeople need to have trust in the system and be provided with accurate information about the nearest test centre.ldquoIt would be disastrouspeople displaying symptoms travel longer distances than they should.ldquoThe Health Secretary must get to the root of this problem urgently. We canrsquot afford for the system to fall down whenever demand increases.SNP Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny said people in his area had been offered tests in Northern Ireland.He said: ldquoMy casework over the weekend highlighted that there has been a clear upsurge in demand for testing.ldquo However itrsquos not acceptable that people in Inverclyde are being asked to travel outwith our area to get a test when there is a test centre in Inverclyde.ldquoIt beggars belief that the UK Governmentrsquos test system was asking our community to travel to Northern Ireland to receive a test.ldquoEven discounting that utterly unacceptable situation, itrsquos also not good enough to expect people to travel to sites in Lochgilphead and Edinburgh.ldquoWe must have testing in our community and it is clear that we need to have a system in place that district nurses are deployed to test young children as opposed to asking parents to travel great s to then have to administer the test themselves."},{"url":null,"title":"positive-cases-covid-19-emerge-st-margarets-high-uddingston-grammar-stepps-primary","story":"Pupils and staff in Primary B at Stepps Primary have been told to stay at home for  days after being identied as close contacts of the pupil.Health bosses also confirmed pupils have tested positive at two other schools in Lanarkshire one in St Margarets High School in Airdrie and another in Uddingston Grammar.All three pupils are self-isolating and there is no known links to the cases.:In full: Scotlands primary and secondary schools where there are cases of Covid-It comes amid several positive cases being identied at schools in the area, with clusters of cases in Lanarkshire and north east Glasgow believed to be linked.Four pupils at St Ambrose High in Coatbridge have tested positive, as well as one from St Andrews High in Coatbridge and one from Caldervale High in Airdrie.There are a further three linked cases in Lanarkshire who are not staff or pupils, which takes the total to nine.Dr Josephine Pravinkumar, NHS Lanarkshire consultant in public health medicine, said:ldquoNHS Lanarkshirersquos Test and Protect service is working closely with North and South Lanarkshire Councils and the schools to identy all close contacts of the cases who are being given public health advice and being told to self-isolate.ldquoThere is evidence that mixing socially in the community, particularly around social gatherings in houses, without maintaining physical distancing measures can transmit the virus.\"It is therefore important that people remain vigilant and follow physical distancing guidance.:Positive Covid cases found at two Dundee primary schools after cluster at additional support needs schoolldquoWe are aware that there will be concern among both children and their parents at this time.\"We would like to reassure the local community that appropriate measures are being implemented.ldquoIniduals should stay off school or work and get testedthey or their close contacts experience any Covid- symptoms, such as a cough, fever or loss of taste or smell, eventhey are mild."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-andrew-mckie-arent-post-soviet-countries-free","story":"To prove that nothing ever really dates ndashnot that the old ones are the best ndash herersquos another. ldquoWill the KGB still exist when Communism is finally realised  ldquoNo, comrade. Communism will render the state and its methods of suppression obsolete. People will learn to arrest themselves.Perhaps I was put in mind of that old Cheka-nut because, having ed from the bit of formerly Communist Yugoslavia that is now Croatia, Irsquove been required to arrest myself for a fortnight, not even being allowed out to pick up a pint of milk, and can expect the police to check up on my whereabouts at any hour of the day or night, under penalty of criminal sanctions.In the old days, arrest or police surveillance would have followed travel in the other direction. But itrsquos in the UK that these measures are in place, though Irsquom pretty certain Irsquove come back with nothing more subversive of the political weal or threatening to public health than mosquito bites and the pink tinge that passes for a tanyoursquore from the West of Scotland.For the most part, currentrestrictions on liberty donrsquot much dfer between most Western and Eastern European countries. Indeed, Croatia seems a kind of idyll, where people are behaving fairly normally, though they wear masks on the bus or in shops, and restaurants are especially diligent about wiping down the tables.But itrsquos doing much the same as Italy and Spain did, and the recent rise in the virus is similar to other Continental countries. Restrictions are still widely accepted, evengrumbling has got louder as time goes on, and the inconsistencies in the policies seem more obvious.I took my chances that quarantine might be reintroduced during my stay ndash as did those heading for Spain, or Portugal, or even France ndash and at least wersquore still allowed to question the effectiveness of the ious governmentsrsquo measures to contain coronavirus.Doing so in some other post-Communist regimes, however, seems to be hazardous to health, given the surprising number of doctors in Russia who have fallen out of windows after questioning the countryrsquos Covid strategies. Therersquos a similar intolerance of dissent in Belarus, which today marks the th anniversary of its independence. There, questions of social distancinghave been shunted to the side as hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to oppose Alexander Lukashenkorsquos regime.Thatrsquos something you may think an odd response days after an electionit was won with  per cent of the electorate endorsing it, as Mr Lukashenko, in post since , maintains. It seems suspiciously of a piece with Mr Putinrsquos remarkable political longevity, and the unfortunate tendency of his opponents to end up in jail, go down with mysterious poison-related illnesses or fall out of windows.A look at the relative positions of countries that were once Communist suggests that there is quite a ide in the degree to which they now conform to western norms of liberalism, democracy, fair elections, freedom of the press and liberty of the average citizen. Croatia doesnrsquot now feel all that dferent from other Mediterranean holiday destinations ndash and thatrsquos despite the fact that, coincidentally, today also marks the th anniversary of the start of the Siege of Vuko, reminding us that it, and its FRY neighbours, were in a bitter war for much of the s.Things are not politically perfect in the region , but like most previously Communist countries west of Minsk, the Yugosphere nations now look like other European countries. Germany is entirely integrated: Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania are mainstream European, indeed EU, countries the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have the dubious distinction of being as familiar to British partygoers on a stag night as Blackpool or Benidorm.They certainly deserve to be compared on most indices of economic and political freedom,not with the UK, France and Germany, with Greece, Italy and Portugal. Even worries about nationalism or corruption in, say, Hungary, are still more like similar concerns about Malta than Azerbaijan.Yet, with the exception of the Baltic states, always western-looking, shrugging off Communism in the early s has not automatically led to freedom for the countries that suffered under it, and the distinction is between post-Communist and post-Soviet nations.On the whole, the Communist countries of Europereacted to its fall by moving towards the democratic and economic principles of the West: capitalism, or at least social democracy that recognises property rights, the importance of free trade, and the rights and freedoms of the inidual.A few are still ldquotransitional or ldquohybrid regimes or, like Montenegro, have drted backwards, but none is like Belarus, Azerbaijan, Russia or the five ldquoStans to the south of it ndash all of which are ldquoconsolidated authoritarian regimes ie, dictatorships.This provides a pretty dramatic illustration of the lie that is so popular with those who still think Communism was a pretty good idea .It turns out that capitalism or neoliberalism or free markets or classical liberal principles do not thinly disguise oppression, but are principles that make their citizens more free and prosperous. Itrsquos when you ditch Communism, but donrsquot make any attempt to replace its flawed ideology with that of the nations that were on the right side of the Cold War that you get genuine oppression, assaults on freedom and the same dictatorial gangsters in charge, just in dferent suits, and on bigger yachts.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Despite sharing an experience through Covid-, the pandemic has impacted each of us in unique and personal ways.The boundaries between home and work, between iniduals and community, have shted. The impact of the pandemic is unprecedented in our letimes.In many cases it has caused iniduals and families untold stress. There is broad recognition of the impact the crisis has had on mental and physical health. Loneliness, health concerns and financial uncertainty are three obvious pressures that people are facing. As a whisky maker, our community at home in Scotland, and further afield, have shared that experience too.We were fortunate to have a group of colleagues that very quickly reacted to the pandemic. A few iniduals who suddenly found themselves living and working in new ways, came together to develop an initiative to keep us virtually connected, physically active and give back to the communities where we live. They created, initiated and developed the idea into a global fundraising campaign with reach far beyond Scotland.The team identied how and where to give back. Collectively they saw mental health as a key cause to support, inspired by the incredible work of local charities, including SAMHin Scotland. They recruited colleagues to join the mission and commit to virtually walking, running, rowing and cycling around the world to raise funds for mental health charities. We are doing so over eight weeks from July  until the end of August with the goal of raising pound, for Mental Health charities including SAMH.I have been so impressed by my colleaguesrsquo passion to help charities in the communities where our colleagues, business partners and consumers live. We are a Glasgow-headquartered business with over  colleagues globally who have been instrumental in driving the challenge forward.Having followed Captain Tom Moorersquos extraordinary physical commitment to walk  times around his garden at  years of age, I felt that at  I needed to put myself in my discomfort zone to contribute to our collective cause. I therefore committed to running a half marathon every week for eight weeks.What keeps me going is my colleaguesrsquo enthusiasm for the cause. I am inspired every day by stories of people who have made extraordinary efforts to contribute to this challenge. For instance, my colleague Ashish in Dubai is running km every day in  degree heat, and Laura in Scotland is actively participating despite being in a high risk category after having a kidney transplant There are countless other personal stories of people pushing themselves for the greater good.Mental health is a silent killer. Not as obvious as a physical impediment, people sadly often feel there is a stigma in asking for help. Alas, I think with the economic fallout of the pandemic, mental health issues are going to increase exponentially. I want to help to ensure that anyone needing support knows how to find it. SAMH has put together a coronavirus mental health information hub for anyone looking for support which can be found on its website.Keeping connected has never been more important. My hope is that we continue to talk about mental health long after we get through this crisis, and are always ready to listen and look out for each other in both the good times and the bad.Nick Garland is chief commercial officer, Whyte  Mackay"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : amSecondary school pupils in Orkney will have to wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and school transport from next Monday.

It proposed further extraction of stone from the quarry as well as landscaping and restoration on the site.This was the second hearing of this application by the planning committee. A decision had previously been deferred, pending a site visit by councillors.Consideration was given by committee members to the proposal made by the development and infrastructure department, as well as the concerns raised by objectors. Reasons for objection included:After a y discussion, councillors chose to reject the application. This decision was led by Kirkwall East councillor, David Dawson, who was seconded by West Mainland councillor, Owen Tierney. The reasoning given for this was that the application proposed an extension which extended beyond the quarry#s defined mineral safeguard area, which Councillor Dawson and his colleagues felt was not justied. It was also felt that this extension would result in cumulative adverse impacts to residents living in nearby properties.Though this rejection was unanimously agreed by the planning committee, Kirkwall East councillor, John Ross Scott, formally lodged his objection to the decision taken by members after it had been made.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

The latest official figures have offered some hope that the spread of Covid- here is not spiralling out of control. It comes after figures released on Sunday revealed a signicant rise in the number of Covid- cases here, with the Department of Health revealing that  people had tested positive over the previous  hours. It was the highest daily rise in cases since early May. It followed grim warnings from the Health Minister last week that Northern Ireland was in danger of losing its grip on the coronavirus. A number of fresh restrictions were put in place yesterday as a result, as health officials battle to control the number of people falling ill with Covid-.

It brings to ,, the number of confirmed cases here so far. There were no further deaths announced yesterday but it emerged that one person had been transferred to intensive care. Meanwhile, the number of Covid- positive inpatients across Northern Ireland had dropped from  to nine. It is thought the drop in newly diagnosed cases from  on Sunday to  yesterday is as a result of the discovery of a number of clusters. A health service source said peaks and troughs in the figures are not unexpected and demonstrate that Northern Ireland#s Test Trace Protect system is working efficiently. However, they warned that further spikes are likely.According to the figures released yesterday, , people were tested over the previous  hours, resulting in the  positive cases. The number of people who have tested positive over the last week stands at . Mid and East Antrim and Belfast have had the highest number of positive cases over the last week, with  and  cases confirmed respectively. There were also nine active care home outbreaks yesterday, according to the latest figures. There are concerns that, as the number of cases of Covid- increase, residents of care home residents are more likely to become seriously ill or even die from the virus. Last week, Health Minister Robin Swann was forced to defend the decision to reimpose lockdown measures, including the closure of a food manufacturing plant that had been hit by a cluster. Speaking at a press conference to announce new measures Mr Swann said his experts have warned him to expect a rise in the number of hospital admissions in coming weeks to coincide with the increase in cases. He said: The reason we have nobody in ICU at this minute in time is because the last patient we had in ICU passed away. He didn#t get up and recover and walk out, so let#s not use these stats without forgetting that there#s people and families behind it. Are we overreacting  I want to be in a place where we don#t have to go to another family and tell them they have lost a loved one to Covid-.

At the moment people cannot even apply for a test, she said. I understand some of those young people have been told it could be next year before they will be able to take a driving test.It has also revealed that learner drivers who were due to sit a driving test in Craigavon are being sent to Armagh and Lisburn instead.This situation is untenable and places local motorists at a distinct disadvantage, said Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart.A Department for Infrastructure spokesperson said: The DVA has worked hard to restore services and communicate the facts to all customers. It is vitally important that health and safety is put first while working to minimise disruption.On July  the minister announced that the DVA is planning to resume some practical car and lorry driving tests from September . The DVA holds the contact details of around , driving test candidates who are either key workers, or who had a test booked and cancelled in late March to the end of June. When driver testing resumes around  key workers will be tested first.The DVA estimates it will take six to eight weeks to clear the backlog. A further update will be provided to advise when it is opening its booking system for all new customers.

They couldn#t do enough for us, just genuinely wanted to help.In this segment, Niamh Donohoe takes the opportunity to thank everyone for their kindness, love and support during this past  weeks.#RememberMyNoah💙 pic bAiMXDyJn— My Noah 💙August , Ms Donohoe was interviewed as part of an online campaign which Noah#s mother Fiona said is all about getting the answers about her son#s disappearance and death.A framed photo of Noah and a cello which the St Malachy#s College pupil played can be seen in the background.Niamh Donohoe said the community in north Belfast made all resources possible available to the family. They opened the Hub, the community centre - that was the base for all of us, the family, it was made very clear to us that we were welcome there at all times and any time. Search and rescue were there, we all came and went freely, we were comforted in there, all the ladies from the community - food and water in abundance. That was quite special, she said. On June , a vigil was held for Noah in what Ms Donohoe described as a special experience. They had arranged a vigil and we came across unaware of what was going to take place but it was special. All the familiar faces that had helped us, and people who I now keep contact with were all there. They#re all special people and we just can#t thank them enough.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandBelfast City Hall turns blue in tribute to tragic teen Noah DonohoeBelfast City Hall was lit up blue on Sunday as an act of solidarity with the mother of Noah Donohoe and her quest for answers following his tragic death.GalleryNews PremiumConvicted robber tried to sell Noah Donohoe#s laptop for cash - unaware it belonged to tragic schoolboyThe recovering heroin addict who found Noah Donohoe#s missing bag and laptop sobbed uncontrollably when told by police that it belonged to the drowned teenager.Most ReadSea crash tragedy siblings found clinging to each other, mourners toldSix remanded in custody as lawyers claim involvement of #agent provocateur# in New IRA probe Coronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and ten new cases reported as schools reopenJealous bullies forced me out of area over my glamorous home, says Belfast womanMI#s New IRA sting cuts head off the snake ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sinn Feacutein’s Karen Mullan has voiced her ‘disappointment and concern’ at the ‘unwillingness’ of Robin Swann to provide essential funding to keep Derry’s Community Crisis Intervention Servicerunning. While the SDLP’s Mark H Durkan said like everything asked for in the North West it has become a ‘whole battle’. He described the service as a ‘huge success’ which has been a literal ‘leline’ to many. Bereaved local families, activists and organisations campaigned for a service of this kind for years. googletag.cmd.push CCIS provides a ‘safe space’ for those in crisis from pm on Thursdays until am on Sundays when many other services are not operational. It is run by Extern NI from the Holywell Building on Bishop Street. People experiencing a mental health crisis are referred to the service by the PSNI and Foyle Search  Rescue or attend of their own volition. Iniduals receive immediate support forgoing the need to attend a busy hospital Emergency Department. They are also directed to additional support servicesnecessary. An independent Ulster University report found the service to be cost-effective. Figures released by the Western Trust demonstrate the need for enhanced mental health provision in the city. googletag.cmd.push At the end of June  people were waiting more than nine weeks to access adult mental health services. There were  young people waiting more than nine weeks to access child and adolescent mental health services , as of June . Foyle Search  Rescue has also responded to many emergency incidents in recent months despite a period of lockdown. ‘UNTHINKABLE’ Karen Mullan said the minister has declined requests from her and party colleagues to meet to discuss the need to fund the CCIS and mental health services in the city. She added: “Derry City and the North West area a is being neglected by the Minister and his unwillingness to invest in mental health support services. “The Community Crisis Intervention Service is a service dealing with iniduals who are facing a crisis and need de-escalation. “This crisis can be due to a mental health episode or as a result of substance misuse. “All these issues fall firmly under the remit of the Department for Health and as such the minister. “Icallon Minister Swann to provide the funding for the Intervention service and investment in mental health provision in the City.” In June the health minister visited Derry where he announced pound, of additional funding to keep the service running for three months. Mark H Durkan said it is impossible to measure the positive impact it has had and he ‘shuddered’ to think about what could have happened without it. He continued: “We were able to convince the Minister to extend funding on an interim basis. “We have to remember that tackling the mental health crisis is an Executive priority so it’s not just one for the Department of Health. “They’ve made positive noises but that has to be backed by action and for me it is unthinkable that this service wouldn’t be funded moving forward.” The Foyle MLA said it is unacceptable for service users and hard-working staff to keep getting word of short extensions and that a permanent commitment must be made. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council acknowledged that the funding provided would allow for the temporary continuation of the service. However, councillors are of the view that the Department of Health and other government departments should consider a ‘long-term funding arrangement’. In response, a DoH spokesperson said: “The additional funding provided by the Department of Health enabled Derry Crisis Intervention Service to continue until the end of September . “Correspondence from Extern has been received today requesting additional funding to support the service until the end of March . This is currently being considered. If you feel in crisis and need support oryou have observed someone who is in distress and may come to signicant harm through self-harm and suicidal behaviour please call CCIS on:    If you need to speak to someone urgently, please call Leline on   , the Samaritans or attend your local Emergency Department.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old performed a haunting version of Sinead O’Connor’s ‘Nothing Compares  U’ that received a standing ovation. Dara saw off tough competition from Paloma Faith’s other acts, Isla and Hayley, to become her representative in the final four. ”You have this amazing talent that’s technical but feels so sensitive,” said the coach. ”That feeds into the way you sing because it’s just pure beauty.” The St Colm’s High School pupil was congratulated by his family after his performance and can now look forward to the final round of the competition. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jeananne Craig worked in the English capital and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets.  But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. “We moved to Derry a year and a half ago and are so happy to be here, particularly in the last six months, when having a bit more space and being close to family and nature has been so important.” googletag.cmd.push With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist, Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport. Many things will look dferent with a range of safety measures now on board and in stations for everyone’s protection. “We expect that both scheduled timetabled services and dedicated ‘school only’ services will be busy at peak times andwhere possible, we encourage pupils to consider walking or cycling to and from school. “We continue to enhance our safety standards withregular deep cleaning of our vehicles and facilities using long lasting anti-viral disinfectant and our mobile cleaning teams are sanitising common touch areas. googletag.cmd.push We have protective screens in stations and on bus drivers cabs and have provided hand sanitiser in all main bus and train stations. “It is now compulsory for all pupils aged  or over to wear a face covering on public transport anditis strongly recommended that all pupils regardless of age should wear a face covering on any form of home to school transportwhere it is appropriate for them to do so. Compliance is already very high at over % and together with our wider safety measures, passenger confidence is growing. “It is important pupils also practice the wider safety and travel advice including good hand hygiene and use pre-paid tickets such as mLink or travelcards where they are not eligible for a sessional school pass. For everyone’s protection there will be no change given on board the bus and train. “We would also ask parents   carers and schools for their patience at this time as every year it takes a bit of time for the school traffic to settle into a pattern and this year is even more challenging as we work through the impact of this pandemic. “Translink has been at the frontline throughout this crisis helping get people to where they need to be and now, working together with the EA, we are ready to help get schools back up and running and get young people back into education in this ‘new normal’ and help Northern Ireland recover safely and sustainably”, David concluded.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Declan Devine has insisted that his players are ready as the clock ticks down towards this evenings Europa League tie with FK Riteriai in Vilnius. The Candystripes boss and his squad left Derry yesterday and flew directly to Lithuania where they have put in place their final preparations for this evening’s game against the Knights, with victory meaning over pound, to the club. City got back to winning ways at the weekend with a deserved - win over Cork City at the Brandywell, a victory which came at the exact right time for Devine and his team who have struggled since football resumed last month. googletag.cmd.push Devine was part of the City management team which flourished on the continent in  against IFK Gothenburg, Gretna and Paris St. Germain and knows full well the joy of winning at the highest level. “Its one of the highlights of your season and something that you reflect back on,” he said. “Some of the European ties Ive been involved in, both with this club and other clubs, have been highlights and memories that live with you for a long time. When you reflect back you want to remember winning thats the ultimate one because you want to progress through a round. googletag.cmd.push “Our recent history, barring Aberystwyth, hasnt been great. Weve qualied which is a sense of achievement, but we have to try and strive to be better we have to get through a round or two and try and make sure its a regular occurrence that we are playing in these types of games.” Devine has dismissed any notion that FK Riteriai are there to be beaten on Tuesday, with the Lithuanians struggling badly in their domestic league. Riteriai have played  league games in A Lyga this season, and won just one game, losing  in the process. Yet Devine believes that their league performance is not a fair reflection of the quality within the team. “This is a tough game,” he said. “Ive watched a lot of them, they are technically very good footballers, but we are going out to try and win a game. We have to be at our very, very best, as everyone has to be in Europe. We cant afford an off night because the stakes are so high. We want to be in this competition for more than  minutes so its all about the performance on the night. “This season has been absolutely nuts. I’ve never seen anything like in in  years in football. Its not something that we really enjoy playing in front of empty stadiums, but its a game of football, its a -minute game that could potentially could go to  minutes and penalties. There are no excuses, we have got to perform on the night and Ive every confidence the boys can do that.”                                                                                    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There have been some fantastic European adventures at the club over the years and ahead of this season’s Europa League adventure, we look back on some of the biggest nights in Derry City history.  September ,  Derry City , Benfica  The city came to a standstill on Wednesday, September  as Benfica, one of the true European powerhouses, arrived at the Brandywell, with Portugues legend Eusebio in tow. Derry City held their own for an hour but the class of Benfica shone through as they opened the scoring. Benfica substitute Vata got down the wing and crossed and although Vaudequin headed clear, the ball came to Swedish international Jonas Thern, who took a touch before driving the ball across the face of goal and past Tim Dalton into the corner from  yards. googletag.cmd.push Just five minutes later Benfica doubled their lead. Paniera’s corner caused pandemonium in the City penalty area and although Aldair’s shot was blocked, the loose ball came to Ricardo, whose shot beat Dalton, only to be headed off the line by Kevin Brady. The referee’s assistant raised his flag and signalled that the ball had crossed the line and referee Guy Goethals awarded the goal. Derry City were now up against it but on  minutes the Brandywell was brought back to le. Liam Coyle’s through ball sent Felix Healy in behind the Benfica defence and his left-footed shot across goal beat Silvinho, only to bounce back off the base of the post. googletag.cmd.push Fortunately for Derry, the loose ball ran into the path of Paul Carlyle, who kept his composure to drill the ball into the vacant goal from  yards. The fans exploded into le. Derry City were back in the tie. For all their efforts though, McLaughlin’s team could not get the equaliser in the closing stages, but their showing against one of the strongest teams in Europe was not lost on their supporters, who gave them a standing ovation after the game.  August ,  Derry City , Lokomotiv Sofia  Felix Healy’s Derry City side were expected to be second best in their Cup Winners’ Cup tie against Lokomotiv Sofia, the full-timers from Bulgaria. Those fortunate to bag a ticket for the game were to witness a truly historic day at the Brandywell as Derry finally got their first European win as a League of Ireland team. . The only goal of the game came just before half time when Sofia goalkeeper Ruman Apostolev misjudged a cross from Harry McCourt and the ball flicked off the underside of the crossbar before being cleared. However, the linesman signalled that the ball had crossed the line, and much to the dismay of the visitors, the goal was awarded. McCourt’s goal proved to be enough and the final whistle brought memorable scenes at the Brandywell, with a whole generation of City fans seeing their team victorious in European competition for the first time.  August ,  Apoel Nicosia , Derry City  Just two days after facing Barcelona at the Brandywell, the Candy Stripes were in Cyprus for their UEFA Cup tie against Apoel Nicosia and it proved to be a signicant occasion as Derry City finally hit an away goal in a European tie. It had taken almost  years for the Brandywell club to achieve such a feat, with games against Cardf City, Benfica, Vitesse Arnhem, Lokomotiv Sofia and Maribor all drawing a blank. The right man in the right place proved to be none other than Gary Beckett, who scored on the stroke of half time to cancel out Wojciech Kowlczyk’s earlier effort. Nicosia went on to win the game - thanks to Stelios Okkarides’ second half strike, but the crucial away goal meant that Dermot Keely’s side were still in with a chance of progression ahead of the home tie at the Brandywell.  July ,  IFK Gothenburg , Derry City  The great result in the club’s history  Every Derry City fan will be able to say where they were and what they doing when news filtered through from Sweden that the Candy Stripes had beaten IFK Gothenburg on their own patch. For those lucky enough to be in attendance at the Ullevi Stadium, it was scarcely believable and tales of the celebrations which followed the final whistle became as legendary as Sean Hargan’s winning goal. The game was still in the balance until the th minute when Derry ventured forward and won a corner. In a moment never to be forgotten by the small number of Derry City fans in attendance, Kevin Deery floated a corner into the penalty area where Sean Hargan jumped highest to send the ball back across goal and into the net. It was an unstoppable header. With time running out, goalkeeper David Forde produced arguably his two best saves in a Derry City shirt, two world class saves in the space of a minute to keep Gothenburg at bay.  August ,  Gretna , Derry City  Another amazing result, another amazing night for Derry City as  Candystripes packed into Motherwell’s Fir Park to watch a demolition. It all went to plan for Gretna in the opening stages of the game and a nervy start from the Candy Stripes was punished when they fell behind as Ryan McGuffie scored after just eight minutes. Midway through the first half, things started to go wrong for the hosts as Derry City equalised, Darren Kelly meeting the ball with a firm header, sending it into the net to level the tie with a vital away goal. The teams remained level at half time, but Derry City were out again quickly, and in one of the most stunning halves in the club’s history, they blew Gretna away with an incredible display of attacking football. Two brilliant goals from Kevin Deery, including a blistering -yard free kick, put City in control but there was still ore to come. Derry took advantage of a stunned Gretna, Ciaran Martyn scoring two brilliant inidual goals, right in front of the City fans, who were in dreamland.  September ,  Derry City , Paris St. Germain  September  was a huge date in the history of Derry City Football Club as the mighty Paris St. Germain arrived at the Brandywell to great fanfare. The game itself produced another valiant performance from the Candy Stripes, as they showed respect, but no fear, to their glamourous opponents. Twice in the opening stages Killian Brennan came close, shooting just wide before sending a magnicent shot from  yards onto the crossbar. But as the game went on, the French side began to settle and Brennan had to be a hero at the other end as he cleared the ball off the line after Fabrice Pancrate’s header had beaten David Forde. Darren Kelly then cleared the ball off the line a second time as PSG took control and Derry were glad to survive until half time. Perhaps the game’s defining moment came just after the break when Kevin McHugh broke into the PSG penalty area and was brought down. Everyone in red and white screamed for a penalty but Slovakian referee Richard Havrilla said no. It wasn’t to be, but a - draw kept Derry in with a fighting chance ahead of the second leg in Paris.  July ,  Aberystwyth , Derry City  Derry City produced arguably their best performance of the  season, as they hit five in a Europeaan away game for the second time in  years. Leading - from the first leg, City showed no mercy. They cruised into a - lead within  minutes. Headed goals from Michael Duffy and Barry McNamee ended the tie as a contest but City were far from finished. A second half hat trick from Rory Patterson, the third of which was a cheeky penalty dinked down the middle, secured an outstanding - win on the night, and a - victory on aggregate. The score line was also the highest ever recorded for an Irish side in European football history.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose.

Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public -

That is unfair. “I have raised this with the Minister and asked her to urgently review this decision and to quickly reinstate these test.I have requested a meeting with her so that the instructors can highlight their concerns.”Sinn Féin MLA John O’Dowd called for the opening of temporary driving test facility in Craigavon while the normal center is used for Covid  testing.Mr O’Dowd said: “While I welcome the commencement of Driving Tests across the North I have to express my disappoint they will not be recommencing in Craigavon. I understand the use of the current center for Covid  testing rules out this facility however other facilities could be used to keep tests in the Craigavon area.“I have written to Minister Mallon and asked for other options to be explored and another venue identied to allow learner drivers to complete their tests.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
