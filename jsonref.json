Photograph: Frank MillerThe price of bread, milk and butter has gone up by 10-30 cent in recent weeks and while such increases seem modest, they mean a family buying three sliced pans, 10 litres of milk and one 454g packet of butter weekly will be worse off by just under €100 this year compared with 2021.Increases across our supermarkets are not, by any means, confined to these staples and up and down the aisles prices have been climbing steadily for months with consumers left to pick up the tab.If the cost of an average weekly shop has climbed by just €15 – and for many people it will climb by more than that – groceries will cost €780 more over the course of the next 12 months. But that is only the starting point.As has been well documented, the annual cost of utility bills has jumped by in excess of €500 while a litre of petrol or diesel is now at least 40 cent more than this time last year, which means that an average motorist will have to spend an extra €500 to keep their car on the road.Totted up, the increases in those three areas alone comes close to €2,000, a figure which is net so people will need to earn about €4,000 simply to cover the cost of eating, heating, lighting and driving in 2022.While retail analysts Kantar have put grocery market inflation at 1.2 per cent for the 12-week period up to December 26th, the highest level of inflation recorded since February 2021, figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) paint a more stark picture.According to official data published earlier this week, consumer prices rose by 5.5 per cent in the year to December, the largest jump in 20 years.The CSO research suggests that the price of bread has climbed by 5.3 per cent over the past 12 months while pasta has gone up by 6.4 per cent. Poultry has increased by 3.5 per cent. Coffee and tea have climbed in price by 2.5 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively while the “oils and fats” category including butter, vegetable oils and olive oil has jumped by 4.4 per cent.These increases are annual but many of the price jumps have been recorded in the last month.Future pricesThere will be more price hikes coming down the tracks. “We are still seeing the impact of Brexit, Covid and other supply chain issues and they will be washing through the system for much of this year,” said retail expert and TU Dublin academic, Damien O’Reilly.Many of the increases have been replicated to the cent across the Irish grocery landscape, thanks at least in part to the practice of price matching that is a key policy adopted by the State’s leading supermarkets.When asked about price increases, a Lidl spokeswoman said it was doing “everything possible to keep the price paid by our customers to a minimum” and said any prices increases would be as a last resort.However, she pointed to “rising inflation, increasing energy and raw materials costs and fuel cost increases of up to 30 per cent” and said “as with all retailers, these external factors have had an impact on the price of a small number of products”.Aldi Ireland’s buying director, John Curtin, said the “costs of ingredients and commodities have increased significantly”, but stressed it had been “working hard with our suppliers to mitigate supply chain cost rises and shield our customers from price increases”.Tesco said it was working “collaboratively with our suppliers to minimise impacts” but a spokeswoman confirmed that “commodity price increases, changes to input costs and the impact of global demand” could lead to price increases.SuperValu said it was “working hard” with suppliers to “ensure we continue to deliver the best value” and it warned that with food retail inflation rising “consumers may start to see price increases in certain products”.Dunnes Stores did not respond to queries from The ."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education.Languages, health and engineering among areas likely to be needed by 2026Many arts graduates now entering marketing, advertising, journalism, technology and lawInstead of taking the traditional route, Denisa Zima chose an accounting apprenticeshipSubject area profiles: Law and Business"},{"url":null,"title":"property group clashes with council over dundrum residential development","story":"The old Dundrum shopping centre: Property group Hammerson and insurer Allianz have been in talks with An Bord Pleanála to build up to 889 apartments on the site. Photograph: Tom HonanThe owners of Dundrum Town Centre have clashed with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council over demands for more large apartments as they advance fast-track plans for a major residential development in the south Dublin village. Property group Hammerson and insurer Allianz, which operate the new shopping complex in the area, have been in talks with An Bord Pleanála to build up to 889 apartments on the site of the old Dundrum shopping centre. Their company, Dundrum Retail Ltd Partnership, has told the council it should scrap new requirements for “a minimum of three-plus bedroom units” in large apartment blocks that are included among proposed amendments to its draft county development plan. In a submission last week to the council, the company said the new guidelines were in conflict with official rules that said there should be no minimum requirement for apartments with three or more bedrooms.According to the company, the justification for the guidelines was based on fast-track strategic housing development permissions in the council area and “evidence” from certain boroughs in London.“The draft development plan needs to be amended to remove the very prescriptive requirement for apartments with three or more bedrooms and to allow applicants to make the case for a particular unit mix based on the particular attributes of local areas where a different mix might be appropriate.”The company also told the council that proposed amendments to the development plan presented “contradictory or ambiguous objectives” in relation to proposals for a community, cultural and civic centre in the area.Such objections were included among 106 submissions on the draft plan in a public consultation which closed last week. Numerous other developers and the Irish Home Builders Association lobby group also opposed the measures, some saying they would delay or prevent the delivery of new homes.Asked about the submissions, the council said the response to any issues raised would be set out in a report by its chief executive to elected members which would be published. “It will be a decision of the elected members to adopt the plan and it is anticipated that this will take place in early March 2022. The plan will then come into effect six weeks later,” the council said.Cost increaseIn its submission, the Irish Home Builders Association said its members were concerned that the introduction of “further onerous standards” would increase the cost of delivering new homes and their price. “This at a time when construction costs are already under huge inflationary pressure and affordability is a major issues for most home buyers,” said James Benson, director of the association. “A key concern of the home-building sector in respect of the new plan is a lack of consistency with national planning guidelinesstandards, which may be considered to be contrary to recent Government policy which sought to bring a greater extent of standardisation to national planning standards.” Another builder, Park Developments, said in a submission the draft sought “more onerous policies, objectives and standards” that would have a direct effect on housing supply. “We are already seeing the impact of the chronic shortage in the supply of housing on the affordability of rental accommodation and homeownership.” Castlethorn Construction said the blanket imposition of three-bedroom requirements “can only serve to militate against development of apartments” in the council area. It said the cost of delivering three-bed apartments was “very significant”, adding that demand was “not evident by reference to market sentiment, estate agents’ advice” and national policy imperatives. Developer Hines, which has major interests in the Cherrywood strategic development zone, said in its submission that the logic underpinning requirements for more three-bedroom units was flawed.

Photograph: Doug MillsThe New York TimesUS president Joe Biden is considering deploying several thousand US troops, as well as warships and aircraft, to Nato allies in the Baltics and eastern Europe, an expansion of American military involvement amid mounting fears of a Russian incursion into Ukraine, according to administration officials.The move would signal a major pivot for the Biden administration, which up until recently was taking a restrained stance on Ukraine, out of fear of provoking Russia into invading. But as Russian president Vladimir Putin has ramped up his threatening actions toward Ukraine, and talks between American and Russian officials have failed to discourage him, the administration is now moving away from its do-not-provoke strategy.In a meeting on Saturday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, senior Pentagon officials presented Biden with several options that would shift American military assets much closer to Putin’s doorstep, the administration officials said. The options include sending 1,000 to 5,000 troops to eastern European countries, with the potential to increase that number 10-fold if things deteriorate.The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk publicly about internal deliberations. Biden is expected to make a decision as early as this week, they said.He is weighing the build-up as Russia has escalated its menacing posture against Ukraine, including massing more than 100,000 troops and weaponry on the border and stationing Russian forces in Belarus. On Saturday, Britain accused Moscow of developing plans to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine.“Even as we’re engaged in diplomacy, we are very much focused on building up defence, building up deterrence,” secretary of state Antony Blinken said in an interview that aired on Sunday on CBS’s Face the Nation. “Nato itself will continue to be reinforced in a significant way if Russia commits renewed acts of aggression. All of that is on the table.”So far, none of the military options being considered include deploying additional American troops to Ukraine itself, and Biden has made clear that he is loath to enter another conflict after America’s painful exit from Afghanistan last summer after 20 years.But after years of tiptoeing around the question of how much military support to provide to Ukraine, for fear of provoking Russia, Biden officials have recently warned that the United States could throw its weight behind a Ukrainian insurgency should Putin invade Ukraine.And the deployment of thousands of additional American troops to Nato’s eastern flank, which includes Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Biden administration officials said, is exactly the scenario that Putin has wanted to avoid, as he has seen the western military alliance creep closer and closer to Russia’s own border.In his news conference last week, Biden said he had cautioned Putin that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would prompt Washington to send more troops to the region. “We’re going to actually increase troop presence in Poland, in Romania, etc, if in fact he moves,” Biden said. “They are part of Nato.”During a phone call this month, defence secretary Lloyd Austin warned his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, that a Russian incursion into Ukraine would most likely result in the exact troop build-up that Biden is now considering.At the time of the phone call – January 6th – the Biden administration was still trying to be more restrained in its stance on Ukraine. But after unsuccessful talks between Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, on Friday, the administration is eying a more muscular posture, including not only diplomatic options such as sanctions, but military options such as increasing military support to Ukrainian forces and deploying American troops to the region.“This is clearly in response to the sudden stationing of Russian forces in Belarus, on the border, essentially, with Nato,” said Evelyn Farkas, the top Pentagon official for Russia and Ukraine during the Obama administration. “There is no way that Nato could not reply to such a sudden military move in this political context. The Kremlin needs to understand that they are only escalating the situation with all of these deployments and increasing the danger to all parties, including themselves.”Another former top Pentagon official for Russia policy, Jim Townsend, said the administration’s proposal did not go far enough. “It’s too little too late to deter Putin,” Townsend said in an email. “If the Russians do invade Ukraine in a few weeks, those 5,000 should be just a down payment for a much larger US and allied force presence. Western Europe should once again be an armed camp.”During the meeting at Camp David, Austin and Gen Mark Milley, chair of the joint chiefs of staff, appeared by video from the Pentagon and from Milley’s quarters, where he has been quarantining since he tested positive for coronavirus. Officials said that if Biden approved the deployment, some of the troops would come from the United States, while others would move from other parts of Europe to the more vulnerable countries on Nato’s eastern flank.American officials did not describe in detail the ground troop reinforcements under review, but current and former commanders said they should include more air defence, engineering, logistics and artillery forces.Besides the troops, Biden could also approve sending additional aircraft to the region. Representative Michael McCaul, the top GOP member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the United States also needed to conduct more training in those Nato nations.“We need joint exercises in Poland, the Baltic States, Romania, Bulgaria, to show Putin that we’re serious,” McCaul said on Face the Nation. “Right now, he doesn’t see we’re serious.”According to Poland’s defence ministry, there are currently about 4,000 US troops and 1,000 other Nato troops stationed in Poland. There are also about 4,000 Nato troops in the Baltic States.The United States has been regularly flying Air Force RC-135 Rivet Joint electronic-eavesdropping planes over Ukraine since late December. The planes allow American intelligence operatives to listen to Russian ground commanders’ communications. The air force is also flying E-8 JSTARS ground-surveillance planes to track the Russian troop buildup and the movements of the forces.The Biden administration is especially interested in any indication that Russia may deploy tactical nuclear weapons to the border, a move that Russian officials have suggested could be an option.More than 150 US military advisers are in Ukraine, trainers who have for years worked out of the training ground near Lviv, in the country’s west, far from the front lines. The current group includes special operations forces, mostly army green berets, as well as national guard trainers from Florida’s 53rd infantry brigade combat team.Military advisers from about a dozen allied countries are also in Ukraine, US officials said. Several Nato countries, including Britain, Canada, Lithuania and Poland, have regularly sent training forces to the country.In the event of a full-scale Russian invasion, the United States intends to move its military trainers out of the country quickly. But it is possible that some Americans could stay to advise Ukrainian officials in Kyiv, the capital, or provide front-line support, a US official said. – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd goodbye andr%C3%A9 leon talley my glorious difficult friend","story":"André Leon Talley in Durham, North Carolina, where he grew up, in December 2016. Photograph: Jeremy M LangeThe New York TimesAndré Leon Talley was not the easiest of friends. He could be demanding. And cutting. And moody.But he was the most glorious of friends. He was soigné, to use one of his favourite words, and he had éclat, to use another. He was a true icon, prowling the world in search of glamour and beauty, disdaining “dreckitude”.“ ‘Dreckitude’ is the lowest point in the lowest ebb,” he once explained, adding, “ ‘Dreck’ is a total, total, total hot mess.”He was a hoarder who had all the most beautiful crystal and linens – not to mention Truman Capote’s old sofa – but he never entertained. He sometimes wondered why he could ensorcell so many with his wit and style but not have a lover.“I had dinners alone and I didn’t do lines of coke,” he told me about the Studio 54 era, when he worked for Andy Warhol. “I was not sexually promiscuous at all. I was fierce and smart and I did not exude that sexual energy. I wanted people to like me because I was smart, not for my black sex vibe!”André could be so hilarious that Tom Ford collected his friend’s emails and notes in a little book because they were “truly works of art”. “When he was excited, he was excited,” said Ford, who told me that he sometimes got a four-page letter on hotel stationery slipped under his door after a fashion show. “When he loved something, he loved it. When he hated something, he hated it. He was never boring.”I got to know André after he sent me a letter, in his big, loopy handwriting, about a column I wrote when my mom, who came from a family of Irish maids, died in 2005. He told me about his late grandmother in Durham, North Carolina, Bennie Davis, a maid for the men’s dormitory at Duke University, who raised him from the time he was a baby.His grandmother sparked some Proustian connections that would cause him problems later in life. He did not want to be the size of a “manatee”, he told me, but “the smell of a biscuit in butter and molasses” was his “opioid”, evoking his grandmother’s love.“So sad I got fat and had to resort to Scarlett curtains and portieres, disguised as caftans and djellabas!” he said. “But I soldier on. Hard work, though.”Ironed boxersHis grandmother taught him that poverty is not an impediment to panache she boiled his sheets white and ironed his boxer shorts and towels. Later, after Diana Vreeland plucked the tall, skinny black kid with the master’s in French literature from Brown University to be her unpaid assistant at the politan Museum Costume Institute, André understood completely when Vreeland ironed her dollar bills and tissues. Crispness was all.Indeed, it was one of the wrinkles in our relationship. I’m not an ironer. In fact, back in the 1970s, I threw out the family ironing board my mom had given me, in some sort of misguided feminist protest.When André would see me getting ready to go out in a wrinkled cocktail dress, he would fold his arms over his chest and order me to go change, or risk looking like “a roadshow Rita Hayworth”. Although that sounded good to me.Once, when we were going to the politan Opera, André looked at the bit of my sea foam vintage gown that was peeking out from under my coat. “Tulle,” he murmured ominously. “Blanche DuBois.”Another time, he took me to a White House brunch celebrating Barack Obama’s second inauguration. “This is your date?” Obama asked André, raising an eyebrow. But André didn’t care. He was focused on my footwear.“Rag \u0026amp Bone bootees are not for going to the White House,” he instructed me when we were out of the receiving line. “They are for going to Starbucks. ”As André said about his advice, “I AM NEVER WRONG!” He advised all women to moisturise their skin as well as Melania Trump, although, increasingly appalled with the racism he saw in the Trump White House, he instructed me: “We are never to talk about her again. She is nouveau riche trash.”He loved Jackie Kennedy’s style but turned on her when he learned that she had snubbed Ann Lowe, the black designer of her wedding dress, calling Lowe simply “a coloured dressmaker”.“I don’t like Jackie O,” he said. “She is now Jackie No.”Not sweetWhen André was spending the night with me for that inaugural, he got the flu and ended up staying for five days. I cleared out of my bedroom and gave him my queen-size bed. He glowered at the closet that was too stuffed to close and barked at me to remove a hat from the wall, a broad-brim, pink-ribbon number that I’d worn to Easter Mass when I was little.“Your look is not sweet,” he bellowed. “It is equestrian S\u0026ampM!”He missed his own tiger-stencilled sheets, and he called me Bad Nurse. He kept me running with his requests for chicken noodle soup, Georgetown Cupcakes, chocolate milk and turkey chilli.“Yes, I am difficult,” he said, “but I am loyal to a fault.”As his friend Diane von Furstenberg told me, when Vreeland’s eyesight failed her late in life, André went to that famous red apartment and read to her. His loyalty was not always returned by those he had assumed were his best friends in the throwaway world of fashion.“People turn on you in an eyelash blink,” he said to me, sadly.He described his sojourn leaving his size-18 Uggs beside my bed as “sheer joy and mayhem”, and he was right. We lounged in bed and watched old French movies and analysed the allure of French movie stars from the ’60s. (His favourite was Jeanne Moreau in Eva, where she flayed her lover with a riding crop.)One Christmas, to celebrate our love of movies, he gave me a special gift he’d gotten at auction: Joan Crawford’s sable coat, with “JC” embroidered inside. I didn’t put it on a wire hanger. – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside number 10 defectors club","story":"There are two words to describe what it feels like to cross the floor of the House of Commons according to defector Shaun Woodward: “Relief – and that it’s ghastly.”A little over two decades before Bury South MP Christian Wakeford jumped ship from the Conservative Party to Labour last week, Mr Woodward made the same journey, a process he found both more painful than he could have imagined and, in hindsight, always inevitable. Woodward quit after the Tory leadership under William (now Lord) Hague opposed plans to repeal Section 28, the rule prohibiting the “promotion” of homosexuality in public arenas including schools. Wakeford, a 37-year-old former insurance broker, who was elected as Conservative MP for Derby South in 2019, made his dramatic departure declaring Boris Johnson and his party incapable of providing leadership in the wake of the furore over parties at No 10.Whatever the motivation, nearly all those in the small defectors’ club of MPs say they have no regrets about breaking the ultimate political taboo.Westminster might love the drama of an MP crossing the floor, but what is the human impact on the “traitors” who abandon their tribe – and on the morale of those left behind? Can they ever find a home among politicians and activists who once saw them as the enemy, or are they always viewed with suspicion? Wakeford himself has said the decision to abandon Johnson’s party for that of Sir Keir Starmer was the most difficult of his life. Clearly shaken by the experience, he admitted to sleepless nights and stumbled over his new leader’s name in his first public event as a Labour MP, momentarily giving the impression he was now serving “Keir Llama”. For Woodward too, the decision was a traumatic one – “seismic,” he says - with his departure accelerated, as, allegedly, with Wakeford, by the Whips’ Office attempting to blackmail him into toeing the line.  “I just thought – this is horrible this is not why I came into politics. So I reached out to friends in the Labour Party and said: ‘I don’t think I am going to stay in the Conservative Party.’”“I am very conscious of the people I hurt. But I didn’t go because I would be well received, I went because I couldn’t possibly stay.”Baroness Nicholson, who as Emma Nicholson crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats in 1995, agrees: “I suddenly flipped,” she told Radio 4’s Today programme this week. “I was getting sick and tired of John Major’s vacillation on the European issue. I could suddenly take it no longer.“The worst thing about changing political parties is that you hurt people, and you hurt people who you love dearly, admire, respected, even fought with, but you hurt them very much indeed, and to live with that hurt is really, really difficult.”Like Woodward, who was dismayed by what he saw as the abandonment by Hague of One Nation Toryism, former Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger considers that her party left her, rather than the other way round. In 2019 she co-founded The Independent Group in response to what she viewed as a failure to act against anti-Semitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership this later became a new political party, Change UK, before Berger eventually joined the Liberal Democrats.“It was horrific to leave my political home of 20 years,” she reflects, “but in my mind it didn’t in any way represent the values that led me to it in the first place, so I could no longer be a part of it.“I absolutely made the right decision and I don’t have any regrets and I would do it again.” Jumping ship used to be a far more common affair – Winston Churchill decamped from the Conservatives to the Liberal Party in 1904, not returning to the fold for two decades. But even then “ratting” was a high stakes game. When a group of Labour MPs resigned the whip to join Oswald Mosley’s fascist New Party in 1931, two quit after a day to become independents.In recent years, defecting has proven something of a kamikaze mission of the 23 MPs who crossed the floor in the last 30 years, all but four lost their seats at the next election, Berger among them. Of the four who survived, two – including Woodward – had been offered safer seats than those they had won under a different party’s banner.The only two to have triumphed again at the ballot box are Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who quit the Conservatives for the UK Independent Party in 2014 crucially, both took the decision to resign as MPs and stand again in a by-election (Reckless, however, lost at the next general election).Carswell says the decision to fight a by-election was partly tactical, to put maximum pressure on then-prime minister David Cameron to hold a referendum on the question of Britain’s membership of the European Union, but also a matter of principle. Carswell’s defection was greeted relatively positively by both the voters and his party activists in his constituency of Clacton, with many in his local association following him to Ukip. To his surprise, most of his former Conservative colleagues in Parliament also remained on friendly terms.“I think they had respect for the fact that I had submitted myself to a by-election,” he says. “Had I not done that, they would have seen it as a case of getting elected under their colours then abandoning them.”That’s not to say that Carswell didn’t find the process emotional.“Anyone who is leaving one party for another is going to find difficulties. The only way to neutralise that is to resign and call a by-election.”Woodward, however, disagrees. “If you think that every time somebody crosses the floor there should be a by-election then Parliament should change the law. It shouldn’t be a reaction to one inidual’s actions. At the moment we still put the name of the candidate on the ballot paper – not the party.”Saying that, Woodward admits he felt far more comfortable in the Labour Party once he fought a general election in his new seat of St Helens. This, he says, helped him to get away from the disapproval of his former activists in his former constituency of true blue Whitney.Of Wakeford he says: “Actually, I think if he stood for a by-election, he’d probably win.” Additional reporting by Eleanor Steafel Rosa Prince is editor of The House magazineMore from NewsPolitics latest news: Sue Gray report into Downing Street \u0026#39parties\u0026#39 will not be published in full, suggests Nadhim ZahawiStay of extradition: Julian Assange wins latest round in appeal battleThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and AlexaUK withdraws British embassy staff from Ukraine amid rising Russian tensions Ukraine tensions: Nato sends \u0026#39ships and fighter jets\u0026#39 to Eastern EuropeWatch: TV crew attacked by protesters in Belgium opposed to Covid restrictionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc licence fees days could numbered two thirds britons want","story":"Nearly two thirds of the public back the abolition of the BBC licence fee, as the vast majority claim it offers poor value for money, an exclusive poll has revealed.The survey of 2,488 people, conducted after the Government announced its plans to freeze the levy, showed overwhelming support for the Culture Secretary’s proposals to shake up BBC funding and to replace the fee with a voluntary subscription.Only 23 per cent disagreed when asked if the £159-a-year licence fee should be abolished and replaced with a voluntary subscription only paid if they watched BBC programmes, according to the survey by pollsters Find Out Now and Electoral Calculus.By contrast, 42 per cent agreed strongly that it should be scrapped and a further 21 per cent agreed “somewhat”. The remainder were undecided or did not have an opinion.An even larger proportion, 71 per cent, said that the fee was either very bad value or not enough value for money. Only 14 per cent said it was good or very good value for money, while 11 per cent thought the £159 was “about right”.Nadine Dorries confirmed last week that the licence fee will be frozen at the current rate of £159 until April 2024. The BBC had pleaded for the levy to rise in line with inflation, to allow it to compete with the likes of Netflix, under the new five-year settlement, which runs until 2027.However, the Culture Secretary has also hinted that the licence fee could be scrapped in five years. John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, has proposed replacing the fee with a government grant, with viewers paying a voluntary subscription for entertainment and sport He said that the rollout of superfast broadband would ultimately allow viewers to “switch off” the BBC and pay only for programmes they wanted to view.Chris Holbrook, the chief executive of Find Out Now, said that streaming subscriptions appeared to have “tipped the balance against the BBC licence fee”.Martin Baxter, the chief executive of Electoral Calculus, said: “The public thinks the TV Licence is too high and is bad value for money. Most people would prefer a subscription-style arrangement instead of the current licence fee.”Younger viewers were more likely to say the BBC licence fee was very bad value than older people, a difference attributed to their wider use of Netflix and Amazon. Most 18- to 24-year-olds, 52 per cent, said it was very bad value versus 40 per cent of over 65s.There was also a political ide, with 60 per cent of Leave voters thinking that the BBC was very bad value for money versus 32 per cent of Remain voters. Half of Conservative voters said it was very bad value for money, as did 41 per cent of Labour voters. This compared with just 22 per cent of Liberal Democrats supporters.More than a third of respondents, 38 per cent, thought that the licence fee should be free, and two thirds said it should be no more than £100. Fewer than one person in every five believed it should be more than £150.There was also a class ide, with those in the AB social groups more likely to say that the corporation offered worse value for money.Of those in professional AB classes, 36 per cent said it offered very bad value compared with 43 per cent for C1 lower middle class households, 58 per cent for the C2 skilled working class and 61 per cent for DE working class and unemployed.A BBC spokesman said: “We trust longstanding, independent research, which shows the licence fee remains the preferred way of funding the BBC. We will continue to deliver brilliant content and work to provide great value to audiences across the UK. “We actively look forward to the national debate on the next Charter when, of course, all options should be considered.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Sue Gray report into Downing Street \u0026#39parties\u0026#39 will not be published in full, suggests Nadhim ZahawiStay of extradition: Julian Assange wins latest round in appeal battleThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and AlexaUK withdraws British embassy staff from Ukraine amid rising Russian tensions Ukraine tensions: Nato sends \u0026#39ships and fighter jets\u0026#39 to Eastern EuropeWatch: TV crew attacked by protesters in Belgium opposed to Covid restrictionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"convalescence making comeback not time","story":"More from NewsPolitics latest news: Sue Gray report into Downing Street \u0026#39parties\u0026#39 will not be published in full, suggests Nadhim ZahawiStay of extradition: Julian Assange wins latest round in appeal battleThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and AlexaUK withdraws British embassy staff from Ukraine amid rising Russian tensions Ukraine tensions: Nato sends \u0026#39ships and fighter jets\u0026#39 to Eastern EuropeWatch: TV crew attacked by protesters in Belgium opposed to Covid restrictionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"women children first onto titanic lifeboats myth historian claims","story":"It is one of the most enduring sentiments of a seemingly lost age of chivalry: “Women and children first.”However, the most famous application of that rule, on board the sinking Titanic, was in fact a myth, according to a historian.Claes-Goran Wetterholm, an author and expert on the doomed ocean liner, said it was “not true” that women and children survived thanks to the gallantry of men.Of the last survivors escaping on the final lifeboats leaving the starboard side of the ship, he said, the majority were men.Speaking to The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine to promote a new exhibition about the shipwreck in London’s Docklands, Mr Wetterholm said it is important to look again at the tragedy to “dispel some of the myths”.The exhibition will display 200 artefacts that belonged to passengers and crew on the Titanic, as well as recreate rooms on the ship to “submerge visitors in an unforgettable journey to the past”.Asked about the public obsession with the 1912 disaster, which still captures the public imagination 110 years on thanks to the blockbuster film starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, Mr Wetterholm suggested there were still new stories worth telling.The Swedish curator of the exhibition told the magazine it is “important to look again at the tragedy and dispel some of the myths”, including the notion of “women and children first”.The order, which famously came from the captain, was interpreted differently by officers on different sides of the ship, he said.“While the story goes that those who survived were women and children, it’s not true: 323 men survived, 80 per cent of them got on lifeboats from the starboard side.“They survived because first officer William Murdoch, who evacuated that side, didn’t prevent them from getting in.“On the port side, second officer Charles Lightoller had the rule of women and children first and he took it literally.“One boat that could take 65 people rowed away with 28, leaving men behind. Over on the starboard side, it was a different story. On the last boats to leave, the majority were men.”Other common misconceptions include the nationality of passengers. According to Mr Wetterholm: “The fifth-largest passenger group were Arabs. They came from Syria and Lebanon in search of new lives, travelling by boat to join the Titanic at Cherbourg.”The claim follows research at Sweden’s Uppsala University in 2012, in which economists produced an 82-page study about the survivors of shipwrecks.It showed that captains and their crew are 18.7 per cent more likely to survive a sinking ship than their passengers, with “every man for himself” a more appropriate description than “women and children first”.The study of 18 maritime disasters from 1852 to 2011 showed that, of the 15,000 people who died, only 17.8 per cent of the women survived compared with 34.5 per cent of the men.Titanic: The Exhibition has been seen by three million people during its tour of museums, and is now at Dock X London where the 200 objects are on show in Britain for the first time. The  awarded the exhibition three stars.A separate book is also seeking to overturn the previous understanding that a wireless operator aboard the ship nearest to the sinking Titanic could have saved lives.Cyril Evans, who manned the telegraph equipment on the SS Californian 60 miles away from the Titanic, could not have saved the victims even if he had been awake to receive the distress calls, according to the authors.Mr Evans went to bed at 11.30pm on Apr 14 1912, with a US inquiry later finding that had he “remained a few minutes longer at his post”, the Californian “might have had the proud distinction of rescuing the lives of the passengers and crew”.“In short, had Evans received Titanic’s distress call, it would have already foundered and most of the people in the water would have died from cold shock and exposure before Californian arrived.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Sue Gray report into Downing Street \u0026#39parties\u0026#39 will not be published in full, suggests Nadhim ZahawiStay of extradition: Julian Assange wins latest round in appeal battleThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and AlexaUK withdraws British embassy staff from Ukraine amid rising Russian tensions Ukraine tensions: Nato sends \u0026#39ships and fighter jets\u0026#39 to Eastern EuropeWatch: TV crew attacked by protesters in Belgium opposed to Covid restrictionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic raab plays down reports","story":"Dominic Raab plays down reports mandatory NHS jabs could be delayed by  monthsAs it stands, in two weeks NHS workers will be expected to prove their vaccination status, with February  the last day they can book their jab\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _World-Wide-Rally-For-Freedom-London-Protest.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" Protesters unhappy about compulsory vaccination for NHS workers Image: Getty ImagesByRachel WearmouthSenior Political Correspondent:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab played down reports that mandatory jabs for NHS workers could be delayed by six months amid growing anger over the move. According to the , Boris Johnson is preparing to put back the April  deadline.As it stands, in two weeks NHS workers will be expected to prove their vaccination status, with February  the last day they can book their jab. On February , those without jabs will face dismissal warnings. They will then be asked to work their notice periods until March . More than , NHS staff are thought to not be jabbed, but many angry about threats to their jobs joined anti-vaxx protests over the weekend.Speaking on the BBC ’s Sunday Morning programme, Mr Raab said: “Nine out of  NHS staff have now come forward and had their vaccine. That is critically important. “I do think that we continue to call for thoseto come forward to be boosted or vaccinated before the deadline but I think ultimately we have to make sure that we don’t have people putting patients at riskthey are not vaccinated.“The deadline is there to protect the most vulnerable in our hospitals but we have got the resilience because we have got nearly , more doctors, nearly , more nurses than we did in .”Pat Cullen, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said the deadline for mandatory jabs should be delayed or the policy will “backfire”. She said: “Nothing matters more to a nurse than caring for their patients safely. “Right now, our members are telling me they can’t always do that. “We are calling on the Government to recognise this risk and delay a move which by its own calculations looks to backfire.  “To dismiss valued nursing staff during this crisis would be an act of self-sabotage.” Danny Mortimer, deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations within the health service, said: “When we consulted our members, they told us that they would have preferred longer to implement the policy. “However they are working hard to prepare for the deadline and are continuing to focus on encouraging and persuading hesitant staff to get vaccinated to protect themselves and others. “We do have to acknowledge that as the deadline approaches some frontline staff will have to leave their present rolesthey continue to decline to be vaccinated.” ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Theof his term may depend on the findings of a report into partygate by civil servant Sue GrayA bad result for the PM could spell the end of his time in Britains highest office Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO Writer:,  Jan | commentsBoris Johnson isnapost out of the woods yet as he faces the publication of a potentially explosive report by a civil servant.The Prime Minister is under huge pressure to vacate his current post after controversy over parties that occurred at No  Downing Street during the height of lockdown. He has already admitted attending one party after previously assuring the House of Commons that he was furious at such behaviour, and claimed he thought it was a work event.Several Tory MPs have called for the PM to resign, including former Brexit minister David Davis.The report by Sue Gray into several alleged parties at No  during the coronavirus lockdown - which saw people locked away in their homes and unable to visit loved ones as they died in hospital - is expected to be published this week.So what will this mean for the PM   Committee  If % of Tory MPs submit a letter of no-confidence in the Prime Minister, this will trigger a vote on his future. By the current number of Tory MPs that means  letters must be sent in. A majority of Tory MPs then have to vote onthey want him to stay on in the UKaposs highest office. If he wins that vote, he cannot be challenged for another year but will be removed as leader of the Conservativeshe loses.  A damning report by Sue Gray could see a flurry of letters sent into committee chairman Sir Graham Brady this week, triggering the vote. The police and possible resignation  It is entirely possible that, should the findings of the report go against the PM, he will be forced to resign. This would most likely occurTory MPs deem there to be no other option other than to try and remove the former London mayor from office. Meanwhile, Paymaster General Michael Ellis said: If evidence emerges of what was potentially a criminal offence, the matter would be referred to the politan Police. Several members of the general public were fined for breaking lockdown rules during the height of the pandemic. Wait until the findings of the Sue Gray report  When allegations swirled of his attendance at Downing Street parties, the PMaposs defence against any potential wrongdoing was to urge the public and angry MPs to wait until the findings of the Sue Gray report were published. Some were unsurethis was a plot to buy himself more time in the role, orthe PM was confident that the report would vindicate him. It may be one reason that, as the Conservatives face a huge slump in the polls, Tory MPs have decided not to get rid of Johnson just yet. However,the report is indeed damning for the PM, it is unlikely MPs will continue to back him. The PM was a key factor behind the large majority won in the  general election, in which the Tories took a host of traditional aposred wallapos seats away from the Labour Party.MPs in those seats may not be keen to see the PM resign, as it is possible they see Johnson as important to their chances of re-election. If the findings do not implicate the PM, it could regain him the support of MPs teetering on the edge of writing a letter of no-confidence.One red wall MP, Christian Wakeford of Bury South, has already defected to Labour. He has alleged that he was threatened with having funding for a new school in his constituency pulledhe didnapost toe the line on a government vote.What will Sue Grayaposs report say   The milestone report could potentially have a huge impact on the future of British politics. Downing Street police officers have reportedly been quizzed about the partygate allegations. According to reports, their statements have been described as aposextremely damningapos.Reported by the Daily , a source said: Met officers have spoken to Sue Gray now, as you would expect, and have been able to provide a lot of information. Some MPs have criticised that the report is being conducted by Gray, supposedly known for her hard-line stance on ethics in the government. However, Gray is essentially in the position where she is reporting on her own bosses. She also has no power to recommend any punishment by way of resignations.MP Chris Bryan said on Twitter : To be clear, Sue Gray is not aposindependentapos. She may be independently minded.

It comes as the PM is braced for the publication of senior civil servant Sue Gray’s report into rule-busting parties at Downing Street during lockdown, with scores of MPs poised to turn against him. According to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Sunak, who has remained tight-lipped about his embattled boss, spoke with MPs and hinted at a timetable for launching a challenge.The Chancellor is thought to be in competition with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for backers as leadership hopefuls aim to build support on the down-low. One MP told The Mail on Sunday: “My impression is that Liz wants to go for it now, while Rishi would prefer for all this fuss to die down and run in the summer.” Another source suggested the Chancellor made clear Red Wall MPs would have “unlimited” Treasury support. They added: “He didn’t mention the leadership, but he didn’t have to - he made clear that they would be safe in his hands.”Meanwhile, aides and ministers - including Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who insiders say cancelled a rail visit in Manchester on Friday - have been drafted in to help Mr Johnson draw up a spreadsheet of wavering MPs.Shapps cancelled the visit on Friday but the visit was due to take place on Monday. A junior minister will be sent in his place and Shappsapos office say he is due at a Covid O meeting on international travel.It followed a devastating Prime Minister’s Questions for Boris Johnson in which former Tory Christian Wakeford dramatically defected to the Labour Party,. Ms Truss, meanwhile, is publicly throwing her weight behind Boris Johnson, but is said to have privately approached MPs sceptical about the PM. She said: “He is doing an excellent job. Britain was one of the first countries to roll out the Covid vaccine. “We’ve had a very successful booster programme. We’re now able to open up our economy... one of the fastest-growing economies in the G. “I want the Prime Minister to continue as long as possible in his job. He is doing a fantastic job.

The Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary said the UK will support the Ukraine to defend themselves. But said it would be extremely unlikelyfor British troops to be sent to Ukraine to physically bolster their defence. Last night Britain accused Vladimir Putin of plotting to install a puppet leader in Ukraine.The Foreign Office took the unusual step of naming former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev as a potential Kremlin candidate who would run Ukraine.  Mr Raab told Sky Newsapos Trevor Philips on Sunday: Weaposre standing shoulder to shoulder saying there will be very serious consequencesRussia takes this move to try and invade and also install a puppet regime.Vadym Prystaiko Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said he believes Mr Putin is capable of installing a pro-Moscow leader in the country.I do believe that. Itaposs not the first time theyaposve tried to do that, he told Sky News and added Ukraine is prepared to fight back.Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry said Labour backs the Governmentaposs approach to Russian aggression. Ms Thornberry also called for the Government to utilise a “new generation of sanctions”, including investigating the “unexplained wealth” of Putin allies living in the UK. The unusual move from the Foreign Office came as Western allies stepped up warnings that Russia will pay a heavy pricethe estimated , troops massed on the border launch any kind of incursion into Ukraine.In a statement, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the Russian plotting showed the s to which the Kremlin was prepared go to undermine the government in Kyiv.“The information being released today shines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine, and is an insight into Kremlin thinking,” she said.  “Russia must de-escalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy. “As the UK and our partners have said repeatedly, any Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs.” Foreign Secreary Liz Truss has previously warned Mr Putin he must “desist and step back” from war in Ukraine or risk being dragged into a prolonged conflict like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

The terrible tales we tell today of people struggling to make ends meet are before April’s rocketing fuel bills start accelerate beyond recent rises, tightening the financial screw on people already struggling to stretch incomes to cover higher living costs. The year of the squeeze, , will force more folk to choose between eating and heating as poverty kills men and women in one of the earth’s richest countries. It doesn’t have to be this way. It’s a choice by the Conservative Government. And it’s a scandal that must be challenged, forcing the Tories into another U-turn – this time suspending VAT on energy bills, giving extra help to low earners and cancelling a hefty National Insurance tax rise.  Dignied, heroic Jack Mortimer and the others deserve our support. Out the bigots The sickening bigotry, prejudice and racism within the Conservative Party exposed by MP and sacked Minister Nusrat Ghani’s explosive claim her Muslim religion was why she was sacked from Boris Johnson’s Government is utterly repellent. Deep nauseating schisms exposed in the Tories by the unacceptable discrimination, Health and Education Secretaries Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi speaking in support of Ghani while Downing Street and loyal backbencher Michael Fabricant add insults to injury, mustn’t be ignored.  This ugly scandal cannot be dealt with by the Conservative Party or Parliament. The Equality and Human Rights Commission must launch a formal inquiry into evidence that bigotry against Muslims is unlawfully polluting the governing party. Human writes Being able to read, write and count – what are confusingly known as the three Rs- are essential to live an enjoyable, interesting and rewarding le so the number of pupils going to secondary school struggling to understand even simple words and sentences is dispiriting.

But what does this really mean, whats going and whats staying Johnson has made a major announcement this week, as he removed the Plan B restrictions Image: PAByHarry ThompsonTrends Writer:,  Jan | commentsPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced some popular policies among the Tory backbenchers last week when he revealed the governmentaposs Covid exit strategy from Plan B.The announcement, which came in the middle of strong calls from both sides of the aisle for the Prime Minister to resign amid the Partygate scandal, was met with cheers from some members of the house. Speaking on Wednesday January , Johnson said: Today’s latest ONS data show clearly that infection levels are falling in England.And while there are some places where cases are likely to continue rising, including in primary schools – our scientists believe it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally.He added: Hospital admissions which were doubling every nine days just two weeks ago – have now stabilised, with admissions in London even falling. And the numbers in intensive care not only remain low but are actually also falling. So this morning, the Cabinet concluded that because of the extraordinary booster campaign together with the way the public have responded to the Plan B measures - we canto Plan A in England and allow Plan B regulations to expire. What is Covid Plan A   Plan A largely refers to the restrictions that were in place before the spread of the Omicron iant. This means that many of the rules relating to Plan B are due to be scrapped. These are:Mandatory mask-wearing in school and public places Mandatory Covid passports for large venues Official work from home adviceDuring his speech on Wednesday, Johnson said: As weto Plan A, the House will know that some measures still remain, including those on self-isolation. In particular, it is still a legal requirement for those who have tested positive for Covid to self-isolate.On Monday we reduced the isolation period to five full days with two negative tests.At the time of writing, UK travel laws remain unchanged by the announcement of theof Plan A. People will be able to visit care homes under the new restrictions. When do plan B Covid restrictions end   During his speech to the Commons, the PM broke down the ious days that parts of Plan B would be brought to a halt. He said: From the start of Thursday next week mandatory certication will end, referring to the need for Covid passports when entering large venues.He did however add that: Organisations can, of course, choose to use the NHS Covid Pass voluntarily but we will end the compulsory use of Covid status certication in England.From now, the government is no longer asking people to work from home and people should now speak to their employers about arrangements for ing to the office. And having looked at the data carefully, the Cabinet concluded that once regulations lapse, the government will no longer mandate the wearing of face masks anywhere. The regulation lapse date he referred to is this Wednesday, January . The Prime Minister also dropped the need for school children to wear masks sooner than the rest of society, saying: From tomorrow, we will no longer require face masks in classrooms, and the Department for Education will shortly remove national guidance on their use in communal areas. In the country at large, we will continue to suggest the use of face coverings in enclosed or crowded places, particularly where you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists told ride middle road","story":"Cyclists told to ride in the middle of road in major Highway Code shake-upA major shake-up to the Highway Codes come in to force later this month, and people face a £ finethey dont follow the new rules £ - with cyclists facing the biggest alternationsMany are concerned about the changes Image: Getty ImagesByEmma MunbodhMoney EditorZoe ForseyFeatures Editor:,  Jan | commentsCyclists are being advised to ride in the middle of the road in some situations as part of a huge shake-up to the Highway Code. Riders will be advised to take the new position instead of the left-hand side of the lane when approaching junctions and on quiet roads. This rule remains in place eventhere is a cycle lane, which they are not obliged to use. The rules favour cyclists and pedestrians over drivers in a new hierarchy of road users, with the logic that they are the ones who can cause the least harm. But critics have warned the changes, which come into affect at the end of the month pending final approval, could cause accidents and tension between drivers and cyclists. Another new rule stats that drivers must leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists. The positioning of cyclists is just one of many new changes announced by the Department of Transport, with those who donapost follow the rules facing tougher £ fines and six points for motorists.Bosses at road safety charity IAM RoadSmart are concerned the changes could cause an increase of road rage. Director of policy and research Neil Greig told The Times: A lot of drivers are going to think that somebody cycling in the middle of the lane in front of them is doing it to deliberately slow them down. That leads to conflict and road rage and inappropriate overtaking. Everybody needs to know all of these changes at the same time for it to work. The Highway Code shake-up will also see a change to how drivers use roundabouts, and for the first time the law will require those who can do the greatest harm to others to have a higher level of responsibility to reduce the danger. Rule  under the new section says people on the road will need to give priority to cyclists at roundabouts - Bristol Live reports.It states: You should give priority to cyclists on the roundabout. They will be travelling more slowly than motorised traffic. Give them plenty of room and do not attempt to overtake them within their lane. Allow them to move across your path as they travel around the roundabout. Cyclists, horse riders and horse drawn vehicles may stay in the left-hand lane when they intend to continue across or around the roundabout and should signal right to show you they are not leaving the roundabout. Drivers should take extra care when entering a roundabout to ensure that they do not cut across cyclists, horse riders or horse drawn vehicles in the left-hand lane, who are continuing around the roundabout.  It is a driveraposs responsibility to remain up-to-date with changes to the Highway Code, but the AA found in a survey last month that only a third of motorists were aware of the amendment.Charity campaigners have issued a warning to the government the new rules have not been promoted widely enough. Cycling UKaposs Duncan Dollimore said: Many people wonapost have read the Highway Code for years so itaposs essential that the key changes are clearly explained, with simple, accurate and memorable messages.A DfT spokesman said: The proposed upcoming changes to the Highway Code will improve safety for cyclists, pedestrians and horse riders and were announced to national press.The department has established a working group of key organisations to ensure that messages about the changes are as widespread as possible and our well-established Think! campaign will continue to ensure all road users are aware both when these changes come into effect and beyond.

The temperature is set to dip this week and people could wake up to cars with frozen windscreens. A spokesman for the Met Office said: It will turn very briefly colder on Thursday and as conditions move south it will bring showers with it.Thankfully, a simple solution can help you clear ice from the windscreen of your car quickly. Scraping away while you need to rush to work, or speed the kids off to school, is an annoying task that can be less than ideal for the morning madness.So, how can you get rid of ice on your windscreen easily with minimal products and time spent doing so  How to clear ice and frost off windscreens easily using one ingredient  You only need one easily bought ingredients to clear your windscreen of ice - rubbing alcohol mixed with water. Thataposs right, the experts at Nationwide Vehicle Contracts revealed that mixing the solution together in a spray bottle should do the trick. Rubbing alcohol can be bought from most of the big supermarkets or pharmacies like Superdrug and Boots, and it should set you back around £. Nationwide Vehicle Contracts said: Mix one part water with two parts rubbing alcohol and fill the spray bottle with the solution. This can then be sprayed on your windscreen to melt the ice.  What’s best is that this solution will not freeze, as rubbing alcohol has a freezing point of around -C, which means the bottle can be kept in your car until next time. Alcohol brings down the freezing temperature of water, which is what makes this trick so useful. Sciencing explained: As the required freezing temperature drops when alcohol is added to ice, the temperature of the glass or where surrounding the ice is now higher than the new freezing point.Since itaposs no longer cold enough to stay frozen, the ice melts. Three other safe and easy tips for de-icing your windscreen quickly  There are plenty of ways you can make sure you donapost have the problem of having to spend time scraping away ice from your car first thing in the morning. Switch on the engine to de-ice and de-mist your windscreen Small warning: this solution isnapost great for the environment, but as your car warms up the ice should melt pretty quickly. Turn your heat up and use the setting that activates the air vent for your windscreen, then give it time to thaw. The AA advises staying with your car the whole time the engine is running and also turning on the air conditioning. This will remove moisture from the air to stop the screen misting up.If the screen does mist up, use a cloth to clear it and not your hand.De-ice your windscreen with water Use lukewarm water, but do not use boiling water. Boiling water can cause a quick temperature change that can cause your windscreen to crack.  Autoglass advised: You will find that the amount of water required will depend on the size of the windshield or rear window that needs defrosting.Apply the warmed water to the frozen area by pouring or splashing it directly onto your windscreen. Vinegar solutions can de-ice your windscreen Use a solution of white vinegar mixed with water as a form of de-icing spray. There are plenty of de-icing sprays on the market, but this mixture works as well. Plus, itaposs cheap and easy to find the key ingredient as youaposre likely to have white vinegar in your kitchen cupboard. You should mix two thirds white vinegar with one third water. Spray this on the windshield the night before as the temperature drops. This should prevent your windscreen from icing up in the first place.

The -year-old admits her home leaves all her visitors shivering and her family worried she’ll get pneumonia. But Diane says these are the s she has to go, to keep those rising energy bills down. The mum-of-six and gran to seven, has seen her energy bills soar by % in recent months from £ to £. Speaking from her frosty ground floor flat in Tulse Hill, South London, she said: “A neighbour came in yesterday and I noticed she was shivering. “I said ‘I’m really sorry. Let’s move into the living room’, where the temperature was not much dferent but the sun was shining in.” The Mirror is calling for VAT on energy bills to be scrapped as rocketing prices look set to push millions into poverty. Former NHS worker Diane gets £ to live on after her rent is paid from her state pension and is dreading the energy bill rises to come.“I live in the cold. My hands are freezing at the moment. Quite often my nose is cold like a dog’s. My kids are worried I will get pneumonia. “My daughters won’t bring the kids around because my house is so cold. They worry about me getting diseases or stuff too. “ Since the pandemic Diane only ventures out to get her prescriptions because she is asthmatic and has been shielding so does not spend any money on luxuries. “I’m very worried the bills are going up because I can’t live any more frugally than I already live,” she explained. “I already don’t turn the heating on most days and I never ever turn the heating on at night. “On the very coldest days I put it on at pm and put the kitchen timer on for half an hour. There is a cold patch around about pm. “I’ve got a bath but I don’t do that a lot to be honest. I’m very low maintenance. “I mostly eat vegetables. I’ve got a gas kettle because electric kettles take up so much energy. “I’m just worried it’s going to be horrible. I have to have faith. I’m not the only one with trouble going on, they have to come up with a solution.”  Diane says she has tried other ways to heat her flat by blocking all the air vents and putting a big thick heavy curtain up but said it just causes condensation and black mould. “But I refuse to moan about it because when I was young we didn’t have gas central heating, when it got cold you just put a jumper on or do some exercise,” she said. But then admits: “At night it is very cold in here. “At the moment it’s only one degree at night and I can feel my head and my nose are absolutely verging on damp. I have to go down the bed under the sheets to get warm. “My old neighbour, who died, had a ‘noddy’ hat which he kept on all through winter. He used to sleep in it too. “Maybe I should get a hat.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSPensionsEnergy billsState pension\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In desperation for a way out of his two-year nightmare, he twice travelled to Germany for groundbreaking treatment to remove tiny blood clots, which some scientists believe are potentially to blame for Long Covid symptoms.Ronan has called on the NHS to roll out testing and carry out trials on apheresis treatment - which removes harmful components in a patientaposs blood - as most sufferers are financially or physically unable to go to clinics abroad.However UKaposs National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says it has no plans to introduce the treatment and claims to have seen little evidence that microclots are the cause for symptoms.  Ronan warns that frustrated patients are turning to the internet to find treatment as a result. Ronan, from Belfast, told The Mirror: Itaposs really really expensive, Iaposve had  sessions and Iaposve burned through nearly £,, but for an awful lot of people that would be completely out of the question. At the moment weaposve got people flying to Germany, and others flying to South Africa for treatment. Weaposve got people trying to source medication themselves, and thataposs a disaster zone. We have . million people living in the UK with a disease thataposs potentially treatable, we should be shouting about that. A study from South Africa has suggested that many Long Covid patients develop microclots in their blood, which could be responsible for the exhaustion and breathlessness they experience. And British respiratory consultant Dr Asad Khan, himself a Long Covid sufferer since , has had the treatment overseas himself after becoming frustrated with trying to have it dealt with here.  When Ronan - who had to travel in a wheelchair - was first treated in Kempten, Germany, in September, he said his blood blocked a filter machine with what he believes were tiny clots. He immediately found one of his worse symptoms, insomnia, had improved, but ed to Germany weeks later when his condition started to regress and was given a three-month course of medication to treat clotting. Thereaposs more and more data pointing to microclots being responsible for Long Covid. Whether thataposs the full picture or part of the picture we donapost yet know, but itaposs certainly in the picture, he said. Letaposs start doing something. Itaposs very frustrating for people to see this research and not being able to get this treatment. The IT consultant, whose weight dropped to under  stone in  as he battled the condition, said enduring Long Covid has been a massive struggle. Itaposs an awful disease, itaposs so brutal, he said. I was pretty much wasting away. And we donapost know what longterm damage itaposs doing. Youaposre waiting for your le to start again, itaposs like your le is on hold. For me the first  months were hell. I had horric insomnia, fatigue, I was told I needed anti-depressant medication but that didnapost do a thing. I wasnapost sleeping, I wasnapost able to work. Everything is a hurdle, I had to use a wheelchair to get through the airport, thereaposs no way Iaposd have been able to walk through. The thing that keeps me going is that Iaposm doing something about it and being proactive, Iaposll keep doing what I can. Scientists have called for more research into whether blood clotting is responsible for patients enduring symptoms so long after Covid infection.A study led by Prof Resia Pretorius, who heads the physiological sciences department at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, found evidence that people with Covid are likely to develop tiny blood clots.Prof Pretorius has said there is a need for more research to provide further understanding of the link between blood clotting and Long Covid. Michael MacLennan, chief executive of charity Covid:aid, told The Mirror that he is aware of more people travelling abroad for microclotting treatment. Itaposs something weaposve been aware of, especially with more publicity surrounding the work of Professor Resia Pretorius and her lab, he said. Long Covid has caused untold and long-lasting misery since March April  for thousands across the UK, with well over a million suffering for persistent symptoms. In the UK we need to be exploring any and all research which displays promise to alleviate those afflicted. And he said that people suffering with the effects of Long Covid are often having their condition dismissed. Mr MacLennan said: At covid:aid weaposve consistently heard of experiences where people with very real physical experiences as a result of Long Covid have been gaslit and told itaposs aposin their headapos – unfortunately including from medical professionals. More awareness and training is desperately needed so people with Long Covid can receive the treatment they need, and not experience stigma in addition to the traumas they are already experiencing. However the UKaposs National Institute for Health and Care Excellencesaid it has no plans to introduce the treatment. A spokesman said: We are not aware of the research you mention and do not have any work in progress to update our guidance on long COVID given that the only evidence we’ve found through our ongoing surveillance is an opinion piece, which wouldn’t be sufficient for us to conduct a review of evidence in this area. We’ve also been unable to find anything signicant on microclotting as a cause of symptoms. We continue to monitor the emergence of new evidence around the treatment of long COVID and regularly update our guidance to reflect this.

She began by removing harsh chemicals and toxins from her daily routines to help give her unborn daughter the best start in le and instead focused on organic, natural and sustainable products and practices. She changed her approach to everything from skincare and haircare to food, toys and even nappies. Now a parent to two children - four-year-old Arvaya and seven-month-old Sienna - with husband Amar, Jagroop admits it took a while to get everything right. Have you got in interesting story to tell  Email webnews@mirror She told MyLondon : We tried the aposno shampoo movementapos, we use coconut oil and apple cider vinegar with essential oils as shampoo. Iaposm the only one in the family who isnapost free of shampoo, but Iaposve moved to shampoo bars instead.At the beginning of giving everyone vinegar as shampoo, that was atrocious, because my daughter used go swimming and her and my husband would go into the pool and just stink of vinegar. It took a while to get the essential oil concentration to vinegar [ratio] correct, so that they donapost just go around smelling of fish and chips. Jagroop and her family all use coconut oil instead of moisturiser, which she says has saved a fortune.  And they have experimented with things like cloth nappies for the baby and silicone kitchen sponges. The Sahi family also try to reduce the amount of toys they buy and find sturdier playthings. And they work to repair existing toys. We try not to buy plastic toys, Jagroop said, but sustainability is actually about trying to reduce your wastage:something breaks,you can fix that thing, it doesnapost matter that itaposs plastic. If you canapost, give it to someone  who could fix it, try to keep it in the loop without it going in the bin. When youaposre throwing something away itaposs going somewhere, itaposs either ended up landfill, itaposs ended up in the ocean, it ends up somewhere. So, letaposs try and keep things in the cycle without bringing in too many unnecessary new things.  Not everything has worked - like with the apple cider vinegar shampoo, it can be a lot of trial and error - and Jagroop says one of the biggest mistakes she made at the beginning was trying to do too much too quickly. In the beginning, I got overwhelmed, she said. We went vegan, we did everything [at once], and we stopped after two weeks. Sustainability is really hard actually, it can be, and I thinkyou try and do it all in one go, it can be really overwhelming. Thataposs the biggest lesson I learned. With my first child I tried to do the cloth nappies, full bang, and it didnapost work. But this time around Iaposve tried the cloth nappies again, but weaposre doing it really slowly. Weaposre changing just one a day to a cloth nappy, two a day, three a day. Weaposre not completely perfect. But the number of nappies you do save, even by making that switch a couple of times a day, makes such a big dference. But now we donapost really feel it, because you donapost feel like youaposre ever losing anything, youaposre just swapping it out for more sustainable products.  After spending many years living in London, with Amar having grown up in Harrow, the family moved to the village of Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire to bring up their kids in the countryside and get the best of both worlds. They get a big open field, and then youaposre so close to London - itaposs just a short drive in, she added. In terms of the financial impact of sustainable living, Jagroop says that things kind of balance each other out. Where a product like a big tub of cold pressed, raw coconut oil might seem expensive, the family gets its moneyaposs worth by using it as shampoo and moisturiser, among other things. The cost of her organic food shop has definitely got more expensive in recent months but she puts this down to high rates of inflation. Jagroop says living a more sustainable, mindful lestyle translates into the way she goes about her day-to-day le and raises her kids. It started to give us a dferent perspective, she said. As we started to get more and more into our sustainable journey, and started to do things our own way, we started to look at that in our parenting as well. Slowly, slowly, we started to adopt these approaches - like gentle parenting, attachment parenting, Montessori education, giving them independence. Because we had a similar approach to sustainability, likeitaposs not working for you, letaposs change something, learn as you go, it kind of made us realise that we as parents are still learning, we donapost know everything. Letaposs start being open and honest about that with our children and show them that actually, you know, even at this age, you donapost know everything. Weaposre all learning, just the same way we have with sustainability. If you make a mistake, donapost worry about it, apologise, learn from it, and then try and be better.

Kim, from Selby, North Yorks., now weighs nine stone and  pounds after previously tipping the scales at  stone.The makeup artist says she gained weight after getting a job in a Chinese takeaway as a teen and would get a free meal four times a week after work. Kim then went on to have three kids, Maddison, , Lily, , and Aiden, , in the space of four years. Kim, a makeup artist, added: I tried lots of diets and managed to lose two stone, however, I hit a wall and couldnapost lose anymore.

Kim said: The dference between the prices is crazy, it was a no brainer. I paid £ for my flights, and then in August , I boarded the plane with my husband and off I went.  I couldnapost wait to get it done because I had seen so many amazing before and after pictures. It was the first operation I had ever had but I knew it was going to be worth it. After ing home from Turkey, I lost  pounds in nine days. I couldnapost believe my eyes when I stepped on the scale, I nearly passed out. Two years after my weight loss surgery, Iaposd lost five stones and  pounds, not including the weight I had previously lost from dieting, and I felt amazing. However it was a mental battle to go from a size  to a size , and although I had lost so much weight I still didnapost feel like I could wear the clothes and swimwear Iaposd been dreaming of because I had a lot of loose skin. I knew I should have been happy because Iaposd lost lots of fat, but it still wasnapost quite right. So I started looking into plastic surgery and booked myself in for a trip back to Turkey for a mummy makeover and went under the kne again in September . The package included a tummy tuck, a breast lt with fat injections and a mons lt and cost £.k. I wasnapost nervous about the surgery, I just couldnapost wait to see the results. The hospital had taken such good care of me the first time, I wasnapost worried about it. Six weeks after her surgery, as the swelling went down, Kim started really noticing the results of her plastic surgery. She couldnapost wait to see her new stomach after hating the stretchy skin in that area so much. Kim said: When I first saw myself I couldnapost believe that it was my body I was looking at. My stomach was so tight and my belly button was perfect. I formed a shopping addiction because I couldnapost wait to try on clothes and bikinis, without having to worry about my loose skin or wearing hold-in underwear. I was getting clothes deliveries every day. I love my body now and I am filled with so much more confidence. Iaposll never have to go under the kne again. It feels amazing to be happy in my own body and be able to dress the way I have always wanted to.

The strain, named Omicron BA., has been identied more than  times in the UK since November, with cases multiplying in some parts of Europe and India. BA. was last week classied as a iant under investigation by the UK Health Security Agency . There are still huge gaps in our knowledge about the mutation, with early signs suggesting it could be even more transmissible than the dominant form of Omicron - known as BA. - but no more deadly. Worldwide data suggests that Denmark is currently the epicentre of the new iant, with more than , confirmed cases. But medics have said they do not believe there is cause for alarm, with new mutations always expected. Anders Fomsgaard, chief physician and virus researcher at the Statens Serum Institut , told Danish media: We cannot see any dference in hospitalization numbers, death rates with BA., so it is not something that worries us yet.”  He said that BA. is still a new piece in the Covid game, but continued: “Right now we should just treat it as yet another iant until new data should eventually show other results. Virologist Dr Tom Peacock, from Imperial College London, said he is confident that the new sub-iant is not a mixture of Delta and Omicron.He told the Daily Mail : Even with slightly higher transmissibility this absolutely is not a Delta to Omicron change, and instead is likely to be slower and more subtle.“That said, I would not be surprisedBA. slowly replaces [Omicron] over the coming months with a slightly more optimised mutations.apos The scientist, from Imperial College London, “Very early observations from India and Denmark suggest there is no dramatic dference in severity.” Authorities said  Omicron BA. infections have been confirmed by Whole Genome Sequencing in England, with the earliest dated December .The areas with the largest number of confirmed cases are Londonand the South East . It is not known where BA. first originated. So far  countries have uploaded more than , BA. sequences since mid-November. The first sequences were submitted from the Philippines and the highest number of samples have been uploaded from Denmark, where , cases have been found by Friday. Other countries that have uploaded more than  samples are India , Sweden , and Singapore . The UK Health Security Agencysays the emergence of new mutations is not unexpected.  Dr Meera Chand, COVID- Incident Director at UKHSA, said: “It is the nature of viruses to evolve and mutate, so it’s to be expected that we will continue to see new iants emerge as the pandemic goes on.Our continued genomic surveillance allows us to detect them and assess whether they are signicant. So far there is insufficient evidence to determine whether BA. causes more severe illness than Omicron BA., but data is limited and UKHSA continues to investigate. “Case rates remain high throughout the UK and we must remain vigilant and take up vaccinations. We should all continue to test regularly with LFDs and take a PCR testsymptoms develop”. In a statement, the UKHSA said: As is routine for any new iants under investigation, UKHSA is carrying out laboratory and epidemiological investigations to better understand the characteristics of this iant. We will continue to monitor this situation closely and recommend appropriate public health measuresneeded. More detail will be available in UKHSA’s regular Variant Technical Briefings.

The internal document was posted on Welcome Nurseriesapos app and included a near escape, a boy getting stuck in the loo and a toddler left to sit with faeces on his leg. The company which owns Smarties in Enderby, Leicestershire, uses the app to keep parents up to date and inform them of any announcements.But it inadvertently uploaded a document informing parents of list of faux pas it had made, LeicestershireLive reports.It was quickly taken down and parents were informed it had been posted in error by a member of staff at the firmaposs head office. The biggest issue to emerge from the post was the fact that, in July , a child attending the West Street pre-school was found about to walk through a gate said to have been left open by a member of staff.  The company said a receptionist spotted the child thanks to the buildingaposs CCTV cameras and was able to intervene before the child walked through the gate and into the car park. A member of staff reported the incident to the then-manager and deputy manager. But it did not report the incident to the childaposs family, to head office or Ofsted, the company told The firm said head office was only made aware of the incident in early-January this year and had contacted the childaposs parents to inform them of what had happened. It says an investigation is ongoing into that and a number of other incidents - and a new management team is running the nursery now. They also acknowledged that staff members did not whistle-blow to superiors after realising the management had not reported the incident - with staff now retrained to report such issues in the future. A second issue mentioned in the letter admits that a pre-school boy was shut in the toilet for some time, leaving them visibly shaking and crying when let out.  The letter says the incident happened when a staff member was told to close the door to the bathroom to stop children running in and out. They did not check the cubicles to seeany children were on the toilet and this resulted in the boy being left behind the door. Welcome Nurseries said the door was accidentally closed while the child was in there, but when staff realised the he had not ed to the room, they went back to the bathroom and let him out. Other issues in the accidental post include reports of a staff member wiping babiesapos bottoms with antibacterial wipes instead of wet wipes, causing the babies to have sore, bleeding bottoms. A later investigation by the nursery did not support this allegation.  A cook was reported to have been left to supervise pre-school children alone with no qualications to do so, and a child in soiled nappy was left unattended for so long that faeces was stuck to his leg and took  minutes to remove. One parent whose child attends the nursery, who wishes to be anonymous, said: The entire post is very worrying, but my child attends the nursery section so I am particularly concerned that a member of staff was using antibacterial wipes on the babiesapos bottoms. I definitely havenapost been told about it and only found out due to the letter. We have to provide our own baby wipes so there was literally no excuse for them to use anything , they are completely dferent. They have covered staff mistakes up and we wouldnapost have known about itthe letter wasnapost posted. The nursery was already unreliable generally before this and had caused some concern, but hearing about a child escaping in the summer makes me worry , as a parent, will I find outmy child has been put at risk   A spokesperson for Welcome Nurseries has confirmed the management in charge of Smarties Nursery has changed since the incidents in question, and that the company was tackling the situation as a matter or urgency. An internal investigation is currently running to determine how and why the issues came about - including why the nurseryaposs management had not reported the issues to head office after being informed by staff members. The spokesperson said: We can confirm that we received an email of concern on the th January regarding alleged incidents that took place around July last year, under previous management. We can also confirm that we had no prior knowledge of the incidents until the email was sent to us. The safety and well-being of all our children are our number one priority and we immediately carried out a full investigation. It was alleged that a child managed to escape from the nursery into the car park. Whilst this allegation was unfounded, on investigation it was found that a gate was left open which was seen on CCTV by the receptionist, who acted immediately before the child went out of the gate. We also investigated further incidents which occurred around the same time in which a child was left in the bathroom on their own. Our investigation found that a child had entered the bathroom area and a member of staff not knowing he was there closed the door. Both incidents were reported to the previous management team who are no longer with the company, however these were not reported onward or investigated at the time. These incidents fall well below our standard of care and we have since retrained our staff. We are continuing to work with our parents and can assure all parents that we take all concerns seriously and act on them. We profusely apologise to all our children and parents that these incidents occurred and that we were not made aware of them sooner. We have not yet finished our investigations in this matter. We have a new management structure in place at the setting. We would also like to thank our parents for their continued support. A Leicestershire County Council spokesperson said: “We have very recently been made aware of concerns raised by a parent and will be working with the setting to ensure the appropriate procedures and policies are in place.

They attend royal engagements and travel the world on tours, meeting thousands of people every year. But sometimes, when a royal is starting to fall out of favour, they may do other bits and bobs in a bid to win fans over - with dfering levels of success. In June , Prince Edward, who organised the event, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Fergie went head-to-head in a special episode of Itaposs a Royal Knockout. Each royal had a team, which was representing a dferent charity, made up of celebrities, including the late Meat Loaf, who competed in a number of dferent events.However, it didnapost go quite as they hoped and has since been described as a disaster from start to finish and one of the biggest c***-ups in the royal familyaposs history. Royal expert Ben Pimlott claims the Queen didnapost like the idea at all and all of her staff believed it would be a mistake. An insider told him: [The Queen] was against it, but one of her faults is that she canapost say no. Recalling the show on Channel aposs Fergie Vs Diana:Royal Wives at War, royal expert Jennie Bond said: Itaposs a Royal Knockout will go down in royal history as one of the biggest c**k-ups of all time I think. It was a disaster from beginning to end, it was absolutely humiliating. Sarah with her usual gusto entered into it, andshe gets into something she does it with bells on. However not all of the royal family took up the offer of taking part.  Speaking on the documentary, the Daily Mailaposs Richard Kay said: Diana famously didnapost take part, neither did Charles. He thought it was something that was beneath them. In a way, itaposs kind of unfair, Fergie took a lot of the blame, almost the scapegoat. Her behaviour was being commented on and I think, then, is when Diana came into her own. The show, which was filmed at Alton Towers, was hosted by Stuart Hall, Les Dawson and Su Pollard. Paul Daniels acted as the chief referee. Princess Anneaposs red team, raising cash for Save the Children, included Tom Jones, Clf Richard, actress Jenny Agutter, and athlete Deborah Flintoff. Fergie was joined by Michael Brandon, Ben Cross and Jane Seymour, while Prince Andrewaposs World Wildle Team included Gary Lineker, Margot Kidder, Rhys Jones and John Travolta. Meat Loaf, who passed away this week, also took part. Prince Edward was in charge of the yellow team, raising cash for the Duke of Edinburgh Scheme. Among the celebs on his team were John Cleese, Eddie Grant, Peter Blake and Christopher Reeve. More than million people turned into watch it, making it the fourth most watched show of the year. However, it wasnapost all bad news as they at least managed to raise £.m for their chosen charities.

But thereaposs one colour, youaposll rarely see the Queen wearing - and she once joked about the reason why. It appears that Her Majesty shuns wearing beige as it does nothing to help her stand out in a crowd - especially given her small stature. In his biography of the Queen, Robert Hardman says: My favourite remark she ever said was, aposI can ever wear beige because nobody will know who I am.’  And given the monarch has previously said she needs to be seen to be believed - it doesnapost seem she will be giving up bright colours any time soon.This was backed up by her daughter-in-law Sophie Wessex, who explained Her Majestyaposs colour palette in the documentary Our Queen at Ninety.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. She explained: Donapost forget that when she turns up somewhere, the crowds are two, three, four, ten,  deep, and someone wants to be able to say they saw a bit of the Queenaposs hat as she went past. She needs to stand out for people to be able to say aposI saw the Queenapos.  The Queen is currently still enjoying her Christmas break after spending the festive season at Windsor Castle.However,  will be a huge year for Her Majesty, who will celebrate  years on the throne.Celebrations for her Plantinum Jubilee will include the -year-old monarch opening her private estates to the public and some of the worldaposs biggest stars performing outside Buckingham Palace. It is not clear which events she will attend or take part in as she was ordered to rest by doctors in October last year following an overnight hospital stay for unspecied preliminary investigations.The bulk of the Jubilee duties are thought likely to be given to the rest of the Royal Family, including the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall. The Queen usually spends the anniversary of her accession privately at Sandringham.

She was pictured making the emotional pilgrimage from Windsor Castle to Sandringham in Norfolk on Sunday morning. She was driven part of the way and then took a helicopter.The couple lived apart in the final years of his le, with the Duke of Edinburgh based at Wood Farm while the Queen stayed at Buckingham Palace. She would regularly travel up to see him when she didnapost have engagements. The couple had only a small team of staff at the Farm, and they didnapost wear unorms as Philip didnapost like the formality. The five-bed cottage, which is tucked away on a quiet part of the estate overlooking the sea, is said to be were able to be a normal couple. The Queen is believed to have cooked and done the washing up during her stays there. Before Prince Philip moved in permanently, Wood Farm was regularly used by other members of the royal family. Kate Middleton stayed there during visits to the estate before she married Prince William. Itaposs also where Sarah Ferguson was made to stay after her orce from Prince Andrew. She wasnapost allowed to attend the Christmas celebrations in the aposBig Houseapos, but wanted to be nearby to see daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. Prince Philip lived alone with assistance from staff at Wood Farm on Sandringham estate after transforming it into a private retreat. He was said to enjoy his time there, tucked away from the other royals, reading, painting watercolours and having friends to stay. A source told Mail Online: Everything is being put in order for the Queenaposs visit,apos one said. aposWeaposve been told that she will stay at Wood Farm, rather than the main house, which is nice as that always had a special place in his heart. The Queen normally marks the tragic anniversary of her fatheraposs death at Sandringham, remaining there after the royal familyaposs Christmas break.  However the spike in Covid cases meant she decided against the traditional family vacation in , and instead spend the holiday at Windsor. February  will mark  year since the King passed away, aged just . It will be the first time the Queen marks the anniversary without Philip by her side. It was the Duke who told his we, then Princess Elizabeth, the devastating news of her fathersapos death. They were on holiday in Kenya at the time. The evening before, the Queen had been taking pictures of the incredible wildle from their tree top hideaway, including baboons, elephants and even a warthog.  The couple got ready to depart for the next stage of their tour, which should have also taken them to New Zealand and Australia. Back in England, at Sandringham, the Kingaposs staff were preparing to wake him for the day. Despite his recent bout of ill health, he had been happy the previous day and had even been on a shoot with a friend. His final acts were to play with his two grandchildren, Charles and Anne, and have dinner with his youngest daughter, Princess Margaret. James McDonald, the Kingaposs valet, realised something was seriously wrong with the monarch when he ran him a bath and he didnapost wake as he usually did. A doctor was called to the palace who confirmed the sad news that King George had passed away in his sleep. But the coupleaposs secluded and isolated location meant it was almost impossible to break the terrible news to the princess that her father was dead. Journalist Granville Roberts, who was covering the royal tour, was the first person to receive the news in Kenya.He immediately told Prince Philipaposs private secretary, Commander Michael Parker, who tuned into the BBC to confirm the news.The Duke of Edinburgh had been taking an afternoon nap and was stunned when he was woken told the sad news. And Prince Philip now had to work out how he would tell his we the tragic news that the father she adored had died and she was now Queen. Rather than tell his we in a formal setting, surrounded by their staff, Philip took her for a walk in the grounds of the lodge they were staying in. It was a private moment for the couple while Elizabeth could be alone with her husband during her moment of grief. Ever aware of her public duty, Elizabeth immediately discussed the practicalities of herto England. But she also asked for an hour alone in her room. The Queenaposswas delayed for several hours due to a storm. Her staff also realised her mourning outfit had already been sent on by plane to the next stop on her royal tour.

And no one is feeling the cold - and the financial pinch - as much as pensioners. The Mirror is calling for VAT on energy bills to be scrapped as rocketing prices look set to push millions into poverty. The annual bill for an average three-bedroom gas-heated home could rise by an inflation-busting £ up to a huge £,, experts estimate. VAT of nearly % is included in what households pay for their gas and electricity. Scrapping it would save £ on the typical annual bill now, but could be worth £ a yeara price cap is hiked as expected in April. Here we reveal the harsh reality of rising energy costs faced by our elderly. Diane Skidmore,  Grandmother Diane Skidmore’s flat is so bitterly cold her grandchildren can’t even visit. The -year-old admits her home leaves all her visitors shivering and her family worried she’ll get pneumonia. But Diane says these are the s she has to go, to keep those rising energy bills down. The mum-of-six and gran to seven, has seen her energy bills soar by % in recent months from £ to £. Speaking from her frosty ground floor flat in Tulse Hill, South London, she said: “A neighbour came in yesterday and I noticed she was shivering. “I said ‘I’m really sorry. Let’s move into the living room’, where the temperature was not much dferent but the sun was shining in.”The former NHS worker gets £ to live on after her rent is paid from her state pension and is dreading the energy bill rises to come.“I live in the cold. My hands are freezing at the moment. Quite often my nose is cold like a dog’s. My kids are worried I will get pneumonia. “My daughters won’t bring the kids around because my house is so cold. They worry about me getting diseases or stuff too. “ Since the pandemic Diane only ventures out to get her prescriptions because she is asthmatic and has been shielding so does not spend any money on luxuries. “I’m very worried the bills are going up because I can’t live any more frugally than I already live,” she explained. “I already don’t turn the heating on most days and I never ever turn the heating on at night. “On the very coldest days I put it on at pm and put the kitchen timer on for half an hour. There is a cold patch around about pm. “I’ve got a bath but I don’t do that a lot to be honest. I’m very low maintenance. “I mostly eat vegetables. I’ve got a gas kettle because electric kettles take up so much energy. “I’m just worried it’s going to be horrible. I have to have faith. I’m not the only one with trouble going on, they have to come up with a solution.” Diane says she has tried other ways to heat her flat by blocking all the air vents and putting a big thick heavy curtain up but said it just causes condensation and black mould. “But I refuse to moan about it because when I was young we didn’t have gas central heating, when it got cold you just put a jumper on or do some exercise,” she said. But then admits: “At night it is very cold in here. “At the moment it’s only one degree at night and I can feel my head and my nose are absolutely verging on damp. I have to go down the bed under the sheets to get warm. “My old neighbour, who died, had a ‘noddy’ hat which he kept on all through winter. He used to sleep in it too. “Maybe I should get a hat.” Jack Mortimer,   Jack Mortimer was part of the ‘greatest generation’ during World War II, helping secure freedom for the world when he was just  years old and “frightened to death”. Regardless of these heroics the D-Day veteran, like many pensioners across the UK, is now living in fear of his energy bills. The -year-old only boils enough water for one cuppa and puts his immersion heating on every other day, to keep his rising energy bills down. At night the main light is switched off as he manages with his single bulb reading lamp only. And the energy “monitor thingy” he’s been given, sits ominously in the corner, constantly catching his eye. Jack has never been one to complain but says: “I don’t know how they can justy the increase. It doesn’t seem to be right but whatever Ofgem can do about it I don’t know. “I have always been economical with electricity. I only boil the amount of water you need for a cup of tea. Every other night I turn off the hot water system. “I have storage heaters and they are quite efficient and it’s cheap electric. “I am concerned the bills are going up because my income only goes up when the Government gives me a pension rise and as soon as they do that they take it off you in some other way. “Nobody seems to be worried about us. It’s like once you get over  they don’t want to know.” He lives alone in his third-floor flat in Leeds as his -year-old we Flo, who has dementia, went into a home last year. He visits her every day from  to pm. And while the couple are due to celebrate their th wedding anniversary next week, sadly they will not be together as they have both tested positive for Covid. His flat is all electric and he complained last year because he seemed to be paying more than his neighbours and a month ago was fitted with a smart meter. “They said I was paying more because I was not paying enough before and owed them nearly £. So I’m paying them in instalments now. These meters don’t seem to be as efficient as they should be,” he said. “I’ve had my meter changed now and yet to receive a new bill so I don’t know what dference that might make.”  He said out of his £ a week pension, he pays a £ monthly direct debit for his electric and pays a monthly rent of £. “I’m keeping my head above water but it is worrying,” he finally admits as he goes through his outgoings. “They have given me a monitor thingy to show how much I’m using. There’s an arc on it and it goes green when I’m doing all right but it goes in the red when I put the oven on. “When I’m sat at night, I don’t put the main bulb on which has three bulbs in it but just put the single light on, it’s not dangerous and is just enough light. “I only use the electric when I have to use it, when it gets dark I put a light on.” Jack was a despatch driver, behind the wheel of a jeep carrying ammunition and mortars on D-Day. He served with th Ordnance Beach Detachment. He landed on Sword Beach, as shells and mortars flew overhead, before advancing on to Caen. He said: “D-Day was a colossal project, you can’t imagine going over the Channel and being so close that you could almost step onto the next boat, there were thousands of them. “It was dangerous, there were snipers around. It was noisy and smoky when we landed, and I remember seeing lots of casualties. “I was  years old and frightened to death, everyone was, the army doesn’t tell you a lot, it gives you orders and you follow them, you don’t get an explanation. “...I was told to come off the beach and turn right, and there was a great big field which I helped to de-mine, then we dug a foxhole... and when you hear a plane approaching you jump straight into the foxhole. “I wouldn’t be here but for the paras who landed near Ranville - there were some big guns there and the paras took them out, otherwise Sword Beach could’ve been shelled out of existence. “ He got married to Flo after ing on leave in  and after the army became a General Manager of a clothing company in Halax making ladies’ blouses. He said previously: “I’m grateful that I’m alive, I’m grateful that I survived and I’m sorry that so many had to die, those were the heroes. “I don’t think I’m a hero, the heroes are the ones who didn’t come home, and they should always be remembered. It is very emotional, of course, to remember those who went and didn’t come back.” Pensioners queueing up for cafes to stay warm  Elderly people have been heading to a shopping centre in Leeds to keep warm and keep their heating bills down at home. At Denicos Italian cafe in Crossgates shopping centre in Leeds staff say some pensioners have been queuing up to come in from the cold - even before they open at .am. Waitress Leah Whitehouse said: “They come as soon as we open at .am. Every single morning. There are two people who sit for three hours and then come again in the afternoon.” Her colleague Tracy Smith, , adds: “They come to keep warm. It is sad and there are definitely more now.” One of their regulars Elizabeth Kumiskey,  and her -year-old husband, Peter, are in their favourite ‘warm spot’ in the middle of the cafe. They point out it’s much colder on the tables nearer the entrance. Former NHS nurse, Peter, explains how their gas was cut off before Christmas because there was a leak and their boiler was condemned. He said they can’t afford to get it fixed as it would take a massive “chunk” out of their savings which they were going to use for a walk-in shower to make it easier for them. “We got several quotes for the central heating and it was about £,. Even with grants offered. “We have savings but I want to keep those for Elizabeth. She is not on a full pension because she brought up five children. It’s an insult what they get! “If I go first I want to leave something for her.” Putting a brave face on their predicament, he adds: “We’ve got a couple of electric fans now so it’s a bit better and we put the snake draft excluder down. We don’t have enough hot water for a bath. “We save money by buying food here. It’s cheaper than buying groceries and putting the oven on and it’s nice.” Elizabeth, clutching her mug of coffee for warmth and wearing a woolly bobble hat, added: “I keep warm when Peter holds my hand.” And about the sacrices they have made to pay their bills, she adds: “You just expect less. We are quite frugal. We would like to go on holiday for a few days, somewhere with a bath maybe.” At a nearby Age UK meeting Margaret Logan, , a former supermarket worker, says she also watches the energy she uses carefully as she pays around £ a quarter. She said: “I don’t have the heating on high just to warm the room a bit. I try not to cook as much with the electric cooker and use my microwave instead. “I like to go out a couple of times a week for a coffee but when the prices go up I might have to stop that.” She adds: “But I’m not too bad. I’m lucky. “The other day I went round to see my friend and she was sat in her big thick coat to keep warm. It was so cold in her house. She had no money because she had bought Christmas presents for her family members”. Jacqueline Lawson, the Leeds coordinator for Age UK, said some pensioners have been putting newspapers to block the drafts in their windows. She added: “I know people who have not been out for two years because of the pandemic so their house is a sanctuary for them. But when they are frightened of putting the heating on - that sanctuary ends up a cold and hostile place. It becomes a cold fridge.” Coldest town in England  It’s the coldest place ever recorded in England. In January , temperatures in Newport, Shropshire, plunged to -. degrees. So where better to talk to people about the impending energy crisis  We bump into Philip and Pat Briscoe, who have been married for  years, on the market town’s main thoroughfare. “We were with Avro,” explained Pat, , speaking of one of the energy firms which collapsed last year, with Ofgem appointing Octopus Energy to take over. “That was last September, so we’ve gone over to Octopus but we don’t know what our rate’s going to be yet. They’ve got too many to deal with so they keep sending us emails telling us we will be able to look at our account soon. “We are concerned but we’re fortunate that we can afford to pay,” added the former receptionist. “If it doubles we will cut down a bit.” “We have to becauseyou pay more for your heating you’re going to be paying more for your food as well,” said Philip, . “Everything’s going up at the moment.” Brian and Celia Styles feel for people who are struggling. “You’re bound to get a higher bill anyway because it’s the winter,” said Celia, . “And until it comes you just don’t know how much. Financially we’re not that bad but a lot of people will struggle. The cost of living and everything’s going up. A lot of people,they’ve lost their jobs, where are they going to get the money from ” “It’s going to go up whatever happens,” added Brian, an -year-old retired industrial engineer. “I just put the heating onI need it but not everyone can do that.” Many older people suggested young people were suffering the most. “I think my monthly bills will go up by %,” said Judy, , a former PA in education. “My electricity is with E.ON and they’ve told me it needs to go up, I’m still waiting on the gas. “You either use the gas or you’re cold which I’m not prepared to be. “The problem is everything has gone up, including food,” she added. “I feel for people who can’t afford the increase - clothing, heating, food, everything’s going up. A lot of people are in poverty now. It’s an awful situation where you have heat or eat. “I feel most sorry for the families just above the limit where they can get help.” “I’m glad I’m at the end and not the beginning,” said Judy as she headed off to finish her shopping. “I feel for my grandchildren.

Daniel, a third-year photography student, and his partner, Mary Cullen, , who live in Totnes, Devon, spent three months converting the  Citroen Relay van as a lockdown project over the summer of . Living in a van allows them to save more than £, on rent and utility bills each year.Have you got an unusual living situation  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story Daniel said: It was always my plan to have my own home by my third year of university, specically a home that was minimalist and one that I could travel around in. I saved up the money to convert a van, as I didnapost want to pay the high rent of a student flat for a year. It would have cost me £ alone just to live in student accommodation for ten months. Having a converted van is really a future financial asset to me now, Iaposm saving money by not having to spend it on bills or extortionate accommodation rent.  Mary, a freelance graphic designer, added: Before I met Daniel, I never thought about living in a van but itaposs just so convenient and thereaposs so many adventures that we have yet to plan. I miss having a toaster, as we have to fry our toast, but I have really come to enjoy van le and when living on the road, you come to realise you donapost need the same electrical appliances most households canapost go without. The Plymouth College of Art student first purchased his van for £, in March , and spent a further £, on renovations, including a £ eco-friendly solar electrical system. The van boasts a hob to cook on, storage for clothes and food, a compost toilet, a kitchen counter and even a double bed to make for a cosy home on wheels.  Daniel said: The batteries and solar electrical system were probably the most expensive part of the renovation, but it was worth the money as it was the price of what someone would spend a year on their electrical bills. To light the van, I got some fairy lights and LED lights to make it look homely, they were £ and really light up the small space. I managed to get a second-hand Welsh dresser for £ that I broke down and converted into the kitchen counter where I store the pots and pans. I also created a compost toilet for £ from scrap pieces of wood, a bucket, and iders for solids and liquids. It might sound weird, but the toilet is my favourite part of the renovation. I use a coconut peat, and a vinegar solution to neutralise the smells and as itaposs compostable, itaposs all very environmentally friendly. One the most luxury items in the van is the l camper fridge that cost £, itaposs usually cool enough to hold ice cream which is a nice treat. Daniel used scrap wood to create the bed with room for storage underneath, as well as adding a food cupboard and hooks for to the inside of the van for coffee mugs. Everything inside of the van is multipurpose, with seating including a storage box and the compostable toilet. Despite enjoying the simplicities of van le, the couple have had to make a series of compromises in order to live on the road. Mary said: We both kind of miss hot running water, so we have to shower at campsites and use laundrettes when travelling. Iaposm a notorious clothes hoarder, so when I moved into the van with Daniel, I had to cull a lot of things, only to realise I never really needed them anyway. Daniel continued: Van le is all about improvising and doing things that may not be considered the norm. Van le allows you to be as low impact and eco-friendly as possible whilst being able to travel as much as you like.The couple have plans to travel through Europe once most Covid- restrictions are lted and Daniel finishes university.The price breakdown The Van,  Citroen Relay MWB £, Paint for the outside of the van £ Interior wood, Ply and Cladding £ Roof rack £ Insulation £ Windows £ Roof vent fan £ Swivel chair base £ Solar  and charge controller £ Batteries £ Battery to battery charger £ Fridge £ Mattress £ Wiring £ Led Lights £ Fairy lights £ Diesel heater £ Compost toilet £ Second hand welsh dresser £ Sink and tap £  burner hob £ Tools for the build £ Endless trips to screwfix £ Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CitroenEducationStudents\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Now, the Met Office is warning of ‘severe frost’ and icy conditions for the start of the week on Monday with a deep freeze set to sweep across England and Wales.  And snow could fall in Scotland as well as parts of northern England from Thursday. Long range predictions by the Met Office also state that snow might fall in northern regions from early February as the freezing temperatures continue. Before then, on Monday, forecasters predict that in the south it will remain cold but with the promise of brighter intervals, with similar conditions in the north, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  For Tuesday and Wednesday there will be occasional rain in the northwest which will move south on Thursday, bringing potentially heavy showers.The coldest weather will begin from Thursday onwards.A spokesman for the Met Office said: It will turn very briefly colder on Thursday and as conditions move south it will bring showers with it.  Across England and Wales it will remain largely dry for the week, there will be more in the western areas of Scotland. But forecasters said the chance of widespread snow this week was not expected, and flurries would largely stay on higher parts of Scotland. UK Weather Forecast Today: Cold and cloudy but dry for most areas today. A few bright or sunny spells are likely in some areas, mainly eastern Scotland, northeast England and, perhaps, parts of Wales. Thicker cloud will bring northern Scotland rain at times. Tonight: Most areas remaining cold and cloudy tonight, cloud over parts of northern Scotland thick enough for some rain at times. Tuesday: Another cloudy day follows on Tuesday, cloud over northern Scotland thick enough for some rain, mainly later. Probably a few breaks in the east. Feeling cold. Outlook for Wednesday to Friday: Changeable largely dry for most, any rain predominantly affecting western coasts and hills, especially the Highlands and Islands. Breezy, with risk of gales in the far north at times. Mild.

Later on Monday in the south it will remain cold but with the possible promise of brighter intervals, with similar conditions in the north, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For Tuesday and Wednesday there will be occasional rain in the northwest which will move south on Thursday, bringing potentially heavy showers. A spokesman for the Met Office said: “It will turn very briefly colder on Thursday and as conditions move south it will bring showers with it.  “Across England and Wales it will remain largely dry for the week, there will be more in the western areas of Scotland.” Brits worried about the possibility of the arrival of snow can relax however as it is not expected this week. He added: “There could be some in the highest ground of Scotland on some of the mountains. “Nothing  wintry is expected at all.” It comes as  was officially named the joint sixth warmest year since records began  years ago.  The Met Office warned global warming and other long-term climate change trends are expected to continue as a result of record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Dr Colin Morice, of the Met Office, said: “ is one of the warmest years on record, continuing a series of measurements of a world that is warming under the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. This extends a streak of notably warm years from  to  - the warmest seven years in over  years of measurements.”  Prof Tim Osborn, of the University of East Anglia, added: “Each year tends to be a little below or a little above the underlying long-term global warming. “Global temperature data analysed by the Met Office and UEAaposs Climatic Research Unit show  was a little below, while  had been a little above, the underlying warming trend. “All years, including , are consistent with long-standing predictions of warming due to human activities.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeUniversity of East AngliaSnowClimate changeWeather\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The new witness reportedly insists Christian Brueckner was calm while she was with him and says they were stopped by police who reported no suspicious activity. The German witness, who was living in Portugal in , believes Brueckner was miles away from Praia da Luz in Portugal on the day Madeleine went missing from a resort there. A source told the Sun: She says she was not with him the day Madel­eine disappeared but spoke with him and again said he seemed normal. The source said: This ­testimony could be an issue.  This comes just days after German journalists who were investigating the case claimed they have uncovered “shocking” evidence which “heavily incriminates” Brueckner. British youngster Madeleine was just three-years-old when she vanished from her parents’ holiday apartment in Portugal in . German prosecutors claim to have evidence she is dead and named convicted paedophile Christian Brueckner as their only suspect. Despite going public with the information in June , they have still not charged him with any offence.  But now a team working for TV channel Sat. have handed the evidence to detectives probing Brueckner over the infamous case. Sat. investigators claim to have found fresh evidence linking Brueckner, who denies any involvement, to the crime. They will reveal more information about their investigation in a prime-time documentary, which is yet to have an air date. Announcing the show, Sat. said journalist Jutta Rabe and a team of reporters gathered new information about Brueckner. They claim it includes proof he was near Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished while her parents dined in a tapas restaurant. The channel said they collected “many new clues and indications” that corroborate the suspicions of German prosecutors.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Christian BMadeleine MccannMissing persons\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She has a lot of separation anxiety.  The little girl lost seven pounds through the harrowing ordeal and has been left severely traumatised. Laboyaposs lawyer, Seth Harris, says Lyric has been slapping her dad while heaposs sleeping to make sure heaposs alive. The homelessness department has denied the youngster was left alone for five days, but did not provide details on how long she was left. They told the New York Post the incident is under investigation and has already sparked changes in the way they work. The shelter now conducts same-night wellness checks for residents who fail to sign the evening register, they say. Shelbi - who was separated from dad Quraan - had moved into an apartment-like unit at the homeless shelter around three or four months before her death, according to documents filed at Manhattanaposs Supreme Court. It wasnapost until a resident in a neighbouring unit smelled a foul odour coming from Shelbiaposs room that the alarm was raised, legal papers say. Another lawyer for Laboy, Allison Keenan, claims the mumaposs last sign-in date at the shelter was six days before her body was discovered. Harris told the New York Post: “It’s amazing that she’s alive. Keenan said: “Allowing an infant to remain with her dead mother for five days unnoticed not only highlights the indference and lack of humanity shown to those most in need but exhibits complete malfeasance by the City of New York and Department of Homeless Services.  Lyric is now in a far better physical condition after regaining all the weight she initially lost. But Quraan says she still cries out for her mum nearly every night. “She always wakes up in the middle of the night, she’s kicking, she’s fighting, saying, ‘Mommy,’ I look at her and I just start tearing up sometimes,” he said. Quraan has left his job to take care of his daughter - who is his number one priority now.

Homicide detectives in Atlanta, Georgia, say the shot was fired up to ft away to where Dr Matthew Willson was hit in the head. The bullet had travelled through the exterior wall of a block of flats before striking the Brit, , as he was in bed with his girlfriend, Katherine Shepard. The -year-old American has told how she cradled him in her arms as he died. Ms Shepard, who had dated Dr Willson, from Chertsey, Surrey, for three years, said: “He was supposed to be here for three months because we’ve been long distance for a while. “I picked him up from the airport, took him to his favourite eating location – and the next day he’s gone.”  She said she remains “in disbelief” over the tragedy. Recalling the harrowing moment last week she added: “I turned to Matthew and said, ‘I’m going to call the cops.’ “His last words were, ‘Sure, I’m sure they are just messing around.’  “I was kneeling on my bed looking out of the window to seeI could see anything. I felt the bed move, Matt was possibly getting up, and there was a tiny explosion in our room. “Then I heard Matt’s breathing change and I askedhe was OK.” Ms Shepard said she turned on the light, adding: “He had started to slump over. I saw he’d been shot in the head and started screaming. “I knelt on the bed holding a towel to his head and talking to him and shaking him whenever he started closing his eyes. He looked like he was looking at me, but he wasn’t talking at all and he was struggling to breathe. “I just felt panic. While we were waiting for the ambulance there were more gunshots fired.” Her flatmate, Aman Kar, called  immediately, but by the time an ambulance arrived  minutes later Dr Willson was unresponsive.  He was pronounced dead in a local hospital a short time later. An Atlanta police spokesman said: “We do not believe this is gang-related. We believe this is a random act of iniduals discharging firearms recklessly. No arrests have been made. The area is considered a generally safe area. We don’t typically deal with a whole lot of gun violence.” The Foreign Office said it was “supporting the family of a British man following his death”.

Only changing your bed sheets once a week  WRONG.But the latest tip comes from a very creditable source, and even the Queen trusts him. Chef Jeff Baker says a lot of people make a common mistake when cooking the meat, which is why it ends up being very greasy. And heaposs previously cooked for the Queen - so he clearly knows what heaposs talking about when it comes to the kitchen.Speaking to Daily Star, he says itaposs all to do with getting the pan nice and hot, rather than cooking the meat slow and steady. By doing it this way, the bacon should caramelise, making it crispier and giving the meat a punchier flavour.He explained: I find that the best way to cook bacon is on a medium to high heat pan with a small amount of natural fat, searing it on each side for a minute or so.If the bacon is properly dry-cured and cut to a nice thickness, it should caramelise on the edges.  The fat will then render without dissolving, resulting in delicious flavour.The chef, who works with online butchery retailer Farmison  Co also shared another top tip - but itaposs pretty controversial.He continued to say that he doesnapost think you should add any condiments to your bacon, so wave goodbye to ketchup or brown sauce.Do you have a food or cooking hack to share  We want to hear all about it. Email us at yourmirror@mirror In my opinion,cooked this way the bacon won’t need any sauce to enhance the taste - it’ll be perfect as it is, he said. The chef also claimed weaposve been making similar mistakes when cooking curry as well. Apparently, we should be heating the spices in oil before cooking to intensy the flavours. To ‘temper’ your spices means to heat them up in oil to bring out their flavours, he explained. It’s a simple, quick step that reaps rewards when it comes to enhancing your dish and intensying the flavours from the spices. Once you start doing this, you’ll really notice the dference, and it’ll just become part of the curry cooking process.

I know something you donapost, I know something youaposll never know, she mouthed in the clip, before it cut to her throwing a big old pile of homework in the bin. Yep, the bin.

Itaposs a long time since weaposve been set any homework, weaposve got to admit, it still stings a little. We call that aposfiling it awayapos, one teacher commented, while another added: aposThis is going to be gradedapos - trashes it a week later. A third teacher wrote: I use to bring it home to throw it out because I had some irrational fear of the work being found in my classroom garbage and getting in trouble.

Paul Lang, , took up the job in July  as lockdown meant he couldnapost make films.He describes it as a privilege and says itaposs made him appreciate the people who do jobs we all take for granted.Paul has seen some weird and wonderful things in the last  months, including a man in his s wearing a baffling outfit. And heaposs also discovered the four-word phrase that all delivery drivers absolutely hate. Heaposs turned his experiences into a book, From Hollywood to Cricklewood: Delivering during a Pandemic. You have a unique window into someone’s le - it’s humbling, funny, sad, frustrating and a real privilege, he told The Sun.One time a man in his eighties answered the door wearing rubber gloves, a face mask, a transparent apron and old flip flops held onto his feet by parcel tape – and nothing . I didn’t quite know where to look. But for Paul, the worst part of the job is checking a customeraposs delivery details and seeing a certain phrase. He said: When you find it’s up four floors with no lt and you have  trays of food your heart sinks - I do dread the words, “th Floor, No Lt. The same thing happens with water - gallons of it.

I hate them more than you do. And impatiently waving your product in front of the scanner isnapost going to make my le any easier. I hold the power to unlock these bad boys, and the red light flashing above you has already told me you need my help.

People store anything and everything in their lofts, from suitcases, to old photo albums to Christmas decorations, but have we ever stopped to think about what we should be putting up there, and more importantly, what we shouldnapost It turns out there are several common items that are regularly stored in peopleaposs lofts which could be doing more harm than good. The Liverpool Echo spoke to Joyce French, cleaning expert at HomeHow, who outlines the seven things you should never store in the loft. Electronics Got an old cassette player or Gameboy gathering dust in the attic  Everyone has outdated electronics that they just can’t let go of. However, old electronics can still overheat in the loft. The circuitry can blow and ruin your item forever - so it’s best to keep beloved electronics in a cooler environment downstairs, take them to a recycling centre, or sell them online. Holiday decorations As our Christmas decorations come down and the New Year begins, it is time to store away your holiday décor. But next yearaposs festive season could be a lot less merryyou keep the decorations in the loft. Delicate fabrics, items that are painted, and special plastic ornaments may warp in the heat and are prone to damage in a humid environment, like the attic. Instead, store holiday decorations in a large plastic container box in a cool environment, such as the garage.  Wooden furniture Maybe youaposve inherited antique wooden furniture and itaposs not quite your style, but you donapost want to throw it away. It may be tempting to store it in the loft, but you shouldnapost - as wood can warp in the damp, crack in the heat, and grow mould in humid conditions. Wood also tends to attract woodworm, which can eat away at wood furniture. Paint After doing up the house, you may have leftover paint, but oil-based paints can heat up to hazardous, combustible levelsstored in a hot roofspace. They are highly flammable, so should be kept in a temperature-controlled spot, like a spare cabinet. The dramatic temperature fluctuations can break down latex paint too, making it unusable.  Important documents Many of us keep important documents, such as birth certicates and passports, together in one place. But the loft is one of the worst places to keep these, as they donapost hold up well with temperature fluctuations. Your important documents will begin to fade, get damp, dusty or stick together as time goes on. Invest in a storage drawer unit for documents you need and bring them downstairs. Cardboard boxes If you’re storing things in cardboard boxes in your attic, it may be time to reconsider. Pests like mice and bugs are attracted to cardboard and glue, feeding off it and making it their home for breeding. Cardboard boxes also tend to become damp and disintegrate over time, potentially damaging the precious items inside. Food and wine Some lofts can reach temps high enough in the summer to cook canned goods, so foods that are safe enough to store away for a long time shouldn’t be kept here. As well as this, unsuitable warm temperatures can spoil expensive wines. Pests such as mice and rats thrive in a humid attic environment, and can also contaminate and chew through food items. Instead, store perishables and wine in a cool, dry place so they are safe for consumption after a long term.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Declan Haughney, , insists that he was not trying to rob his deceased relative Peadar Doyle, , after he and another man dragged him for five minutes from his home to collect his pension from a Post Office in Hoseys, Ireland last Friday morning.Declan, , claimed he’s now “the talk of the town” and has been branded a “murderer” in the local community ever since the sensational story emerged, the Irish Mirror reports.But he insisted he’s “not an eejit” – and believes he’s being accused of dragging his dead uncle into a post office to rob his pension – because he previously stole from his aunt. He said: “Why would I want to rob my uncle  I’m  years of age yeah, I’m not a child, I’m not a young fella. I’m not an eejit to walk into Hoseys with a dead man and collect his money. Am I cuckoo  Am I cuckoo  I’m not.”  Declan, who admits he used to have a drug problem, and who served two years in prison, says he’s now being accused of knowingly bringing his dead uncle in to get his pension – because of his past. He told us: “That’s why they’re saying it, that’s why this is all coming up now – because I done it before. A bank card came through the aunt’s door and I got the pin code and went down for fraud and that’s why this is all coming up. “People know about that in the town you know. But that was  years ago. I’m off the gear three years and I’m doing well.”  And Declan, who has a black eye and facial injuries after allegedly being attacked following the incident last Friday, revealed that he now believes his uncle was dead before he even reached the post office. Declan says he believes Peadar may have been dead by the time he and another male got him under the bridge at Pollerton Road, which is less than a two-minute walk from his home – but the pair continued to bring him to the post office by linking arms with him and dragging him there.  When the pair propped Mr Doyle up against the counter a member of staff contacted the Irish gardai.Both men, one of whom is said to have known Mr Doyle ‘very well’, have since made full statements to the police investigating the incident from Friday, Daily Record reports. Officers believe he may have died around three hours before his impromptu trip to Hosey’s newsagents and post office in Carlow with the men, despite the claims that he was alive. Fr John Dunphy, the priest who delivered the last rites to Mt Doyle, said he received a call from police saying his remains had been left at the shop in ‘shocking circumstances.’ Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Post OfficePensionsCrimeFunerals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This is definitely very unusual that someone was able to survive the cold at such a height - very, very unusual. A spokesperson for freight carrier Cargolux confirmed that the stowaway had been on a flight operated by Cargolux Italia. We are not in a position to make any further comment until the authorities and the airline have completed their investigation, they said. The only Cargolux freight flight arriving at Schiphol on Sunday was a Boeing  freighter that travelled from Johannesburg and made a stop in Nairobi, Kenya, according to Schipholaposs website and flight tracking data. A spokesperson for the airport declined to answer questions about the incident, according to Reuters. It comes after another man survived a gruelling flight while hiding in the landing gear. In November last year a man was found alive and well after stowing away in the landing gear of a plane traveling from Guatemala to Miami.

The conclusion we’ve come it is that we are not going to get to the bottom of this till we talk to the people themselves, the kids who are getting involved in this and that’s where we are putting our effort at the moment.“We have secured the assistance of the local high school who are going to work with us on this, maybe through focus groups and with a little bit of talk perhaps we can find a solution.”Sergeant David Rourke said: “I don’t have all the answers and I’ll not pretend that I do. I wish I did, but I certainly believe what we need to do is engage the children and youths of the communities a lot better.“So what we’ve been trying to do is work in partnership with the high schools, the community council in Peebles and ious other organisations such as Youth Action Teams to address and ert the youth’s attentions from vandalisms such as what has happened in the play park to more productive activities around the region.“Generally when we have vandalism or any sort of crime we have feedback such as ‘where were the police’ or ‘what are the police doing to resolve this ’“The police cannot resolve this on their own. Resourcing levels as we know across the board in the UK as a whole means we cant have police officers on every street corner every minute of the day to prevent crime happening so what we need to do is work as communities to spot it happening in the first place.”.removeA number of groups in the area have also stepped up to help.Lori Lee from the Community Sports Hub said: “We’ve been working hard to try and get sport back up on the table and that’s something during COVID we have been unable to do. So the opportunity hasn’t been there for young people to get out and be active in sport and potentially this is a reason behind anti-social behaviour.”And Dave Hodson from Tweeddale Youth Action added: “Through our youth clubs in Peebles and Innerleithen we continue to offer activities and opportunities for young people to have fun. We offer a place where young people can access support, advice and where we can signpost further services.“And really through volunteering opportunities we try and foster a sense of community spirit within our young people.“It’s important to say as well that the vast majority of our young people do play an active role in community le and are fantastic.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-men-admit-jedburgh-high-street-clothing-shop-raid","story":"BACKGROUND reports have been ordered into two Borders men following a raid on a Borders clothing store.Thirty-year-old Andrew Clamp, of Hawick, pleaded guilty to a charge of theft by housebreaking at the premises of David Thomson  Son outfitters in High Street, Jedburgh, on November , .He also admitted the theft of a vehicle.Co-accused Scott Shearman, , pleaded guilty to the reset of shirts, jumpers, coats and jeans stolen from the shop which were found at his home in Howdenbank, Hawick, on November .He also admitted obstructing police and instructing his dog to attack a police officer.:Anti-vaccine group hack Scottish Borders Councils Twitter accountJedburgh Sherf Court was told that the dog bit Shearman on his arm instead.The court also heard that £, worth of clothing was stolen in the Jedburgh shop raid with £ worth of clothing recovered.Sentence was deferred until February  for the production of a Criminal Justice Social Work Report.Clamp also admitted assaulting two men with a metal pole on August  last year in Wellfield Road, Hawick.

We were observed to have less than one per cent discards and, of that, only a point of a percentage was cod.#There#s really nothing scientic behind this, it#s all political.#The CFA was due to meet

This clearly calls into question the purpose and legitimacy of an ad hoc body whose participants, other than Sir Geoff, are operating under the cloak of anonymity.I was recently invited to send in a response to a long, rambling box-ticking public consultation survey from this secretive commissariat. It had all the hallmarks of one of those questionnaires which seek to pre-determine the desired response. Whatever authority this body has been granted by Edinburgh City Council or Edinburgh University, it should certainly not be entrusted with the power of le or death over the city’s monuments and memorials.This is not to say the suitability of such things should not be reviewed from time to time. About  yards north of Dundas’s column, there is a bronze plaque to Marie Stopes, a proponent of eugenics who favoured contraception as a means of controlling the birth rate of the lower orders, and sent love poems to a man she particularly admired, Adolf Hitler. I imagine few,any, would objectthis was removed and scrapped, but presumably, since her defects do not fall under the heading of Slavery or Colonialism, it will be staying in place.Questions inevitably arise as to whether, say, the removal of the statue of Dundas, a listed artefact, on the recommendation of this anonymous body would be lawful. Last year the suggestion that a plaque be fixed to his column to place his effigy in historic context seemed like a reasonable compromise however those entrusted with the wording decided to distort history by omitting all reference to the fact that it was Dundas, as a young Lord Advocate, who successfully – and passionately – defended the former slave, Joseph Knight, and then went on to steer William Wilberforce’s abolition bill through the House of Commons.Bearing in mind that Martin Luther King, in The Purpose of Education, wrote that we should resist allowing our minds \"to become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda\" it can reasonably be concluded that the plaque is a travesty.It seems obvious that such manipulation of history, together with the recent savage attacks on members of our academic community, require the attentions of a Scottish Government inquiry led by qualied lawyers and historians who actually know what they are talking about.David J Black, Edinburgh.IN DEFENCE OF DUNDASI WRITE in support of the excellent articles by Iain Macwhirterand Stuart Waiton , both exposing the disturbing side to the current campaigns by the city of Edinburgh and the University of Edinburgh to publicly demonstrate the correctness of their racial credentials. The council’s Slavery and Colonialism Review Group is casting its net far and wide in an endeavour to identy anything and anybody associated with Edinburgh who can be linked in some way with slavery or to the British Empire. Even David Livingstone and the Royal Botanic Garden have been included as possible culprits by the Review. Furthermore, the treatment of David Hume on the part of the university has been shameful – as have been the actions of those who attack critics like Professor Sir Tom Devine by labelling them as \"racist\". I just wish the Review zealots would make sure that they get their historical facts right before they rush to criticism.There can be no doubt that Henry Dundas was a scoundrel. He was heavy drinker, a womaniser and a man who shamelessly used his considerable powers of patronage to help his friends, particularly fellow Scots. However, to continue to place all of the blame on Dundas for the delay in the abolition of the slave trade is I think unfair and ignores the reality of the tumultuous years of the early s. Those attacking Henry Dundas have to address the question as to how a slave-supporting Parliament at that time was ever going to vote for abolition. Britain was then at war with Revolutionary France and was faced with the real prospect of invasion. Furthermore, the British establishment was terried that the success of the French Revolution might inspire similar uprisings in the UK. The country was in turmoil and it fell to Dundas to try to restore order at home and to meet the French threat.Realistically in the s there was very little chance for legislation to abolish slavery to succeed in Parliament. A previous attempt to pass a motion for abolition had been very heavily defeated. Dundas knew perfectly well that Parliament was packed with members who had strong vested interests in the slave trade. It would take years for the force of the moral argument against the vile trade to have any chance of success. During the debate in  he proposed a gradual path to abolition stating that \"my opinion has been always against the slave trade\". Indeed it was Dundas who had taken on the case of the West Indian slave Joseph Knight in  which successfully established that there was no slavery in Scotland. Dundas concluded his remarks in the Court of Session by stating: \"Human nature, my Lords, spurns at the thought of slavery among any part of our species.”‬‬‬‬‬ So it is quite wrong to state that Dundas was fighting a rearguard action against abolition and that he alone was responsible for condemning some , Africans to the horrors of slavery.‬Eric Melvin, Edinburgh.* IAIN Macwhirter and Stuart Waiton are correct about the increasing adolescent attitudes in our universities, local authorities and society generally, particularly when luminaries such as Sir Tom Devine and Professor Johnathan Hearn are insulted as racists. It is akin to traducing JK Rowling for her common-sense response to the fatuous moves by officialdom to abandon a word used since time immemorial to describe a female person.Mr Macwhirter might also have mentioned that Viscount Dundas, by postponing the slave trade’s abolition by  years until , possibly ensured that the trade did not continue thereafter, for  years or much longer. The new explanatory plaque installed on the Dundas monument should include this point too. It is sad that an otherwise-eminent professor like Sir Geoff Palmer should tarnish his reputation by such insults and thus undermine the objectivity of his review into Edinburgh’s involvement in slavery.Last March he ascribed a “racist element” to the medics’ reaction when his we gave birth to their first-born in . As he was not present, and the staff did not know he was Jamaican, they were understandably concerned that the baby’s colouring might indicate something medically wrong .He then linked this out of context with David Hume’s brief nuanced footnote about non-whites’ “inferiority”, said “this is the statement that killed George Floyd”and led “to the incident that Meghan and Harry talk about” .John Birkett, St Andrews.SHAMEFUL TREATMENT OF FEMALE OAPsMANY womens entitlement to a state pension has been systematically exploited by Westminster governments over the years. First we have the scandal of the Waspigroup, women born in the early s who were not afforded the Government’s own rules of notice of an increase to their state pension age. Now we hear that women awarded a small state pension on their own right were ultimately eligible to claim  per cent of the basic state pension, based on their husbands contributions, something the women affected were not made aware of. This anomaly was highlighted as far back as during the Coalition Governments time in officeby the then Work and Pensions Secretary Steve Webb, yet only now do we hear any call for justice.This is a scandal of monumental proportions because it affects well in excess of , women, many of whom have existed in poverty, with deteriorating health, unable to correctly look after themselves due to a lack of income. Many hundreds of hours of debate on the plight of the Waspi women have been heard in the House of Commons there has been cross-party agreement for justice, yet the Westminster Governments exploitation of women and state pensions continues. Becoming a pensioner should be a good experience, an experience of \"well done\" after an average of  years of work, so it is quite galling to learn that the Government has been exploiting your entitlement to a state pension.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-support-available-amid-rising-tide-mortgage-arrears","story":"The arrival of the pandemic in early  set off a financial earthquake and sparked fears about the effects on millions of households.While a slew of state interventions including support grants, an uplt in Universal Credit and furlough undoubtedly helped we continue to see powerful aftershocks rip through household budgets as the Treasury has withdrawn many of these measures and the cost of living has rocketed.There is currently such a multitude of financial hardships facing people across the country that it can be hard to keep up and accordingly the growing issue of mortgage arrears often slips below the radar.Across the Citizens Advice network in Scotland, we have seen worrying and sustained growth in demand for support with mortgage arrears. Our most recent national data shows that between July and September of , the network provided more than  pieces of advice on mortgage arrears. While this may not sound drastic, the growth in demand should set alarm bells ringing in government, as a proportion of all advice it represents a % increase compared to the same period in .Perhaps most worryingly is that the rising demand appears likely to continue through . This is in part a result of the fact that mortgage-holders receiving Universal Credit can only get help with housing costs after claiming for nine months and are not able to have any earned income or breaks in this period. This issue has become particularly acute given many mortgage-holders moved on to Universal Credit during the pandemic and therefore were vulnerable to building up arrears on mortgage payments.There are well-justied fears that the numbers struggling with arrears will continue to grow as we move further into the year and pandemic support measures including mortgage payment holidays end.This is compounded by the fact that there is no sign of the rapid rises in cost of living slowing down as inflation and energy prices rise and incomes stagnant or fall in real terms. Indeed, following the Bank of England’s decision to raise interest rates, some mortgage-holders may also see their monthly repayments rise.Lenders are legally obliged to treat you fairly and consider any request to change the way you pay your mortgage they are expected to do everything possible to come to a payment arrangement and repossessing your home should be the last resort.While this requirement is of course a good thing it frankly will not be enough for many. What mortgage-holders facing arrears need is additional support from policymakers.The UK and Scottish Governments rightly said nobody should lose their home because of the pandemic and with the financial ripple effects set to continue support must be in place to ensure this becomes a reality.In the meantime, the situation facing many is intimidating but people who are struggling with money aren’t alone – the Citizens Advice network is here to help and can support you with a wide range of financial hardships. The network has helped over , people in Scotland during the pandemic with a vast range of issues and unlocked around £million overall in the process.So,you are feeling financially overwhelmed the Citizens Advice network is available online or at your local bureau with free, confidential and impartial expert advice.Aoe Deery is Senior Social Justice Policy Officer at Citizens Advice Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"flinty-mcstags-excruciating-edinburgh-return-loan-deal-loopholes-monday-kick-off","story":"Its pretty clear which clubs this kind of loophole-closing is aimed at. Clue: it isnt ones in the Scottish Professional Football League. Only those living in a cave could have failed to notice the cottage-industry going on at Chain recent seasons, whereby clubs owned by some of the richest men on the planet have stockpiled a weapons-grade amount of talented youngsters and then flogged them for loan fees – and subsequently large transfer fees – to balance the Financial Fair Play books over the years. At one point last season, the London outfit had  players parked at ious clubs around Europe. That follows a long-running trend by the Stamford Bridge club. They employed this strategy most notably at Vitesse Arnhem, where they would simply park any number of up-and-coming iniduals to either groom for their own first teamor with a view to fattening their geese for selling at the market.Celtics Islam Feruz learned the hard way the downside of entering the Cha loan system – a kind of brand repackaging factory that allows the Londoners to slap a Harrods-style sticker on to its goods – and is now no longer in the game in part because of poor handling by his advisers but also as a result of poor loan choicesby his club and weve already seen the travails experienced by a similarly ill-conceived move for Billy Gilmour to Norwich City.The rule changes are welcome but the new regulations dont really go far enough. For a start, they will not affect players under the age of  or those who have been club-trained and thus it will not limit their respective clubs ability to loan them out – the exact category that Gilmour and Feruz is was in.Off with his headEdinburgh announced the  of mascot Flinty McStag in an excruciating social media post last week in which current first-team stars speculated on the peak physical condition the oversized plush toy had got himself into.

Oranje legend Johann Neeskens did not disappoint: there was an air of mystery about him, and his tobacco-tinged accent seemed to give him a gravitas not just because of the lucidity of his arguments but because he was well-versed enough to be making them about Scottish football and its importance on the world stage. At no point did I stammer or stutter in his company, however. Laura Muir was a dferent matter altogether, though. As part of said sports editor duties I was present the night she was awarded Scottish athlete of the year for  and was introduced to her as a sponsor. But boy could I think of anything to say to her. Starstruck  Possibly. I shall watch with intrigue as she goes in search of the m world indoor record in Birmingham next month – not least because it is the same venue where she broke the European indoor record, simultaneously setting the second fastest time ever over the distance in .Bolognas secret sauceIf youve been paying attention over recent seasons youll know that Bologna have become one of the most astute clubs in European football for talent identication. There is a clear pattern of second- and third-tier outfits across the continent who have come to the conclusion that in order to remain relatively competitive in a financial and playing capacity then buying promising youngsters cheaply and selling them for exponentially higher fees is a sound business model. It is one Bologna have embraced with gusto. In their efforts to look under every stone they have already bought Aaron Hickey to the club. Meanwhile, Luis Binks, a very highly-rated Scotland eligible centre-back who was Thierry Henrys first signing for FC Toronto, also arrived in Emilia-Romagna in . Hickey found himself playing at right back in Fridays - defeat by Bologna – left-backs playing out of position was a feature of a previous Monday kick-off – which is perhaps the reason why the Serie A outfit are now weighing up a bid for Aberdeens Calvin Ramsay for the opposite flank to Hickey.January is a notoriously dficult month to do business. It is a cliché that has become so ubiquitous when discussing the winter transfer window that it is almost possible to believe it is actually true. Its easy to see why that might might prevail but it doesn not stand up to scrutiny. Last year only £m was spent by Premier League clubs in the month but it was clearly an outlay that was affected by the ongoing financial restrictions placed on clubs because of the pandemic. A year earlier clubs in Englands top flight chucked £m at solving their respective problems. In Scotland, while most players switched clubs for free or on loan deals, there were still  transfers registered in and out of the country during January and early February – more than a quarter of which took place on deadline day. A sign of theto a semblance of financial prosperity – or perhaps desperation– comes with the revelation that for this month alone  transfers – just three less than all of last years equivalent window – have already been signed off by the Scottish Football Association.The number of shots Scott Jamieson dropped in his first five holes at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship as a cheque for million slithered from the one-shot overnight leaders grasp in the first hour or so of play in the UAE."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

In the ferry’s absence other services on the CalMac timetable had been affected.He said at the time: “I entirely recognise the intolerable nature of the situation for islanders. I also realise what they want is action rather than warm words.\"He was at the centre of a row over a planned ScotRail rail strike which threatened to hit the COP Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. And there was concern over ScotRail plans to cut services in a new timetable after the services move to state ownership.More recently he has come under fire over plans for ScotRail, which is to become nationalised in March, for forthcoming ticket office closures and reduced opening hours in stations across the country.In a stinging letter the Aslef union urged Mr Dey to \"stop being an armchair transport secretary\" and intervene to protect the new publicly-owned ScotRail by rejecting the current cuts agenda.In his resignation letter, Mr Dey said he intended to focus on \"improving my health and wellbeing and on giving more attention to my family, while also continuing as MSP for Angus South to serve the needs and interests of the people of the constituency\".He told the First Minister: \"Please also be assured of my commitment to support the governments work and priorities as a member of the SNP parliamentary group.\"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “This is the right decision for Graeme to reach at this time, and he leaves government with my very best wishes.“He has been a highly effective minister and steps down with many achievements to his name. As Minister for Parliamentary Business, he built trust and confidence across the political spectrum to navigate a period of minority government, and ensure that government remained accountable to Parliament throughout the period of lockdown earlier in the pandemic.“As Transport Minister, Graeme played a huge part in ensuring the success of COP. He has also delivered concessionary bus travel for under-s, set out plans to reduce car travel to meet climate targets, and prepared the ground for theof Scotland’s railway to public ownership.“Amongst his many responsibilities, I know that Graeme particularly valued his time as Minister for Veterans. In that role, he secured additional funding for veteran services and I have no doubt that the veteran community will continue to benefit from his support as a backbench MSP.“Circumstances permitting, the door will always be open should Graeme wish ato government in future. In the meantime, I wish him well and know that he will continue to serve his Angus constituents with drive and commitment.”His resignation come as  ScotRail was to transition at the end of March into  \"operator of last resort arrangements\" after ministers decide it was not the right time to seek a franchise procurement competition to run Scotlands railways after Dutch state-owned transport firm Abellio ended its control.At the end of , ministers announced it had stripped Abellio of the franchise three years early in the wake of continuing outcry over service failings and rising costs to the taxpayer.Abellios franchise loss came after ScotRail was forced to submit a plan by February, , to address falling performance levels which,unsuccessful, would have resulted in a breach of contract and led to the Dutch transport firm losing the franchise early.That came after a  winter timetable with the introduction of high-speed trains and new class  electric trains ushered in months of cancellations and disruption to services with much of it put down to staff shortages partly due to training to deal with the new trains and timetable.   "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : amHighlands and Islands Airports Limitedhas published a breakdown of figures relating to its air traffic management strategy .

I’m working on myself, and that’s why I managed to win and still kept my composure, as much as I could, because sometimes I go much more crazier than I did today.“I just felt a little bit not perfect today for a few reasons. First of all, I really don’t know what should I do to play on centre courts in grand slams, because I won the last grand slam. I’m highest seed here and to play against Maxime would be easier on Rod Laver – more space.”Medvedev, who took a medical time-out for treatment to his lower back, was also annoyed that he was not allowed to take a toilet break after the first set without it limiting his chances to change his kit later, and he ended up directing his frustration towards Cressy.“I got, as you can see, pretty mad about it and I think what happened afterwards was a consequence,” said Medvedev. “I’m really sorry to Maxime about it. I was annoyed with the day, let’s call it like this.“I’m not really happy about my mentality today because I was a little bit harsh with Maxime, who played a really good match. At the same time, I’m not the only player to do it, to try to get into my opponent’s head.“And also this can put me off my game, which straight away when I was screaming something or talking about something or not happy with anything, I was trying to completely refocus straight away and try to not think about this when I’m playing.”In the last eight, Medvedev will face ninth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime, who battled past Marin Cilic - -- -to reach the quarter-finals for a third successive slam. vw,vw,px, px\"Felix Auger-Aliassime celebrates reaching the quarter-finals The -year-old joins friend and compatriot Denis Shapovalov, who defeated Alexander Zverev on Sunday, in the last eight.The pair began the season by teaming up to win the ATP Cup for Canada, and Auger-Aliassime said: “I’m just glad that we have been able to be consistent.

Backlogs and waiting lists have grown, essential health services have been disrupted, and plans and preparations for climate-related health stresses and shocks have been put on hold across the region.”Dr Kluge said he did not think any new and emerging iants would require fresh lockdowns.He said: “With strong surveillance and monitoring of new iants, high vaccination uptake and third doses, ventilation, affordable equitable access to antivirals, targeted testing, and shielding high-risk groups with high-quality masks and physical distancingand when a new iant appears, I believe that a new wave could no longer require theto pandemic-era population-wide lockdowns or similar measures.”It comes as a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , Professor Peter Openshaw, said it is not certain the viruses become less severe over time.The professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “The conclusion we have reached after many discussions is that we have no way of concluding that viruses have to become less severe over time.“It could be the next iant – and there will be another – could be more severe for all we know.“There’s no rule about this.”He said reinfections – where somebody tests positive again after a previous bout of Covid – are increasing.“Omicron and sub-lineages of them are able to escape previous immunity so they are going to increase in number over time, and they are dferent and tend to be a bit milder, but that’s not to say they are completely trivial or to be ignored.“We know that vaccination or previous infection will give you immunity or reduce severity. The tendency is for reinfections to be milder, but I think we still have to take this disease very, very seriously.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

Even a knock or a bump could accelerate the transformation of tissue to bone.Lucy explained that when she and her sister were born their toes were shaped like bunions, one of the “tell tale signs” of FOP.However, at the time little was known about the condition, of which there is no definitive treatment or cure available, and the twins were not diagnosed until aged eight.Zoe explained: “When I was five I fell and broke my arm and it never really healed properly. When we were diagnosed with FOP no-one knew much about it because it was so rare.“At the time it was much harder for our parents as they really took the brunt of it because we were children.“But even now it can still be very hard because we are the only people with FOP in Northern Ireland.”Lucy added: “Back when we were children there was hardly any information about FOP but one person we were able to speak to was Fred Kaplan in Philadelphia.“He was the only person who knew much about it and even nowanything goes wrong we can send him an email.“He dedicates a lot of his time to research into FOP and we are very fortunate to have him.”The sisters, who attended Slemish College, described what it was like growing up in Ballymena with FOP.Zoe said: “We are so lucky to have each other but going to school was dficult in the sense that everyone was able bodied and we weren’t.“We went to Slemish which was such a great college, however, I was quite clumsy so I had to use a wheelchair and it was a bit harder for me because I couldn’t go outside at break times and join my friends.”When Lucy was  she tripped and hurt the back of her neck and the resulting bone growth left her unable to raise her arms above her head. In the same year Zoe broke her leg and was left unable to straighten it.Lucy explained that just recently she experienced a flare-up resulting in her jaw locking.She explained: “Over the last six months I have had a couple of flare-ups and it has been really dficult.“I had swelling under my chin and I couldn’t open my mouth so I had to have liquids.“I just kept telling myself that it won’t last and will get better which it did and I am thankful for that because there are people with FOP whose jaws have locked permanently.”Both Lucy and Zoe share a positive outlook on le which comes from practicing gratitude and not worrying about things outside of their control. Zoe who has a keen interest in interior design works for Ivy and Gold and lives in Cloughmills with her husband Mike whilst Lucy, a content creator, lives in Ballymena with her husband Michael.Zoe said: “I couldn’t get a job anywhere. I knew what I was able to do but no-one would take a chance on me. When I got a job with Ivy and Gold I was so grateful.” For Lucy and Zoe the pandemic has been particularly dficult as they are unable to get the vaccine due to their condition.Zoe said: We are normally together all the time but during lockdown we were from dferent households so we couldnt see each other.Butyou needed to be looked after and needed help you were allowed to go to someone s house so I went to my parents. It was hard for me to be on my own.Neither of us can get the vaccine because we cant have anything injected into our muscles so we have to be very careful.The sisters dont know what the future holds for them but they are determined to “live for the now”.Zoe said: “You cant think too far ahead because we dont know what the future holds for us with FOP.“We think it is best to live for the now becauseyou plan ahead too much you are easily disappointed.”Lucy and Zoe are keen to raise awareness of FOP through their social media channels and particularly want to highlight what signs to look out for.Lucy said: A baby with FOP will have toes that look like bunions and some children will have a joint missing in their thumb.“Spotting these first indicators allows parents to find out sooner rather than later whether or not their child has FOP.A petition to dedicate funding into research for the condition was debated in parliament at the end of last year. Lucy said: “Ian Paisley spoke on behalf of us and did such a good job. He fought our corner and we were very appreciative and hopefully it will go through to the next stage.“At the minute FOP families and friends fundraise but it is extremely hard as there are not that many of us.”Last year Zoes husband Mike and his work colleagues from Spar, Doury Road climbed Slemish and raised pound for FOP Friends.They are also planning to organise more fundraising events for the charity which is the only one in the UK dedicated to supporting people living with FOP and their families.The charity actively fundraises to support research into a treatment and a cure for FOP and more information can be found on their website www.fopfriendsYou can also find out more about Lucy and Zoe by following their Instagram handles which are Lucy Fretwell: allthingsbeautullymade and Zoe Buxton: alittlebitofle "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642778651871.jpg--covid_19___fri_21st_january_figures.jpg?1642778651000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220121newscovid 19 fri 21st january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

Ms Armstrong’s bill proposes the setting of minimum targets for the number of children being educated in integrated schools, as well as providing dedicated funding for facilitation of the sector.It aims to reform and meet the growing demand for integrated education, giving it the same support as controlled and maintained schools, allowing for its promotion and provision.It’s a complicated and complex issue, but an issue both the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolsand the Controlled Schools’ Support Councilhave made their positions starkly clear on.For the Alliance MLA, her bill is all about making education better to make society better, but it has left the Assembly and education fractured once again. She has stood up to the expected criticism and worked with amendment after amendment.For some a sht towards integrated education is a huge stride towards constructing a more harmonious future for Northern Ireland. It has big name supporters. Irish President Michael D Higgins is among them. Movie star Liam Neeson has backed schools seeking to secure integrated status, and boxer Carl Frampton is an enthusiastic supporter too.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up But for s of education for the last century, the Catholic Maintained sector and the Controlled sector, there is a corner to be fought for — and both have come out fighting over the last week.Already the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolshas hit back at UUP leader Doug Beattie, saying his use of the phrase “educational apartheid” to describe the current system of education was “ill advised” and “inflammatory”.“The bill makes recommendations for substantial change prioritising support for one sector at a time when an independent review of education is underway which will make recommendations for change in the system as a whole,” the CCMS responded.It added: “The bill’s definition of integration devalues the efforts of Catholic schools who work diligently within communities to encourage dialogue, peace and understanding.”Speaking on behalf of the NI Commission for Catholic Education, Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown has branded it “a very radical and very narrow piece of legislation”. He said the feeling is that Catholic schools are being portrayed as ‘the baddies’ and told to “shut up” in the debate.They are starting to speak now.“Catholic schools contribute positively to the education system through the pursuit of excellence whilst remaining faithful to their distinctive ethos, vision, and approach. The purpose of integrated education proposed in the bill could apply to all Catholic Schools and indeed to schools across all sectors,” said the CCMS.“Regrettably, in its current form the bill prioritises integrated schools above every other school.”And, for once, there is agreement from the other major school sector. The Controlled Schools’ Support Councilisn’t lying down either.“Controlled schools are open to all children and young people,” the CCSC said, pressing the fact that integration is already an integral part of the education system as it is.“The bill uses language that we would contend already applies to all controlled schools and in fact should apply to all grant-aided schools,” it continued.“Controlled schools have been labelled by many as single identity, serving only one side of our community.This is wrong.“The controlled sector is the largest of the education sectors.It accounts for % of all schools and includes  controlled integrated schools and is committed to educating children and young people from all community backgrounds together.”One key issue, and one which has been shared by politicians, is that they believe the bill, as it currently stands, prioritises integrated schools above all others.Ms Armstrong, the bill’s sponsor, is trying to work with all sides of the debate, but every ounce of acceptance is hard won ground.“I have been made out to be the big, bad demon who’s trying to destroy all dferent types of sectors. That is so far from the truth,” she said.“The Education Minister seems to think that I have an issue with the Independent Review of Education.But there is no guarantee that the review will be taken forward after the election.”Having waited so long for support to be offered by Stormont for integrated education, the time for try and grab it and make good the promises of the Good Friday Agreement, was now.Education Minister Michelle McIlveen maintains she supports the education of children together.“What I do not support is poor legislation,” she said.“What I do not support is legislating for one sector at the expense of others, whether intentionally or unintentionally.What I absolutely do not support is playing party politics with the law that will govern our education system.”The amendments to the bill were flying thick and fast throughout last week, every side of the multi-faceted debate trying to shape and mould to their own wishes.What could come out in the end will be a mishmash of ideas, a watered down version of what the supporters of integrated education want.The Education Minister said that there are very serious concerns in terms of how the bill currently before Stormont was drafted.“As introduced, the clauses lack legal clarity. These definitions,not amended, will be open to misinterpretation and therefore result in legal challenge,” said Ms McIlveen.Her DUP colleague Diane Dodds added: “This would create a hierarchy within education where the controlled and maintained sectors would be at the bottom of the pile.”Others appear, on the surface, more flexible to change.Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan saidenacted, the bill “will further enhance the efforts to break down barriers to build a new society rooted in peace and in equality”.There, then, is some qualied support.Daniel McCrossan of the SDLP said his party does not feel the Integrated Education Bill hinders parental choice.“Integrating our children together in education will have massively positive effects for the future of this place,” he said.Ulster Unionist Robbie Butler said his party would like to see a single education system implemented in Northern Ireland and will “work positively with this bill and the amendments to see a bill which is fair and just”.Clare Bailey of the Green Party said: “It’s still shocking in  that we have to declare statements such as ‘of course we want to educate our children together’. It’s , let’s just do it.”People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said he “doesn’t know why religious organisations should have still have such a grip on schools today”.Anyone see the problem Unlike the progress made last week with a bill to introduce a flexible school starting age, the consent across the board is simply not there.Though many say they want change they circle the edge of the future still afraid to take that leap of faith. Integrated education is no easy circle to square, and the edges are sharp.Related topicsDepartment of EducationMichelle McIlveenKellie ArmstrongLiam NeesonPat SheehanSinn FéinSDLPDaniel McCrossanRobbie ButlerGerry CarrollMore On Department of EducationCrisis in our FE colleges ‘fuelling NI’s skills deficit’ PremiumCovid: it isn’t going away you knowNI’s further education colleges see sharp fall in student numbers PremiumStronger messaging urged as NI schools bear the brunt of Covid relaxations PremiumMark BainOpinionLessons to be learned from rare agreement on school starting ageMost ReadTwo men die following crash on Belfast’s Ravenhill RoadBelfast man Jon O’Hara one of two Ravenhill Road crash victims - mancharged with causing death by dangerous drivingAntrim UDA crime boss Andrew Wilson-Smith selling Kinahan cartel cocaineLuxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughEdwin Poots’ we ‘genuinely upset’ over joke posted by UUP leader Doug BeattieTop VideosPlayVideo: Surfer rescues two people after kayak overturns in PortrushPlayVideo - Three police cars damaged as hijacked car collides with church wall in BelfastPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest EducationCrisis in our FE colleges ‘fuelling NI’s skills deficit’NI’s further education colleges see sharp fall in student numbersStronger messaging urged as NI schools bear the brunt of Covid relaxationsMark BainOpinionLessons to be learned from rare agreement on school starting ageSchool Covid absences not as bad as feared, says Education MinisterLatestUK embassy in Argentina to host first ever Burns SupperNearly one in eight schools have high levels of CO according to air monitorsBreak looks to be a welcome one for Everton and owner Farhad MoshiriPrivate sector expertise could help clear up pension mistakes – former ministerLisa Smith trial to begin after court rejects bid to dismiss terror charges,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Imperial War MuseumSimon ToppingJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmail‘Don’t argue religion Don’t argue politics’ was the eminently sensible —belated — counsel in the American Pocket Guide to Northern Ireland.It was sound advice, admittedly offered six months after the first GIs had arrived. American commanders, and ordinary soldiers, understood the delicacy of their new posting, landing in a ided society bordering a neutral state. In some respects Northern Ireland was an odd destination for the first Americans in Europe since the Great War but it made good military and diplomatic sense. Speculation was re that they would cross the border to resist any German invasion of Ireland, and Washington and Londonfelt that American troops would be more welcome than British. The Americans also enabled the British garrison to go to North Africa, while these raw American forces completed their training. The American arrival also implied an early invasion of Europeforcing Hitler to weaken his forces on the Eastern front.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseUS soldiers show local youths how to pay baseball FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueUS soldiers show local youths how to pay baseballDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The GIs disembarked at Belfast’s Dufferin Quayonly seven weeks after Pearl Harbor, but preparations dated back a year. By the summer of  American technicians, ostensibly British employees, were building a naval base at Lisahally outside Londonderry, to protect Atlantic convoys, and other facilities, while in the autumn Churchill suggested to Roosevelt that he send troops to Northern Ireland. Roosevelt, having already stretched the credibility of American neutrality, demurred.The Americans lted the grim wartime mood, arriving less than a year after the devastating Belfast Blitz. Now, for the first time, the war seemed winnable. The welcome was not, however, universal. Nationalist politicians complained that Dublin, despite no jurisdiction, had not been consulted and compared the Americans to the Germans occupying Norway or France, but, more problematically, America had endorsed and legitimised partition. The protests, unpopular in the States, quickly subsided in favour of simply ignoring the Americans. They were briefly resurrected in October when Cardinal Joseph MacRory, the Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, complained about being “overrun”, drawing condemnation in America and little support in Ireland. Nevertheless, despite these protests, the US consulate in Belfast believed that the Americans “were received just as heartily by nationalist groups” as by unionists, a view echoed by the Ministry of Information. The IRA, after failed campaigns south of the border and in England, linked a new campaign in Northern Ireland to Americans, a link the unionist press was happy to publicise.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSimon Topping#s book, Northern Ireland, The United States and the Second World War FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSimon Topping#s book, Northern Ireland, The United States and the Second World WarThe group never actively targeted Americans, beyond some beatings in the blackout, but the perceived threat created considerable anxiety at the consulate.Managing the , Americans who passed through fell to Sir Basil Brooke, the Minister of Commerce and Prime Minister from May . Brooke was the most dynamic minister of a government heavily criticised for its handling of the war, but he did an excellent job, setting up  hospitality committees by D-Day. These volunteer groups, almost iniably run by unionists, organised events, outings and dances to keep Americans away from the ‘pub and the pick-up’. The American Red Cross arrived in February  taking over the Plaza in Belfast’s Chichester Street, and many other venues, including the Ormeau baths, to look after the GIs off-duty. Numerous celebrities dropped in, including Bob Hope, Merle Oberon, and Al Jolson with Glenn Miller and his orchestra coming in August  , while First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt made a flying visit in November .The Americans brought their sports and their music. To mark the Fourth of July  Windsor Park hosted a baseball game between the ‘Kentucky Wildcats’ and the ‘Mid-West Giants’. To celebrate Thanksgiving, American football or ‘gridiron’ was played at Ravenhill between ‘Hale’ and ‘Yard’before , spectators. The Belfastdeclared the game not simply “a test of brute strength” but “a highly technical business”. Many Americans, including Lockheed technicians from the Langford Lodge air base near Lough Neagh, formed swing bands to accommodate the ‘jitterbug fever’ which swept the land. More unusually, US Marines in Londonderry formed a highland band, complete with bagpipes but drawing the line at kilts, but they did claim third place in the Dromora contest of .To many, the Americans, in their immaculate unorms, Hollywood accents and confident demeanour, seemed to have stepped off the silver screen. One group, however, had an added exotic appeal. Most locals had never seen a black person before, generating considerable curiosity about these particular newcomers. Thedeclared that these “dusky doughboys have been winning all hearts by their cheery ways”, and, although patronising to modern eyes, this coverage was very well-intentioned. Generally African American GIs and the population reacted positively to each other the troops appreciated no formal segregation and being made welcome by a white population. One wrote “the Irish treat us aswe were one of them”, and that they “never hear of discrimination and stuff like that”. Indeed, trouble was caused by white Americans imposing ‘Jim Crow’ segregation, especially resentful that local girls danced with and dated their black comrades whites also threatened to lynch African American veterans in America after the war.The truism that the Americans were ‘overpaid, oversexed and over here’ certainly applied to Northern Ireland. The sentimental ‘Johnny Doughboy found a Rose in Ireland’ was a big hit for Kay Keyser in , and love blossomed with , local women marrying Yanks. Couples had to overcome numerous hurdles, as military bureaucracy, local hostility, religious conservatism and sudden deployment, all delayed weddings. All of this safely negotiated, wives, and often children, still had to get to the States, but so frustrated were war brides that  occupied the consulate in January  demanding transport. The consul cancelled non-urgent business and secured ships for most of the brides that spring.There was a darker side to the Americans as, along with gum, nylons and jitterbugging, they brought crime, racism and drunkenness. Drunken Americans killed five civilians while a bus driver in Dungiven was shot when his vehicle accidentally joined a convoy carrying General George C. Marshall. The soldier responsible was, however, exonerated. The  Visiting Forces Act ceded criminal jurisdiction to the American military, meaning trials by courts martial, including for crimes against civilians.Fears that the US military would be lenient proved largely unfounded, as military justice was often harsh, both to maintain discipline and good relations with civilians.Alcohol was central to bad behaviour. The Guide warned against whiskey and especially poteen , warnings regularly unheeded. Women reported being constantly harassed, some carrying pepper pots and whistles for protection, or being reluctant to go out alone, with one woman stating: “It was by no means safe to be out in the darkness while they were around.”The physical remnants of the American presence are scattered throughout Northern Ireland, from the rusting and decaying skeletons of old bases and installations, to the memorials at Lisnabreeny, and, most prominently, the unpretentious column at Belfast City Hall.The psychological impact of the American presence is harder to determine. The war was undoubtedly transformative for Northern Ireland. Experiences such as the Blitz, rationing, hardships and casualty lists, along with hosting Americans, drew Northern Ireland closer to the rest of the UK and made it arguably more ‘British’ than ever. Equally, Éire’s neutrality hardened the border and thus the isions between the two states, making ending partition even more remote. The war and the Americans did not, moreover, ease internal sectarian dynamics, as nationalist hostility to the state and unionist domination remained thoroughly entrenched.By early  there were , GIs in Northern Ireland, but by July almost all had departed for France. The American presence formally ended a year later with theof Langford Lodge’s keys, but it really concluded in August , just as the Japanese surrendered, with the visit of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. In January  Eisenhower had privately declared: “We’re going to regret every damn boat we sent to Ireland”, but now his praise was fulsome. Greeted by tens of thousands of well-wishers and an improvised ticker-tape parade in Belfast, he accepted the freedom of the city and an honorary Doctor of Laws from Queen’s. At Stormont he declared that “without Northern Ireland I do not see how the American Forces could have been concentrated to begin the invasion of Europe”. Eisenhower’s eulogy proved a fitting testament to Northern Ireland’s hosting of the Americans and the closing of an important and positive chapter in its history.Simon Topping is Associate Professor of United States History at the University of Plymouth and author of Northern Ireland, the United States and the Second World War Related topicsIRAMore On IRASinn Fein face writ over Jean McConville murder PremiumSam McBrideOpinionSecrecy and power: What Sue Gray’s two NI sojourns reveal about her PremiumJason BurkeOpinionAttacks on Catholics just one part of the ‘Belfast pogrom’ story PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionGalliagh security alert: Regardless of who was responsible, frustration and disruption remains Premium years on and some relatives still can’t bear to visit scene of Teebane bombingMost ReadTwo men die following crash on Belfast’s Ravenhill RoadBelfast man Jon O’Hara one of two Ravenhill Road crash victims - mancharged with causing death by dangerous drivingAntrim UDA crime boss Andrew Wilson-Smith selling Kinahan cartel cocaineLuxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughEdwin Poots’ we ‘genuinely upset’ over joke posted by UUP leader Doug BeattieTop VideosPlayVideo: Surfer rescues two people after kayak overturns in PortrushPlayVideo - Three police cars damaged as hijacked car collides with church wall in BelfastPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandOmicron leading to more hospitalisations among children in Northern Ireland ‘but number remains low’, says QUB professorMan charged with causing death by dangerous driving after fatal Belfast crashStuart McKinleyOpinionMatthew Tipton’s popularity was no use to him in a results businessDavid Jeffrey slams ‘lack of ambition’ claims as he fights to keep captain Leroy MillarChristy Manzinga driven on by desire to show Linfield what they were missing last seasonLatestUK embassy in Argentina to host first ever Burns SupperNearly one in eight schools have high levels of CO according to air monitorsBreak looks to be a welcome one for Everton and owner Farhad MoshiriPrivate sector expertise could help clear up pension mistakes – former ministerLisa Smith trial to begin after court rejects bid to dismiss terror charges,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I looked at my qualications and thought now was the time to do something with them,” he said, speaking from a coffee shop in China.Patrick then ed to his studies, gaining a PGCE teaching qualication in England before coming back to Northern Ireland in the hopes of helping people as a teacher.He soon cast his career net further and after looking originally to move to Dubai, he settled on China — even though he had never visited the country before.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “China is the opposite of the end of the world, and after I put my CV online, I started to get some emails about maybe going there to work and just decided to bite the bullet,” he said.Once settled, he began his role as International School Principal in Changshu, near Shanghai, where he teaches English to kindergarten children.He was living in China as the Covid- pandemic took hold nearly two years ago and said the country took big steps to manage the crisis early on.Patrick is adamant China is a fantastic place to work and live, adding: “If given the opportunity to come here, people would be crazy not to take it.I don’t know why I didn’t do it sooner.”“I feel super safe here, it’s so under control,there are just two cases they act quickly with testing, and it means our case count is so low.“I look at the news in Belfast and sometimes compare the numbers to the thousands a week sometimes in Northern Ireland.”It was recently reported that the port city of Tianjin near Beijing had begun testing its entire population of  million after just  people tested positive for Covid —  with at least two cases  believed to be the Omicron iant.“I can see why China takes  it so seriously though, and whilst it may look a bit extreme sometimes, their reputation already was damaged from it, so they have to act like this,” added Patrick.He says he  has been saddened by a rise in anti-Asian and racist comments directed towards Chinese people across the world, widely believed to be linked to the pandemic.Covid restrictions permitting, outside of his working le, Patrick says he enjoys China’s lestyle and is looking forward to celebrating a low key Chinese New Year on February .“China is like an attack on the senses, everyone acts so dferently to Belfast but everyone is so nice,” he added.“They’re a bit obsessed with foreigners, so I always get people coming up to me wanting to talk, some people even want your telephone number.”Most ReadTwo men die following crash on Belfast’s Ravenhill RoadBelfast man Jon O’Hara one of two Ravenhill Road crash victims - mancharged with causing death by dangerous drivingAntrim UDA crime boss Andrew Wilson-Smith selling Kinahan cartel cocaineLuxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughEdwin Poots’ we ‘genuinely upset’ over joke posted by UUP leader Doug BeattieTop VideosPlayVideo: Surfer rescues two people after kayak overturns in PortrushPlayVideo - Three police cars damaged as hijacked car collides with church wall in BelfastPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest WorldFrance bars unvaccinated from restaurants and sports venuesNato sends ships and fighter jets to eastern Europe amid Russia-Ukraine tensionsPresident of Burkina Faso ‘held by mutinous soldiers’Pakistan launches polio vaccination drive amid coronavirus surgeJapan continues aid deliveries to tsunami-ravaged TongaLatestPrivate sector expertise could help clear up pension mistakes – former ministerLisa Smith trial to begin after court rejects bid to dismiss terror chargesFinancial Conduct Authority staff to vote on strike action over pay changesGardai investigate alleged sex attacks on teenage girlsMinister defends national insurance hike as Tory calls grow for it to be scrapped,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

took over control of Afghanistan in August.The closed-door meetings were taking place at a hotel in the snow-capped mountains above the Norwegian capital Oslo.Taliban representatives will be certain to press their demand that nearly  billion dollarsfrozen by the United States and other Western countries be released as Afghanistan faces a precarious humanitarian situation.“We are requesting them to unfreeze Afghan assets and not punish ordinary Afghans because of the political discourse,” said Taliban delegate Shafiullah Azam on Sunday night.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news

of the starvation, because of the deadly winter, I think it’s time for the international community to support Afghans, not punish them because of their political disputes.”Ahead of the talks, Western diplomats met with Afghan women’s rights activists and human rights defenders to hear from civil society in Afghanistan and the Afghan diaspora about their demands and assessment of the current

lives in Kabul, held up the photos of Tamana Zaryabi Paryani and Parwana Ibrahimkhel, two women arrested by the Taliban last week following an anti-Taliban protest against the compulsory Islamic headscarf, or hijab, for women.They have not been seen since.Rejecting the accusation the Taliban had abducted them, Azam said he was “not aware of that” and suggested activists may be using this event to seek asylum.Speaking after the meeting, women’s rights activist Mahbouba Seraj angrily rejected this and warned that “ they continue this way – to tell us something and do something  – that’s when the trust is going to break, completely”.The three-day talks opened on Sunday with direct meetings between the Taliban and civil society representatives.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph

all the problems of Afghanistan”, and emphasised that “all Afghans need to work together for better political, economic and security outcomes in the country”.Ms Seraj acknowledged the progress made.“Yes, they were listening. I should say that,” she said on Monday morning.“We gave them a paper. We asked them what we wanted. They took it. They were very, very cordial about it.”The talks come at a crucial time for Afghanistan as freezing temperatures are compounding misery from the downward spiral that has come with the fall of the US-backed government and the Taliban takeover.Aid groups and international agencies estimate about  million people, more than half the country, face severe hunger and nearly nine million are on the brink of starvation.People have resorted to selling possessions to buy food, burning furniture for warmth and even selling their children.The United Nations has managed to provide some liquidity and allowed the Taliban administration to pay for imports, including electricity.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news dfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffd-b-a--ece_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news dfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffd-b-a--ece_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news dfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffd-b-a--ece_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news dfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffd-b-a--ece_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Taliban delegate Shafiullah Azam, right, talks to a delegate at a hotel in Oslo AP PA Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueTaliban delegate Shafiullah Azam, right, talks to a delegate at a hotel in Oslo Faced with the Taliban’s request for funds, Western powers are likely to put the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan high on their agenda, along with the West’s recurring demand for the Taliban administration to share power with Afghanistan’s minority ethnic and religious groups.Since sweeping to power in mid-August, the Taliban have imposed widespread restrictions, many of them directed at women.Women have been banned from many jobs outside the health and education fields, their access to education has been restricted beyond sixth grade and they have been ordered to wear the hijab.The Taliban have, however, stopped short of imposing the burka, which was compulsory when they previously ruled Afghanistan in the s.The Taliban have increasingly targeted Afghanistan’s beleaguered rights groups, as well as journalists, detaining and sometimes beating television crews covering demonstrations.A US delegation, led by special representative for Afghanistan Tom West, plans to discuss “the formation of a representative political system responses to the urgent humanitarian and economic crises security and counterterrorism concerns and human rights, especially education for girls and women”, according to a statement released by the US State Department.Norway, home to the Nobel Peace Prize, is no stranger to diplomacy.It has been involved in peace efforts in a number of countries, including Mozambique, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Colombia, the Philippines, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, Syria, Myanmar, Somalia, Sri Lanka and South Sudan.Most ReadTwo men die following crash on Belfast’s Ravenhill RoadBelfast man Jon O’Hara one of two Ravenhill Road crash victims -

is expected to start shortly on a major internal upgrade at Ballynahinch Community Centre.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has drawn up plans to reconfigure the internal layout of the Windmill Street facility as part of a signicant investment initiative.Local people are being asked for their views on the planned upgrade which could be completed as early as the summer and cost in the region of pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that everything is now on track.In addition to the planned work at the community centre, consideration is also being given to investing around pound, to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.And the Recorder understands that consideration is being given to providing an ultra-modern G sports pitch at the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgradeA number of politicians have been lobbying for the local authority to address what they described as the organisationrsquos ldquounder investment in Ballynahinch and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of its future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community

with the Community Foundation to award grants of up pound, to groups and organisations in rural locations over the next year to help them access digital technology and purchase equipment.The fund has a particular focus on supporting grassroots organisations that support older people and young people aged  and under.It has been confirmed that the community fund will operate in four phases in tandem

Fund applications for these areas is now open.Mr Nicholas McCrickard mdash manager of the Co Down Rural Community Network mdash said the organisation very much welcomes the launch of the fund.ldquoAccess to the world of digital services is no longer a luxury, he continued. ldquoIt is becoming a necessity and people in rural areas are particularly vulnerable and with the ongoing closure of banks and other rural services, people very often have no option but to use digital devices.ldquoWe hope local groups in the Down area will make applications on behalf of older and younger people. We urge groups to think about how they can help rural residents and the Network is available to help with applicationsrequired.Community fund development manager Marcus Cooper highlighted the importance of keeping rural communities connected.ldquoCoronavirus has highlighted the need for communities to remain connected and many groups and charities working with those most vulnerable in our communities are telling us that a strong and sustainable broadband connection in rural communities is vitally important, he continued.ldquoThe pandemic has massively increased our use of technology and it now plays a vital role in our daily lives.

And as well as their cultural signicance the implications for the economic and tourism attraction of the historic centre of the county are obvious.They add: ldquoWe call on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to halt its current direction of travel and demonstrate a commitment to restoring what was an internationally recognised centre of excellence in Downpatrick.ldquoWe ask it to respect its moral responsibility to honour the trust placed in the museum by those thousands of donors and friends who expected the council to cherish and support this public treasure house of the shared histories of County Down.Last week a spokesperson for the council said it was ldquocommitted to the continuous improvement and development of its museums.The spokesperson also said a meeting was held in December with stakeholders and elected representatives to clary there would be a reduction in ldquostaff head count following the restructuring.ldquoFurther engagement with stakeholders is planned for early this year and we look forward to working with all our partners to advance the councilrsquos ambitious and exciting plans for our museum services, the spokesperson added.See Letters on pages  and ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"Down go under against Antrim  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo disappointing start to their Dr McKenna Cup campaign continued when they lost out to Antrim by two points in Newry last week.The defeat means back-to-back losses for James McCartanrsquos new-look side, despite some encouraging inidual performances throughout from the Mourne outfit.Down will count themselves unlucky not to gain anything from the contest, having gone tit for tat with the Saffrons in the first half and Barry OrsquoHagan seeing his last gasp goal bound effort ricocheting over the bar instead of hitting the back of the net.McCartanrsquos men got off to a dream start when the newly ed Niall McParland sent a long ball forward into the hands of Ryan OrsquoHiggins, who opened the scoring through a well struck goal just three minutes in.Ruairi McCann and Odhran Eastwood confidently kicked over frees to bring Antrim within one point of levelling the scores before Packie OrsquoHagan doubled Downrsquos lead just before the  minute mark.Antrim did manage to completely reduce the deficit before the first water-break, with two quick-fire scores coming from Patrick McBride and a Pat Shivers free.As the players rehydrated, the surrounding supporters at Pairc Esler were awarded time to catch their breath as the fast paced game was momentarily brought to a halt.Veteran Darren OrsquoHagan entered the fray in the place of John McGeough upon the resumption before James Laverty kicked over a point from play to give the visitors the lead for the first time in the match.A well worked attack ended with Kevin McKernan levelling proceedings once again for the hosts, and soon after captain Caolan Mooney fired over between the sticks to give his side the advantage.Things began heating up in the cold weather, with plenty of firm challenges on show.Anytime the Mourne side were edging ahead, Antrim were right on their coattails and were now starting to overpower the home side in dferent areas of the pitch.Antrimrsquos McCann kicked over two unanswered points, the first from a rsquorsquo and the second from a free, although Downrsquos sharpshooting Barry OrsquoHagan restored parity in a matter of seconds.With three minutes to the interval, McCann converted his fourth free of the night to give the Saffrons a one point lead.Half time: Down - Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

It was revealed last May that one driver was clocked travelling at an incredible mph in the mph zone in Saintfield at am.Figures released by the PCSP over the past year have revealed that speeding in built-up areas across the district continues to be a major problem.In addition to the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield, other speeding hot spots include the Strangford Road in Downpatrick and South Promenade in Newcastle.The Dundrum Road in Clough is a new entry on the list following the installation of an electronic speeding device on the approach to the village, while the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass is another new entry on the speeding hot-spot list.The highest speed recorded in the mph zone in Clough was mph at am, with the highest speed at the Strangford Road mdash where a mph limit is in place mdash was mph. This offence was detected around am.Since the speeds recorded by the electronic devices have been made public, politicians have expressed their shock at the behaviour of those who continue to break the law and have appealed to them to slow down.Erected as part of a major offensive on speeding drivers at a number of well known speeding hot spots, the speed indicator devices are being hailed a success as speeds in most areas where they are located are reducing.However, concern remains about the behaviour of some drivers continuing to show a blatant disregard for mph and mph speed limits in place.Recent figures published by the PCSP revealed that the highest number of speeders in Castlewellan and Killyleagh were detected around am and pm respectively, with those who hit high speeds in Ardglass detected at pm.While Clough recorded the highest speed, a detailed examination of the figures reveals that five drivers went through the mph in the village at mph, with % of all drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit.In Downpatrick,  drivers were detected at over mph in the mph zone, with one driver clocked at mph in the mph zone at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan. The highest speed recorded at the mph zone at the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass was mph.Policing and Community Safety Partnership officials say that figures recorded across the districtrsquos speed indicator signs for the most recent three-month period shows an overall speed reduction of around six percent.The number of drivers clocked at over mph across the  speed indicator signs spread across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area was almost , while the average number of speeding violations over mph was %. The average number of speeding violations over mph in mph zones was almost %..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13398148.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In addition, the superb acting, compelling plot and high production values show that when the BBC trusts writers, directors, producers ahead of box-ticking bureaucrats the corporation can still make brilliant TV drama.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Watching week by week rather than bingeing on ‘The Tourist’ it struck me that this single series underlines the importance of the BBC in the nation’s social and cultural le.At a time when the Beeb has come under fire from a government desperate to ert public attention away from the Downing Street ‘partygate’ scandals it is worth reminding readers why the BBC is still worth defending. And for the readership of this newspaper why the corporation remains a plus factor for those arguing in favour of the Union.Nadine Dorries, the Cultural Secretary has frozen the licence fee and warned that the days of pensioners being pursued through the courts because they can’t afford to pay the BBC ‘tax’ are over. Many and not only unionists in the UK might agree with that viewpoint. The BBC’s critics here and across the water can also find many faults with its output.Some of its TV drama seems based on a writing-by-numbers formula designed to be PC and woke. Part of its international news outfits especially its Arabic service have been found guilty at times of blatant bias against only Israel in the Middle East conflict.The Jewish Chronicle has recently focussed on two examples of its news and current affairs section playing down Islamic anti-Semitism.In an anti-Semitic incident against Jewish students in London’s Oxford Circus the BBC coverage accused the victims of uttering an anti-Muslim remark, which an independent voice analyst expert has said there was absolutely no evidence of the young Jews saying this.In the recent attempt by a lone Blackburn born Islamist to kidnap and threaten to kill Jews at a Texas synagogue the Chronicle pointed out that in a BBC report on the stand-off there was no mention whatsoever about anti-Semitism as a motive. This was even though the gunman ranted about “F****** Jews” in his final call to his family before the FBI shot him dead.Having worked in the BBC I have to stress however that the vast majority of staff journalists both here and over there behave with impeccable neutrality. For instance, it is worth noting the treatment meted out to Stephen Nolan and his team on social media by trolls. One day he and his colleagues are damned for being anti-loyalist and pro-republican while the next it’s the other way around. Shot on Twitter and Facebook by both sides, which in effect means you must be doing something right journalisticallyyou are attacked on each front. More reason to stand up for Nolan and his programme makers after a wave of torrid abuse in recent years.My partner works a large chunk of the year in the United States. One of her cultural lelines back to the UK remains the BBC. Radio ’seclectic, educational sometimes eccentric programmes are unique and yes, very British. They make her feel proud to be part of these islands northwest off the European Continent.Britain may no longer be epitomised by Orwell’s old maids biking through morning mists to communion. Instead, today’s multi-cultural UK is exemplied for instance by the Glaswegian based outstanding radio comedy set in an Asian family’s shop, ‘Fags, Mags and Bags’. ‘The Archers’ meanwhile remains a constant in my le like millions of others ever since a roommate of mine from Devon introduced me to Ambridge when we were at Edinburgh University in the early s.‘Test Match Special’ and Five Live’s football coverage on Saturday noon along with Radio Ulster’s superb ‘Sports Sound” provide some of the most intelligent, iconoclastic, and sometimes absurdly funnysports journalism in the world.Think too about when the UK is plunged into national crises such as Covid and who the British public goes to for its trusted source of information. A corporation whose news coverage can rely on the wisdom and experience of someone like John Simpson to explain an ever increasingly darkening, complex world or Hugh Pym and Fergus Walsh’s lucid guidance for viewers through the pandemic years are yet more reasons to protect the BBC.It may not be as beloved by the nation as the NHS but the BBC remains like the health service one of those uniquely British institutions which the UK would be all the poorerit was no longer there. Unionists should therefore regard the corporation as a cultural asset in their campaign to preserve something even bigger than the Beeb — the Union itself.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I just mentioned I was fond of a cream bun on air one day and it just stuck.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I could have the weight of the world on my shoulders before my show - I’m not always chirpy, chirpy, chirpy all the time, but as soon as I am on air I forget about all my worries and am just in that moment of communication with my listeners.Hugo on his wedding day with Joan in . The couple have one daughter and four grandchildren“The same with anytime I go out on stage and pick up a microphone to sing. Those moments are magical to me.”The wee man from Strabane certainly has musical kudos.In the early s, he was spotted on a TV talent show on RTE and signed by the then fledgling Release Records, which later spawned such stars as Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam and Eurovision star Jonny Logan.By the time he was , he had formed his own band, Hugo Duncan and the Tall Men, and had a number one hit in the Irish charts with Dear God.Hugo and his only daughter Suzanne. The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county. And I just love getting out and singing and performing with a band because the buzz you get from doing what you do on stage is second to none.Listen to Hugo Duncan on BBC Radio Ulster, Wednesdays, from .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"watch the reaction of some of the first people to see belfast film on official uk release date ","story":"Higgins in spotlight over political neutrality ahead of major Bloody Sunday event following ‘sectarian NI state’ comments from organisers   DUP saysgovernment will axe double-jobbing due to lack of support in NI then why won’t it axe the Irish Sea border NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleWatch the reaction of some of the first people to see Belfast film on official UK release dateThe News Letter spoke to some of the first members of the public in Northern Ireland to see Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast film on its official release date today.By Graeme CousinsFriday, st January , : pm  \"       \"  It got a resounding thumbs up from people who’d viewed it and those who hadn’t seen it yet were keen to do so as soon as possible.At the Odeon cinema in Belfast’s Victoria Square, the News Letter learnt that as of lunchtime today  people were booked for the .pm screening and a further  for the .pm showing, with even more expected tomorrow and Sunday.

Empire’s Ian Greer, who gave the movie four out of five, writes: “Belfast doesn’t tell a linear yarn instead, it’s an assemblage of anecdotes and moments that will charm and spark with wherever and whenever you grew up.“The Troubles serves as an undercurrent rather than a leading player, making Belfast much more of a memory movie than a political diatribe.”Robbie Collin, chief film critic at Thegave the film three out of five.He said: “This autobiographical period piece is oddly impersonal, but the cast, and one marvellous scene in a social club, make it worth catching.”Based on , reviews to date, the Internet Movie Databaserating for Belfast is . out of .——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast year because we were in deep lockdown it never happened and because of the current Covid rules it had to be postponed again, which is probably why only three walkers came out to meet him at the Knap car terrace in perfect walking weather, on a bright and crisp morning to join in a -mile replacement walk.On the hillside just above them are the neat foundations of a Roman Building which contained  rooms all grouped around a courtyard with the building being dated to the late rd century AD by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust. It seems a natural harbour was to be found to the east of this area and one theory is that this was a guesthouse connected with naval activity at the harbour as no evidence of a water supply or baths common in villa’s could be found. In the early ’s the trust carried out excavations on site and pieces of Roman pottery and tiles were found and a public viewing  now overlooks the site.They soon warmed up due to a short but stf climb onto the clftop and followed a narrow path through woodland to descend the Golden Stairs into Porthkerry Country Park, where the frost covered board walk led them towards the ft Porthkerry Viaduct. Deviating off the cycle path at Robin’s Walk brought them into muddy fields beside the Whitelands Brook for the climb up to join the A opposite Welford and along the verge to cross a stile leading into fields behind Blackton Farm.A well-worn farm track led to the road for the journey to Penmark Village where they entered the churchyard of St Mary’s for their mid-morning refreshments, utilising the steps on the preaching cross as seating whilst enjoying the warm sunshine. The church dates to the th century being mentioned for the first time in  and a few centuries later the tower was added, but most of its medieval traits were lost when it was renovated during the Victorian era..removeThey continued and joined part of the long distance Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail, through fields on the boundary of Cardf Airport making towards Fonmon with its lovely duck pond and stunning weeping willow tree which cascades over the water. Then climbing steps into a small wood leading to muddy fields near Home Farm they eventually exited onto Port Road following it southwards to East Aberthaw.Taking time out they paused at the Blue Anchor for a swt pint outside in the fresh air before following Well Road downhill. This road was previously known as Marshe Way, one would presume because the River Thaw flowed to reach the sea by this route until the Aberthaw Power Station was built and the river was re-routed.Tramping muddy paths below the main Vale railway line through the nature reserve which is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest, they headed through the reed beds beside the western end of the delightful lake, overseen by the ruined Aberthaw Limeworks built in , to arrive at the sea defence wall. Heading out onto the beach they found a suitable place for lunch sitting on a washed up tree trunk beside the dunes and overlooking the Bristol Channel and English coastline before continuing along the salt flats.The beautul refurbished clf steps on part of the Wales Coast Path brought them steeply uphill into Fontygary Leisure Park, which was eerily quiet due to the winter months and reaching Fontygary beach, they continued up steps following the coast path past the old disused limestone quarries to reach the southernmost tip of mainland Wales and Rhoose Point. Onward through Porthkerry Holiday Park and the Iron Age hillfort at the Bulwarks, to slither downhill through the woods back into Porthkerry for the steep climb back up the Golden Stairs in order to make their way along the clftop to Cold Knap, just as the sun was sinking in the western sky.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Backlogs and waiting lists have grown, essential health services have been disrupted, and plans and preparations for climate-related health stresses and shocks have been put on hold across the region.”Dr Kluge said he did not think any new and emerging iants would require fresh lockdowns.He said: “With strong surveillance and monitoring of new iants, high vaccination uptake and third doses, ventilation, affordable equitable access to antivirals, targeted testing, and shielding high-risk groups with high-quality masks and physical distancingand when a new iant appears, I believe that a new wave could no longer require theto pandemic-era population-wide lockdowns or similar measures.”It comes as a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , Professor Peter Openshaw, said it is not certain the viruses become less severe over time.The professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “The conclusion we have reached after many discussions is that we have no way of concluding that viruses have to become less severe over time.“It could be the next iant – and there will be another – could be more severe for all we know.“There’s no rule about this.”He said reinfections – where somebody tests positive again after a previous bout of Covid – are increasing.“Omicron and sub-lineages of them are able to escape previous immunity so they are going to increase in number over time, and they are dferent and tend to be a bit milder, but that’s not to say they are completely trivial or to be ignored.“We know that vaccination or previous infection will give you immunity or reduce severity.

Creative iniduals in Northern Ireland are calling on the Government to take action.These iniduals face a financial emergency furthering the challenges faced over the past two years. In discussions with those affected, one inidual told Free The Night he now faces the very real and distressing possibility of having to sell his home.Holly Lester , said: “We are extremely disappointed with the Government’s lack of engagement on this issue, which is affecting many iniduals from our creative night time sector. “A full Covid recovery plan and support for the previous lockdown must be discussed immediately. It is critical that action is taken before the government breaks for the election at the end of March.”Robbie Nelson DJ , explained: “I remember a time when I could play four gigs in one night. I have only played four in the last two years. “Everything  I had booked in was cancelled due to the uncertainty and no one was willing to take the risk with the possibility that things might be closed at the last minute.“We got the biggest and worst shock of all when, without warning, on December , my right to earn money was stopped with no financial backing. I have put my whole le into music and it is really sad that my le’s work has just been switched off.”Free The Night and creative iniduals are now asking those who also work within the sector - including but not limited to venue owners, promoters, DJs, taxi drivers, security workers, AV technicians, hospitality workers - and those who use the night time economy - pub goers, club goers, theatre goers, evening workers, and many more - to use their voice and write to their MLAs to highlight the issue.----Read More Read MoreNew street lighting for Carrickfergus includes vandalism-hit town centre areasGovernmentAntrimEast Antrim  \"       \"  ]]Most Popular‘Substantial’ sum of money found in Portadown...NewsWitnesses sought after car hits tree in M crash...NewsMan sent messages of sexual nature to girl...NewsMaghera family raise a total of £, for health care facil...NewsBallymoney traffic disruption as police revisit scene of fat...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":"historian looks back at the industrial heritage of coalisland weaving company ","story":"Manwho was in in possession of heroin receives suspended jail sentence   ‘Substantial’ sum of money found in PortadownNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleHIstorian looks back at the industrial heritage of Coalisland Weaving CompanyA brilliant new book by Sammy McKay, the popular Coalisland historian, called “Light of Other Days Around Coalisland – Stories of Coal, Cotton, Clay, Canals, Steam and Iron” has just been released as part of the Coalisland  East Tyrone – Great Place Scheme.By Stanley CampbellMonday, th January , : amUpdated Monday, th January , : am  \"       \"  Sammy, who recently celebrated his  th birthday, started taking an interest in the industrial heritage of his hometown  years ago and this is the first time his remarkableresearch has been available as a book. “Light of Other Days…” begins with a fascinating account of the Coalisland Weaving Company, where Sammy worked as production manager until it closed.The old factory, now a museum, was once the biggest employer in the town and this opening chapter will be of huge interest to many families who have relatives that used to work there.Local historian Sammy McKay.The book continues with a series of interviews from the s in which Sammy gathered the reminiscences of hard working people who were born when mines, factories, mills, canals and the railways dominated the industrial landscape of East Tyrone. In turn, these industries were also shaping the character and resilience of the people. Sadly, the friendsand neighbours who Sammy interviewed have now all passed away.However, their personal accounts reveal the powerful influence that this homeplace had on those local people. Without his judicious foresight, those memories would have been lost forever. Sammy’s work was previously available as a series of pamphlets which were held by Coalisland Library. This book brings them together into a single volume and deservedlypresents them as a valuable historical resource, a book that will be treasured by readers today and in the future.The book has been published by Lough Neagh Partnership as part of the Coalisland  East Tyrone – Great Place Scheme through the Ulster Historical Foundation with funding from National Lottery Heritage Fund and additional support from Mid Ulster District Council.There is no charge for the book and it will be available FREE at outlets in Coalisland.
