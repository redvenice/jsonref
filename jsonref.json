The stark reality is that today this virulent new strain of the virus is very much on the rise and we need to act now to prevent a crisis that will unleash even more pain and anguish.\u0027A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the Government would \u0027not hesitate to take actions necessary to protect local communities\u0027.England is edging closer towards a blanket shutdown after government efforts to reopen schools were thrown into disarray by Left-wing councils and teaching unions. Gavin Williamson confirmed on Friday that all London primary schools will remain shut to most pupils next week - rather than just those in certain boroughs as set out earlier in the week - but teaching unions say all schools should close for the next two weeks.Last night, the Department for Education said remote learning was \u0027a last resort\u0027 and classrooms should reopen \u0027wherever possible\u0027 with appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission.\u0027As we\u0027ve said, we will move to remote education as a last resort, with involvement of public health officials, in areas where infection and pressures on the NHS are highest,\u0027 the spokesperson said.Hundreds of new vaccination sites are due to be up and running this week as the NHS ramps up its immunisation programme with the newly approved Oxford University and AstraZeneca jab. Some 530,000 doses of the vaccine will be available for rollout across the UK from Monday and more than a million patients have already had their first dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine which was the first to be approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. But Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said children\u0027s education cannot be \u0027furloughed\u0027 for months while vaccinations are rolled out and time absent from the classroom should be kept to an \u0027absolute minimum\u0027, the Sunday Telegraph reported.Children\u0027s Commissioner Anne Longfield told the newspaper that schools should be the last to close and first to open, when safe to do so, adding: \u0027I hope, for children and parents\u0027 sake, that is measured in days not weeks and I would be particularly keen for primaries to stay open if at all possible.\u0027 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the vaccine roll-out was \u0027our great hope\u0027, adding: \u0027I want the Government to throw everything it can at this, harnessing the extraordinary talents of our NHS so we can be vaccinating at least two million Brits a week by the end of the month.\u0027  But, writing in the Sunday Mirror, he criticised \u0027a chaotic last minute U-turn on schools\u0027, adding: \u0027Confusion reigns among parents, teachers and pupils over who will be back in school tomorrow and who won\u0027t.\u0027General secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), Mary Bousted, said schools should stay closed for two weeks to \u0027break the chain\u0027 of transmission and prevent the NHS becoming overwhelmed.\u0027The union, which represents the majority of teachers, has advised its members it is not safe to return to classrooms on Monday.NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman said the union had started preliminary steps in legal proceedings against the Department for Education, asking it to share its scientific data about safety and transmission rates.Unions have also called for the reopening of schools in Wales next week to be delayed with Laura Doel, director of school leaders\u0027 union NAHT Cymru, saying \u0027the latest data shows that in large parts of Wales, control of infection has been lost\u0027.From January 4, all London primary schools will be required to provide remote learning for two weeks to all children except vulnerable children and those of key workers, who will be allowed to attend.Mr Williamson said the January 1 decision to expand closures to the nine remaining London boroughs and the City of London was a \u0027last resort\u0027.Under the Government\u0027s initial plan, secondary schools and colleges were set to be closed to most pupils for the first two weeks of January, while primary schools within 50 local authorities in the south of England, including 23 London boroughs, were also told to keep their doors shut until January 18.Green Party-led Brighton and Hove City Council has advised primary schools in the Tier 4 area not to return in person, except for vulnerable children and those of key workers, until January 18 despite the Government\u0027s plan for most schools to open in person. Linda Bauld, a professor in public health at the University of Edinburgh, said transmission among primary school pupils was \u0027still very limited\u0027 while secondary school pupils, particularly older teenagers, can pass on the virus in the same way as adults.But health professionals have warned of growing pressure on services with Professor Andrew Goddard, president of

A swan’s wing overheadreminds you of his Fifthbut also of his death, that skeinbreaking away to circle himas if to announce what year it was.At this age, every instinct shoutsbehind you – as it did at the pantofor the ghost – and there’s an old manat a lake still counting wild birdswho hasn’t even noticed the time.January is Janus’s month. We should lookboth ways. The geese have put their ersionsigns in the sky, but the sun holds upits lollipop as if a young hero mightcross, find an egg, tie a knot in it.The landscape is appropriately bare and bird-encircled. As the opening statement emphasises, this landscape is not simply physical: it’s also that of a year that has just begun. Greening, born in 1954, gives the date of the poem as 2015, a significant date marking 150 years since the composer’s birth in 1865, and also reflecting, perhaps, Greening’s own closeness in age to Sibelius at the time of “the silence”.While “a swan’s wing overhead” signifies the triumphant Fifth Symphony, with its famous third-movement “swan motif”, Greening picks up the para-rhyme of “fifth” with “death” and revises an anecdote from the Sibelius biography. While out for his morning walk, the composer saw a flock of cranes, one of which broke away from the others and circled over the composer’s family house, Ainola. (In the poem, it’s a “skein” rather than one bird.) Sibelius seems to have viewed this as an omen: in fact, he died a few days later.The more general premonitions of mortality receive partly comic treatment in the second stanza. That famous pantomime phrase, traditionally shouted by the audience (“it’s behind you!”) takes on a different meaning in the absence of inverted commas or italics. “At this age, every instinct shouts  behind you – as it did at the panto  for the ghost”. We might think that “it” is death. At the same time, grammatically, it’s also that “every instinct” is located “behind you” – another very alarming thought. And perhaps there’s an ambiguity, too, about the ghost. In the pantomime scene, the intruder, not always a ghost, steals up behind the character who’s trying to escape it. Greening’s phrasing suggests that the ghost might be haunted by a live pursuer. Briskly moving on (this poem is fast on its feet) the ghost leads us to “the old man” and a pleasantly reassuring portrait of the artist “at a lake still counting wild birds  who hasn’t even noticed the time”.The last stanza further opens up the concept of time, and invites us to participate in the forward movement. The road-safety advice, based on the doubled Janus-face, is to “look both ways”. The “ersion signs” of the geese, and the “lollipop” sun are visually effective, and also cut things down to size – as the “young hero” is cut down to size in having to wait at the school crossing. A strange, mythologically inflected image adds a final lift to the poem’s mood. To “find an egg” and “tie a knot in it” suggests the creative process in magical microcosm. It recurs in The Silence as an image of Sibelius’s hoped-for but finally unavailable renewal. In the formal structure of The Silence lies one illustration of the way a poet ties the knots that sustain imaginative vitality without strangling it. Sibelius (the poem) shows us another way, via the movement of fleet-footed images.“Make beauty of disaster  and tragedy of utter bliss” advises the composer’s voice to himself in The Silence, “take the turn of the year with you”. This last is a compelling thought.Contemporary poets are luckier than famous national composers, perhaps. The ghost behind them is only time after all, and less scary than the audience of promoters and fans impatiently awaiting the new great work.May January 2021 bring optimism and a new start for all of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81ad6e5e44e29ee58f771e7395056e1ed2464b9/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b7866eadc914faa98c418bdfbbf1ac1","title":"ladbrokes entain bid us mgm","story":"American casino company is seeking to expand its online operationsThe owner of the Ladbrokes and Coral betting brands has said an £8bn takeover bid from its US joint-venture partner, MGM Resorts International, significantly undervalues the business.Entain said the offer by MGM, the owner of the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas, undervalued the British group, and questioned the rationale for a merger, in a statement to the stock market on Monday morning.The company, known as GVC Holdings until last month after shareholders voted for a name change, started the 5050 joint-venture, BetMGM, with the US group in 2018, offering online sports betting and casino games in the growing number of US states where it is legal.The 2018 push to launch online gambling came after the US supreme court removed a large obstacle to sports betting, which had previously been banned in every state barring Nevada.Sports betting is still regulated on a state-by-state basis, but analysts believe that more states are likely to legalise it soon.

Borrowing soared to £5.7bn in November, up by £1.2bn from the level in October.The number of new mortgage approvals – which provide an early indicator for borrowing levels in future months when buyers take up their mortgage offers – have increased more than tenfold, after hitting a low point of 9,400 in May.Despite the boom in mortgage approvals – equivalent to the last days of the mid-2000s property bubble when zero-deposit mortgages were still widely available – analysts warn that a sharp drop in activity is looming.The UK housing market boomed in 2020, with property prices soaring to a six-year high as people rushed to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday and re-evaluated their living arrangements during lockdown.Faced with the potential downturn, lenders have made it tougher for buyers with smaller deposits to purchase a home – hitting first-time buyers.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said demanded looked set to remain strong right up until the starting threshold for paying stamp duty – the tax paid on property purchases – returns to £125,000, from £500,000 at present.House price growth is however expected to return in 2022, according to analysts, despite the cost of a home rising out of reach for increasing numbers of people in recent years.Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at the estate agents Knight Frank, said: “While the end of the stamp duty holiday in March will clearly have an impact on transaction numbers, the effect will be reduced if the pandemic has entered the endgame. Some buyers and sellers may hesitate in coming weeks, but sentiment will ultimately improve over the course of the year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bad75ab39ac27b1f632f5f56b4b42eb57ac28f8b/0_99_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e3c4f39c6b0dedd40776d00b2dafb93","title":"markets boosted oxford astrazeneca covid coronavirus vaccine rollout begins stocks economy pound manufacturing business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news as investors bet on the success of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccineTime to check back in on US futures, which are pointing to record highs for the Dow and S\u0026ampP at the start of trading this afternoon: Hundreds of Google employees have reportedly formed a union, in a rare move at a Silicon Valley tech firm, which is expected to raise tensions with the company’s leadership. Google had fired employees involved in organising a worker union as recently as mid-December. The New York Times (£) said the group is known as the Alphabet Workers Union - referring to Google’s parent company – and was formed in secret over the past year. Its leadership was elected last month and is now affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, which represents telecoms and media staff in the US and Canada. However, it is a so-called minority union that currently represents around 225 of the company’s 260,000 full-time staff and contractors. Workers told the NYT that it was primarily part of efforts to give structure and longevity to activism at Google, rather than trying to force employers to the table to negotiate a contract for workers. The paper has quotes Google’s director of people operations as saying: We’ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our work force. Of course, our employees have protected labour rights that we support. But as we’ve always done, we’ll continue engaging directly with all our employees. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould comments on the FTSE 100’s surging start to 2021: MGM’s blockbuster bid for gambling group Entain and plumbing firm Ferguson’s sale of its UK business play second fiddle to the vaccine news which is an even more important focus for the markets given the more severe restrictions necessitated by a more infectious strain of Covid.For now investors clearly believe the vaccine will provide the catalyst for a big recovery, perhaps after a tough first quarter, but getting enough of the population inoculated will be a big logistical challenge. A key determining factor could be whether the existing vaccines prevent transmission of Covid or just infection – this could determine how quickly we return to normality and how patient the market might be. It comes as the largest-listed stocks make gains across the UK and mainland Europe: Bitcoin prices have fallen sharply this morning, dropping by around $4,000 from the record peak it hit on Sunday. Bitcoin’s value has surged, with Sunday’s record high coming less than three weeks after trading above $20,000 for the first time. As my colleague Graeme Wearden explained yesterday, some sceptics warn that the crypto boom could be heading for trouble, and that the coin itself has no intrinsic value. There are more than 18m bitcoins in existence, created by the miners who provide the computational power underpinning the blockchain, which records transactions made using bitcoin. The system has a hardwired maximum of 21m coins.BREAKING: The German government and state authorities have agreed on extending lockdown until 31 January.That’s according to Reuters, which is citing local newspaper Bild.UK lenders approved nearly 105,000 new mortgages in November, the highest number since the global financial crisis in August 2007. That was up from over 98,300 in October and defied Reuters forecasts for a total 82,500 approvals, according to newly-released Bank of England data. It comes as home buyers rush to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday, before it comes to an end on 31 March. However, unsecured lending fell by £1.5bn as borrowers made larger payments on their debts.It follows a net repayment of £700m in October. The bulk of the repayments were on credit cards. Households lucky enough not to be hit by job cuts and a loss of income also managed to put more money aside in November. The data shows deposits increased by £17.6bn in November, up from £12.7bn in October.Though it’s worth keeping in mind that the blue chip index is still roughly 1,000 points below January 2020 levels, before Covid-19 was declared a pandemic. DATA FLASH: UK manufacturing activity rose to its highest level since November 2017 last month. Manufacturing PMI rose to 57.5 in December compared to 55.6 a month earlier. It came as factories rushed to finish work before the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. However, experts warned that those activity levels would not last, so expect weaker readings in the first few months of 2021.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said:The manufacturing PMI rose to its highest level in over three years in December, mainly reflecting a boost from last-minute preparations before the end of the Brexit transition period. Customers, especially those based in the EU, brought forward purchases, boosting sales temporarily. It seems likely that this boost will reverse in the opening months of 2021, making for a weak start to the year. Note also that the December PMI data were collected prior to the border closures, which will have led to further logistics and production disruptions for many companies. Not only is the euro gaining on the back of strong manufacturing PMI data, but sterling’s post-Brexit deal rally is facing. The pound jumped in the wake of news that UK and EU officials had struck a last minute trade deal on Christmas Eve.

Instead we should be working out how to keep everyone in education safeThe crisis enveloping schools, and the noisy resentment it has sparked, reflect just about every aspect of England’s Covid-19 story. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has taken the government’s grim mixture of arrogance and incompetence to new depths. When Boris Johnson was interviewed by Andrew Marr today it was striking to see so much of the conversation devoted to schools, but there was a wearying familiarity to the vagueness of the prime minister’s position on urgent issues. The fact that there is no clear line even on the proposed opening of all schools in England a fortnight from now hardly answers people’s need for clarity and leadership.Yet again councils, who are only too aware of local realities, have objected to edicts from Whitehall. In London, boroughs that rejected the demand that their primary schools open on 4 January forced yet another government U-turn. Meanwhile, as concerns grow about the new variant spreading via schools, talk of “a switch to online learning” is now common – yet this could exacerbate many hard realities that have emerged during the pandemic. For plenty of families, “connectivity” amounts to a pay-as-you-go smartphone running on a mobile network in millions of cases, remote learning is a completely vain hope.Though the past nine months have seen contrasts in leadership between England and the rest of the UK, none of the four nations has realigned its education system to anything like the extent the pandemic demands. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, teachers’ unions have responded to plans to open schools this month with the same scepticism and opposition seen in England. But clearly, there are levels of rancorousness and disarray on display in the English system – gripped by stubborn and nostalgic Tory thinking for more than a decade – that set it apart. Hit by something as big as the pandemic, it was probably always going to teeter into failure.Beyond the immediate crisis over what should happen to schools, the extremities of the pandemic have yet to shift one key article of Tory faith: that pupils must still prepare to sit GCSEs, A-levels and most of the Sats that kids in English schools take when they are 11. Though the Scottish and Welsh governments have called off this summer’s exams, ministers in Westminster are apparently hellbent on pressing ahead, albeit with a few supposedly generous tweaks. Even as normality continues to collapse, the government insists that exams are the “best and fairest way for young people to show what they know and can do” and that SATs provide “vital information”. Last week, I spoke to Michelle Sheehy, the co-headteacher of Millfield Primary in Brownhills, near Walsall – somewhere I have visited twice in recent years, reporting first on cuts to school budgets, then the pandemic’s impact on education. The tyranny of Sats, she told me, means some of her staff will soon have to spend long hours teaching year 6 pupils the kind of “test technique” (how long to spend on questions, what to look for when they’re reading) that will maximise their scores. Right now, such things seem laughably irrelevant.When they begin secondary school in September, her current year 6 students will be assessed anyway. “Children will be coming back to school having not had time with their friends and their families – if they’ve been in isolation, they haven’t been able to see their close relatives,” she says. “There’s so much we need to do with them to get their spirits up and negate the effects of the virus. I don’t want to spend that time preparing them for Sats.”Since the arrivals of Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings at the Department for Education (DfE) in the early years of the coalition government, the schools system in England has somehow been both increasingly fragmented and woefully centralised. The curriculum has become far too old-fashioned and inflexible, highlighted by loud complaints from teachers about the closing down of space for initiative and invention.Though Williamson’s surreal incompetence is clear, the crisis his reign at the DfE has prompted goes much deeper. As we have been reminded, education needs to be resilient, adaptable, and run on the expertise and passion of those who actually deliver it. But by marginalising councils, killing teachers’ morale, favouring the old-fashioned over the forward-looking, and scoffing at the more nurturing child-centred aspects of education, the Tories built a system that failed on all these counts.The anxieties Covid-19 has loaded on to teachers and support staff, and the arduous realities of their work in the pandemic, are still underappreciated. Vaccinations for people who work in schools and a functioning testing system for staff and pupils are now matters of huge urgency. But there are also ways that schools could deliver at least some education in safer circumstances than the standard classroom that should have been tried way before this new meltdown.From unions and some enlightened politicians there have been proposals for “Nightingale schools”, which might shift lessons to new, larger spaces (think of all the empty theatres, cinemas and music venues), but they have come to nothing. In Belgium and Denmark, schools have moved some of their operations to public buildings and outdoor locations. In many US states, teaching has been shifted into the open air – which has continued amid snowy weather in Maine, Colorado and New Hampshire. In the balmy conditions of the first lockdown, why wasn’t an expansion of that approach not widely trialled in the UK, so it could have been used even in the winter?The questions go on. Though there are now promises of a million laptops and tablets for poorer households, why has the government failed so pathetically so far? Could the idea of blended learning, whereby pupils go to school part-time in smaller classes, finally achieve more prominence? Given that the internet does not reach many households, why hasn’t television been more thoroughly used to make up for the interruptions to schooling?There are plenty of reasons to feel downcast about the state we are in, but this one is particularly painful. No field of policy is more important than state education, and in the past year a whole set of dated and rigid ideas about education has been tested to destruction. It is now time to come up with something new."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/828f7e3488bc62e2622f506462aa732c96549623/0_66_1992_1195/master/1992.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8d88f2b2437ee967410e91832303efdb","title":"covid model epidemic collaboration experiment","story":"The pandemic has created a tragic ‘natural experiment’ - a once-in-a-century jolt that could produce unexpected insightsThink back on some of the things you learned about Covid-19 in 2020: information such as “fatality risk” and “incubation period” the potential for “super-spreading events” , and the fact that transmission can happen before symptoms appear. There were the suggestions in mid-January that the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan was much larger than initial reports suggested, and we learned how Wuhan’s subsequent lockdown led to a reduction in transmission. What links these early insights? All of them involved epidemic modelling, which would become a prominent part of the Covid-19 response.In essence, a model is a structured way of thinking about the dynamics of an epidemic. It allows us to take the knowledge we have, make some plausible assumptions based on that knowledge, then look at the logical implications of those assumptions. We can then compare our results with available datasets, to understand what might be driving the patterns we see. Models can help us make sense of patchy early data and explore possible outcomes – such as future epidemic waves – that haven’t happened yet.During prior disease epidemics, such as swine flu in 2009 and Ebola in 2014–15, the public rarely got to see modelling insights until they were later published in scientific papers. In contrast, Covid-19 researchers have routinely built online dashboards so people can track transmission levels and compare possible scenarios, while also making pre-print reports rapidly available. In their efforts to understand the new coronavirus variants detected in the UK and South Africa, researchers have shared real-time modelling analysis of genetic data and case trends, with platforms such as Nextstrain making it possible to see how these variants are spreading globally.Despite these developments, the pandemic has shown there is still more to do. Outbreak research should ideally be fast, reliable and publicly available. But the pressures of real-time Covid-19 analysis – which many academics have done in their spare time without dedicated funding – can force difficult choices. Should researchers prioritise updating scenarios for governments and health agencies, writing detailed papers describing their methods, or helping others adapt the models to answer different questions? These are not new problems, but the pandemic gave them new urgency. In the US, for example, the most comprehensive Covid-19 databases have been run by volunteers. The pandemic has flagged inefficient and unsustainable features of modelling and outbreak analysis, and illustrated that there is a clear need for change.Alongside coverage of specific modelling studies, mathematical concepts have also become part of everyday discussions. Whether talking about reproduction numbers, lags in data, or how vaccines might protect the non-vaccinated through “herd immunity”, journalists have started to think more deeply about epidemic dynamics. Prior to the outbreak, I never thought I’d end up fielding media requests to discuss a statistical parameter such as “K”, which quantifies the potential for super-spreading.Unfortunately, there have been challenges with coverage too. Some modelling results – particularly in the early stages of the pandemic – were widely misinterpreted, like the headlines in March suggesting half of the UK might have already been infected. Throughout summer and autumn, research groups also had to contend with media critics who misled the public with claims that the pandemic was over, dismissing warnings about the potential for a large second wave.Given the European epidemic waves to date, there can be little doubt that in the absence of control measures, Covid-19 would have been catastrophic for our health systems. Across the world, populations altered their behaviour in response to growing epidemics, but the extent of this unprecedented shift – and its effect on spread – was extremely hard to predict at the start of last year. Although infections such as Ebola and Sars have previously spurred behaviour change, Covid-19 triggered shutdowns of society on a scale unseen since the 1918 influenza pandemic.As well as modelling the spread of disease, researchers have had to track the dynamics of social behaviour. Because of modern digital footprints, they have been able to do this in more detail than ever, providing unique insights into how iniduals and communities respond to outbreaks. These behavioural changes, whether driven by explicit government policies or local awareness of infection risk, have in turn had complex social, economic and health impacts. Untangling such effects will no doubt be the subject of research far into the future.Covid-19 has cemented a growing trend for research teams that work across multiple aspects of disease dynamics, from modelling and epidemiology to immunology and human behaviour. In the UK, researchers involved in modelling the disease have set up studies of social interactions and infection levels within communities, with these datasets then feeding back into new models.As well as interdisciplinary links, there have also been new international connections. Political responses to the pandemic have been country-specific, but throughout 2020, scientific insights – including datasets, modelling results and code – have been shared and built upon by teams across multiple continents. Past epidemics have brought mathematical tools to new audiences, but the scale of Covid-19 has resulted in epidemiological ideas being exchanged across disciplines and borders as never before. If sustained, such collaborations and networks could be hugely valuable in tackling other global epidemic challenges in future.The events of last year have altered the dynamics of many diseases, beyond Covid-19, as seen in the disappearance of certain seasonal infections or the disruption of vaccination programmes. Had the pandemic not happened, I would have spent much of 2020 abroad, setting up studies of influenza, Zika and dengue. When these projects eventually resume, will we see smaller outbreaks than before, or belated large epidemics? The pandemic has created a tragic “natural experiment”, a once-in-a-century jolt to disease ecosystems that could produce unexpected insights into immunity, social behaviour, seasonal effects and evolution. We’ve learned a lot about Covid-19 in the past 12 months, but there’s much more that modelling will help us discover in the coming years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34f5e9b940b5faf2691d8cccfef00e87e25f6e69/0_0_3543_2124/master/3543.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bdcb54a38cfb82158c13f4eaea9303fe 930w","title":"parents in england how have you been affected by the delay to schools reopening","story":"We would like to hear from parents about childcare after some local authorities closed schools the day before children were due to returnIn parts of England, parents face more uncertainty as some local authorities delayed the reopening of schools due to the rise in coronavirus cases in the country.

At its most primal, it involves deliberately releasing animals such as beavers or wolves in the belief that the re-entry of a single alpha species brings with it a cascade of ecological benefits.Either way, rewilding has come to be associated with big acreages, whether that be at Knepp Park in Sussex or at the 18,000-acre Glenfeshie estate in the Cairngorms. The perception is that it is expensive, far away and often inaccessible. It certainly isn’t something that just anyone can do.But what if the wildest places of all were right under our feet? In the forgotten spaces in our cities, rewilding has always happened naturally, , land falling under stone and resurging again, concrete lids flipped off before submerging once more. In the margins and the demilitarised zones, the abandoned embankments, the bits we don’t want or the lands already contaminated beyond human tolerance, ecology is thriving.In some places – such as the land around the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine – plant and insect life has adapted to the extreme conditions: boars have moved in, there is a new radiation-munching fungus and, in the thin strip of no-man’s land between the borders of North and South Korea, leopards and Asiatic black bears have been spotted. In the past century, Greenham Common in Berkshire has transformed from open heathland grazing to the home of US Trident missiles to an SSSI nature reserve with a weedy runway.In Scotland, the 40-mile strip between Glasgow and Edinburgh has always been mined, for not just coal, but stone, gravel, lead and even gold. After centuries of hard pickings, parts of Lanarkshire and Ayrshire have an upended appearance. What was underground is now on top and what was above has gone below, with buildings and bridges slumped over old drift mines and razor-lined spoil heaps terraced by extraction tracks. Wildfowl nest on lochs made from old coal holes and an orchid called Young’s helleborine, discovered in 1975, favours only the best iron ore.The Ardeer peninsula in Ayrshire is home to the unusually bracing combination of a nudist beach and an explosives factory once owned and operated by the Alfred Nobel Company. Parts of the site are still in use, but most of the 330-acre site was long ago abandoned. Along the cracks in the old pipelines and through the decaying buildings, it would be quicker to list the native plants that are no longer there than those that are.In theory, industry and mining companies are supposed to follow restoration plans for abandoned sites, but in practice they often plead poverty. Besides, ecologists sometimes find themselves ensnared in a paradox. Public feeling is that big business should be obliged to make good what it has taken, but human attempts to restore land are often amateurish. Planting a few conifers and flinging around a mix of wildflowers may be a quick fix, but sometimes it appears that the best thing to do is nothing.The M74 motorway runs up the front of Scotland past new windfarms and second world war PoW camps. Not far from Broken Cross, Europe’s largest opencast coal mine, there’s Castle Dangerous. In 1913 the 13th Earl of Home tried to lift local unemployment at Douglas by allowing mining nearby. The mining unseated the castle, it was demolished, and the flooded workings (known locally as the Black Hole) are now so patterned with commuting birdlife that it resembles an avian Heathrow.Further up the motorway, near Port Glasgow, the old timber ponds attract birds of a seaborne kind. The ponds are shallow estuarine mudflats ided by ancient wooden stakes (or stabs) and were once used to grade and store logs for shipbuilding. It is an atmospheric place, the stabs shrouded in black weed like cartoon ghouls while beyond them the lights of Dunbarton shine over the water. Poking around in the mud and sunken tyres I hear a curlew for the first time this year, its song for an instant rhyming with an ambulance siren.On the other side of the Clyde, between the Erskine Bridge and the old John Brown shipyard, lies what used to be the Beardmore naval construction works in Dalmuir. In the early 20th century it produced munitions, planes, submarines and warships before being converted into a fuel-supply depot and then being gradually abandoned.Now a cycle path runs through it, but otherwise there is nothing new here except nature: golden leaves of birch springing from the concrete jetty, hawkweed drifting Ophelia-like in the drowned oil storage tanks, wrens nesting in the rusted embankments, mallards cackling from the blackthorn scrub. “Have you seen the deer?” asks a dog walker. There are two, apparently – one red, one roe, both favouring the grazing just beneath the giant electricity pylon.Dalmuir is beautiful, dangerous – and almost certainly contaminated. Like many of the other sites, it has always been used by more than just squirrels and crows. Since industry retreated it has been a flytip, a heroin shooting gallery and probably a place to dispose of worse things than just old mattresses.Halflands like these can be among the most joyous and optimistic places on earth, but they can also carry with them a polluting sense of menace. Finding them means that you may end up meandering across an indeterminate line between a walk in the park and full-scale urban exploration you explore at your own risk. Some places encourage public interest and others, despite Scotland’s differing access laws, discourage it.They also have a habit of vanishing. Brownfield sites tend to be classified as wasteland, and with the pressure on housing, they are first in line for redevelopment. Ardeer is intended for “regeneration” and Dalmuir will shortly be dug up to make way for the Scottish Marine Technology Park, a deepwater ship hoist and a new small-vessel fabrication yard. Malin Group, which owns the site, says it will create 600 short-term jobs and give a multimillion-pound boost to the local economy, which it claims is “sure to bring back to life this area of the river”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/add4c9e93a3a1062d56b5ae80108b73715a02afe/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=078cda5dfe6471c0a2e1958119ab7ad7","title":"rachel roddy recipe for rice and cabbage soup","story":"Somewhere between a soup and a risotto, this soothing dish is one to win over cabbage scepticsThe problem with liking cabbage so much is that I often smell of it. Not the most charismatic way to start a column, I know, especially the first of the year – happy new year! – but it is the truth, and a significant part of my eating life. As a child, I discovered that liking cabbage carried a risk: that of being called smelly, although this didn’t stop me eating all my school lunch, then offering to finish my friend’s. Young trauma faded into twentysomething worries about my sulphurous hair, although this didn’t stop me eating the cabbage soup I prescribed myself. But then, in my early 30s, I found myself living in a building that, thanks to a trattoria serving a typically Roman and therefore cruciferous menu, smelled more strongly of cabbage (also of broccoli, chicory and spinach) than I did. It was like meeting a kindred spirit, only made of bricks and cement I fitted right in.I am exaggerating, of course – but only slightly. Our building is a cabbage and broccoli bong much of the time the sulphurous scent hanging around the courtyard and communal stairwells like fruit flies around half a melon in high summer. The smell is not alone: the bread shop, the bar dispatching espressos, bins and various degrees of home cooking all compete for airspace. But the scent of cabbage prevails. And I like the pong as much as the flavour of this great, green vegetable named after a head, especially deep-green savoy, with its blasted leaves and tree-like rib that taste like chlorophyll, iron, mustard and nutty butter.If the smell is a bother, though, there are ways and whole websites dedicated to what Jane Grigson describes as the original sin. A cup of coffee with a tablespoon of vinegar left near the pan a slice of bread soaked with vinegar positioned near the pan is likewise said to soak up unwanted smells a bowl of water with bicarb or half a potato. Ingredients added to the cabbage while cooking can also help: vinegar, milk, bay leaves, potato. Maybe the Neapolitans, the original mangiafoglia (leaf eaters), know this. Or maybe it is simply that bay and potato made such good additions to a minestra di verza e riso, or virz’e rise, a soothing dish of cabbage with rice and parmesan that is somewhere between a soup and a risotto. The slow cooking of the cabbage in butter (which is my non-traditional addition) and oil reduces it almost to a cream, which, having given its scent to the room (and the cup of coffee with vinegar), is softly vegetal and savourythanks to the umami power of a parmesan rind (one of the best seasonings known to soup, as well as a soft, chewy fringe benefit for the cook).The Neapolitan friend who taught me how to make this dish refers to it as a toccasana, a cure-all, and I agree. And while it isn’t a please-all, it is certainly a dish to win over cabbage sceptics. It’s also cheap, generous and, smells aside, one that fits in.1 large savoy cabbage5 tbsp olive oil20g butter1 onion, peeled and thinly sliced1 garlic clove, peeled and minced2 bay leavesSalt and black pepper30g parmesan, grated, plus 1 parmesan rind200g rice (carnaroli or vialone nano)Trim the base of the cabbage, pulling away any tough leaves, then cut in quarters, remove the core and slice the rest into fine ribbons. In a heavy-based pan, warm the oil and butter, then add the cabbage, onion, garlic and bay leaves, and stir well so everything is coated in oil. Cook for a few minutes, then lower the heat, cover the pan and leave to cook gently for 45 minutes, or until the cabbage has collapsed completely.Mash the cabbage with a fork so it breaks up, then add a litre and a half of water, a pinch of salt and the parmesan rind. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.Add the rice and simmer, stirring often, for 20 minutes, or until the rice is tender. I order that the final consistency is soft and thick, but still soupy, so you may need to add more water. Stir in the parmesan and lots of freshly ground black pepper, then serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50000fe4e8d542e79bcdde8f024b953ae79de293/81_394_5079_3047/master/5079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a8073d66c87555569a1ebebc60cfad2","title":"life in the football cocoon photo essay premier league coronavirus lockdown","story":"’s sport photographer  Tom Jenkins gives his perspective of covering the national sport behind closed doors in football’s strangest yearIt’s day two of lockdown 2 and a perfect night for watching football: cold and crisp with a slight mist descending. Ninety minutes before the kick-off, I’m outside St Mary’s Stadium in Southampton. Around me is the occasional patrolling steward and a few TV technicians carrying kit into the ground. The silence is interrupted only by the cracks of fireworks from across the city.Suddenly a loud bellow from just beyond the waist-high perimeter fencing shocks me. “Come on you Reds,” a cyclist shouts as he pedals by. He looks at me and shrugs: “Well someone has to say it, haven’t they?” On he goes, repeating his chant as he disappears into the darkness. By the end of the evening, Southampton will be top of the Premier League for the first time.In June, when Project Restart was in its infancy, football behind closed doors seemed like a quirky interruption. We were all just so glad to have it back in any form. How we smiled to see crossbars being sprayed with disinfectant and away teams emerging from unusual corners of the stadium, perhaps having changed in a version of the groundsman’s hut.Those motivational tarpaulins masking empty seats, resplendent with club mottos, were colourful and cheery. It was summertime, there were five substitutes allowed and drinks breaks. Now that all seems a long time ago and it feels very different.With winter here, darkness has enveloped the grounds the floodlights are on, bathing not only the pitches but also the surrounding communities in a milky glow. From outside it is now even more obvious that a game is going on, a clear beacon to fans that a party is happening and they don’t have an invitation. It is seven months since football returned. Through all this I have been a lucky one: a photographer – one of the few to be let in.I’m in Liverpool on the opening day of the season and I have time to spare before a tantalising match between the champions and promoted Leeds. On the gable end of a house in a typical Anfield street is a newly painted mural of Jordan Henderson lifting the Premier League trophy.As I photograph it, a woman takes out her phone and does the same. I cannot help but feel guilty, I’m off to see this fascinating match and she almost certainly is not. I think of her again after the match and feel even worse. A breathtaking game has ended 4-3, the sort of game that lifts your heart and confirms why you love football, why you go through the turnstiles to watch it.A couple of days later I am on the other side of the Pennines for Sheffield United v Wolves. The talk on the radio is of a possible return of fans. There is a sense of positivity that we will be out of this before long now. Wolves score two early goals and I imagine the vitriol that would have poured down from the vast Kop stand behind me.Filling out health clearance forms and temperature checks are now part of my routine, like packing my camera bags. At Chelsea in early October, having lugged my gear to the front entrance, I am hot and sweating. The temperature steward aims the little white gun at my forehead. “That’s 32.2,” he says. “Surely I’d be having organ failure if that was true,” I reply. The steward duly waves me through.I have done quite a few games at Chelsea in recent months and have talked with a friendly steward who hands out our sanitised photographer bibs. She tells me how fearful she is for some of the regulars in the West stand, especially for their mental health. She recalls how coming to the ground, seeing everyone there, being part of that community, has been like having a second family, helping her through some difficult personal times.Just before a match starts, I have often found myself walking the empty concourses behind the stands. Before, these places would be vibrant and buzzing with anticipation places where friends would meet up, drink and laugh, around them walls painted in club colours. Now they are like haunted houses.Evidence of what used to be keeps popping up – the bookies odds for first goalscorer still scrawled up on whiteboards, adverts promoting events in March. I can’t stop staring at the ones imploring people to go to the now notorious Cheltenham Festival in 2020.At Selhurst Park, I have been able to go to the back of the Arthur Wait stand and retrace the steps I used to take as a kid. Back then it was always down the same set of steep stairs from the same turnstiles on Park Road to the concourse at the back of the stand then out to the terraces or seats. The memories flood back.Come Halloween, I’m in a rain-lashed Sheffield to see United take on Manchester City. My allotted parking place is by a wall where names of fans are chiselled into each brick. On the other side of this wall, a dozen sodden fans are peering over, trying to get a tiny glimpse of the players getting off their buses.Before the game I chat to a steward. “It’s bonkers,” he says. “They’ll be ramming into pubs right now and as long as they have a pie with their pint, they can watch this match on a big screenWhy can’t some sit and watch it in here?”On the drive home, I hear on the radio the prime minister announce another national lockdown. The prospect of fans being back in grounds such as Bramall Lane seems a distant hope. An empty Wembley is the ultimate echo chamber on a matchday.When the players from Manchester City and Everton lined up before the Women’s FA Cup final to hear an immaculately dressed singer belt out Abide with Me, the anthem performed at just about every Cup final since 1927, it is eerie. I am so used to a huge crowd participating. The hymn’s meaning seems even more moving right now, given the pandemic. The emptiness of the stands feels almost crushing.During the past few months, the fans I have felt most sorry for are probably those of Brentford and AFC Wimbledon. Both clubs have moved into new stadiums, usually a time for celebration, but this has not happened. Only at the beginning of December did a few Brentford fans get the chance to sample their new home.It was in early September that I attended the first competitive match there. The perfect grass, cutting-edge architecture, multicoloured empty seats – it felt like I was watching a video game. I was also at the new Plough Lane for the “grand” opening of the ground, 29 years after they played their last game nearby as Wimbledon FC.The only presence of the Wimbledon fans who resurrected the club in 2002 is themselves as cardboard cutouts. It was a bittersweet night. My friend and colleague Daffydd, a lifelong Dons fan, has been suffering awfully with motor neurone disease. The next day I email Daff to tell him how great the stadium is and that the managing director has promised to get him there as soon as possible. He doesn’t reply. Five days later Daff passes away.In late November, I’m at Fulham v Everton. A new stand is being built on the river side of the ground . At the end of the match, a workman emerges from the building site, speaking Portuguese. He persuades Richarlison, Everton’s Brazilian forward, to give him his shirt. Richarlison, seeming only too happy to be speaking to a real fan, climbs up and throws him the memento.In Canvey Island, Essex, Steve Marks is up a ladder erected on the flat garage roof next to his bungalow. A huge Union Jack is stiff to the breeze on a flagpole behind him as a freezing cold squall blows through. Fully decked out in waterproofs, he looks like the captain of a ship steering through a storm. About 50 yards away his team are playing their biggest match ever, a second-round FA Cup tie against Boreham Wood, which is live on BT Sport. “I couldn’t miss this,” he says, twirling his old-fashioned rattle, the sort that only seems to come out for cup ties. Other fans are on ladders, banging on a blue corrugated iron fence that rings the ground. “Two days later and we’d be in there,” one says, referring to the end of lockdown . “Typical, the biggest day in our club history and look at us.”With about five minutes to go, Boreham Wood’s burly centre-forward, Matt Rhead, nods in the third goal. Throughout the match he bore the brunt of the chants from the Canvey Ultras. He laps it up, playing the pantomime villain to perfection, joined by his teammates. Boy, how I’ve missed this – the moment when a goal is scored, when scorers and fans unite. It’s the whole reason and point of the game.When fans are not present, you can hear the net ripple and the scorers don’t know what to do with themselves. It usually ends up in a tame high-five or a polite handshake as if we are back in the 1950s. At least with a few spectators to see them, the players have got a reason to unfurl their best routines and a goal is celebrated properly.The lockdown is lifted on 2 December and clubs in tier 2 areas are allowed to host 2,000 spectators at matches. This means a whole new world for the fan, one of arrows, one-way systems and advice everywhere. At West Ham, the huge screen on the side of the London Stadium scrolls through slides saying ‘welcome home’ and then urges ‘hands, face, space’.At Brighton, Southampton are the first visitors to play in front of fans. James Ward-Prowse is about to take a corner in front of the baying Seagulls supporters in the North stand. The hulking figure of Jannik Vestergaard, the Southampton centre-back, slowly walked into the penalty box. “Oi, Vestergaard, you mutant,” one wag shouts. The rest of the fans laugh. Everyone, including all of the players, hears it. The ball is crossed in and flies off the centre-back’s forehead into the net. Cue exuberant celebration.As Old Trafford is in tier 3, fans still cannot attend. The 80th Manchester derby to be played there is the first behind closed doors. It is a dreadfully dull game and the lack of passion on and off the pitch cripples the spectacle. These sporting cathedrals were built to enable many people to watch football together. The sermon is still being preached but there is no congregation, no hymns to reverberate round the cobwebbed pews.Football grounds are also places for socialising, for seeing friends and for escaping reality for a few precious hours. It is not for nothing that fans refer to their ground as “home”. Think about why West Ham greeted their fans back with a welcome home message, why there is a banner inside Old Trafford saying “we can’t wait to welcome you home”. For millions of fans, their club’s ground is a place where they feel safe and secure, where they can share emotions both good and bad.So here we are now, seven months on from the restart of football. This pandemic has reinforced how important fans are to the game: they are the foundation on which these clubs are built. Players come and go, but the fan is there, supporting their teams with pride and passion.I look on with envy as grounds are packed out in Australia and New Zealand while our national game limps on through the hardest of winters. I can’t wait for it to break free of this cocoon-like state and a return to the football we all know and love.For Daff, a great man who loved his family, his football and his photography."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5e5a810069c2efec719407afd20a152d390921f/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f7b09d46e21cc12312f0c473e8ba5aaf","title":"the months best album reviews","story":"While the sheer awfulness of Donald Trump’s presidency has inspired protest songs from across the spectrum of musical genres over the past four years, rock bands have been relatively quiet. Not so Alabama-via-Georgia’s Drive-By Truckers: coming only 11 months after their album The Unraveling tackled issues such as migrant children in cages and the US’s opioid epidemic, The New OK feels like a companion record, an unflinching, reportage-driven verdict on a tumultuous year and a deeply damaging presidential term that has polarised their country.The rousing The Perilous Night, in particular, is unambiguously apocalyptic, with Patterson Hood singing: “Fascism’s knocking and Trump says ‘Let them in’”, and warning of “flags of oppression” that are “blocking out the light”. Sarah’s Flame, meanwhile, is cloaked in deceptively gentle swaying country rock but rails against Sarah Palin for preparing the ground for “fat Donnie”. Elsewhere, the anger is replaced with a sense of helplessness at the collapse of order in the more reflective Watching the Orange Clouds, written in response to the protests – and counter-protests – in Hood’s adopted home town of Portland, Oregon, following the killing of George Floyd. (In that respect it feels like a sequel to 2016’s What It Means, a powerful rumination on the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown.) At a time of such ision, it’s a startlingly brave record and all the more necessary for it.“It’s the only way I knew to say goodbye,” says Steve Earle of this album honouring his late son, Justin Townes Earle, a talented singer-songwriter from the same mould as his famous father: the same mix of Americana influences, the same wearied twang to his vocals, the same inspired way with a lyric. Sadly, too, the same dysfunctional family history, which meant that in boyhood Justin saw little of his father, with his teens quickly curdling into rebellion and substance abuse. In and out of addiction, in August this year “JT” fell foul of a cocainefentanyl overdose, aged 38.Earle reprises 10 of his son’s songs here, including early material such as Pine Hill, usually described as formative, but which emerges as bright as more praised later work. Justin used a sparer musical palette than Earle Sr, often with a rockabilly feel – the celebrated Harlem River Blues, for example – but the Dukes, a tough, road-worn outfit, tend to iron out their variety. Earle’s vocals, growling and gravelled these days, deliver the songs straight, only occasionally letting a sense of loss intrude. His own song Last Words is hushed and harrowing, taking comfort that the final words between father and son were “I love you”. It took Melbourne’s Avalanches 16 years to follow up the dazzling cut-and-paste alchemy of their debut, Since I Left You. When it did finally arrive, 2016’s Wildflower was more considered, more song-based and featured a slew of big-name collaborators. We Will Always Love You – a mere four years in gestation – feels like a logical progression: it’s another step away from the dancefloor and into the sort of multilayered, blissed-out psychedelia associated with Tame Impala and MGMT, and there is now a staggering array of guest vocalists and musicians, from the one-time Terence Trent D’Arby to Jamie xx Perry Farrell to Blood Orange.That so many disparate talents have been corralled into such a cohesive whole is testament to Robbie Chater and Tony Di Blasi’s vision, with samples meticulously stitched together from a mass of voices and an underlying concept of remembering those singers no longer with us. Indeed, perhaps the most poignant moment comes on Dial D for Devotion, as atop atypically minimal pianostatic backing Karen O intones an old lyric written by the late David Berman, who guested on Wildflower. Listen out, too, for Gold Sky, where Kurt Vile’s drawling sprechgesang is contrasted with a euphoric gospel backing, and Wayne Coyne adds a fragile coda. There’s much to discover here, making it an immersive and rewarding album to go back to again and again. The creative acquisitiveness of improvisation sounds boundless in the work of jazz sax master Sonny Rollins. He turned 90 in September. Every timeless theme and every long-forgotten one, every pop hit or fragment of an aria, every quirky mannerism he has heard in the jostling soundtrack of the world seems to have been filed somewhere in his head. These fragments make warped reappearances live, sometimes in apposite places, sometimes in provocatively oppositional ones. That’s what put the phrase “the greatest living improviser” on the flyers to Rollins’ gigs.He became less wilfully idiosyncratic in later years. But in the 1960s, Rollins often travelled the world with no band of his own, and his instant responsiveness to often unfamiliar partners became legendary. These previously unreleased recordings (one studio session and two live ones) date from a 1967 Netherlands tour, accompanied by young Dutch bassist Ruud Jacobs and drummer Han Bennink, the latter set to become a one-off of the European avant garde.Rollins carried with him a handful of improv-sparking tunes, including the staccato hard-bop hooks Sonnymoon for Two and Miles Davis’s Four and Tune Up, the ballad theme Three Little Words and the standard On Green Dolphin Street. These performances seamlessly segue breakneck bebop drive, old-school romanticism and a probingly inquisitive phrasing that offers suggestions to Jacobs and Bennink and lobs back rejoinders. The studio set’s sound balance is warm and spacious, the live takes less so (Bennink’s irrepressible energy sometimes overdominates). These tracks catch the saxophone colossus in gale-force form with partners right on his case, and the accompanying essays and images expand on that fascinating story.The influence of Rollins and much else drives contemporary saxist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Potter – input from all over the globe contributes to his fine lockdown solo album, There Is a Tide (Edition), in which he overdubs reeds, keys, basses and percussion with a warmth that such techie methods often miss. Innovative British jazz and fusion harpist Tori Handsley emerges as a leader influenced by the current genre-fluid London jazz underground (the Mercury-nominated Moses Boyd is on drums and Ruth Goller on bass) with As We Stand (Cadillac), while meditative Manchester trumpetercomposer Matthew Halsall’s Salute to the Sun (Gondwana) introduces a punchy and vibrant new young band. Resonance Records’ tireless archive-digging reveals Bill Evans Live at Ronnie Scott’s, by the freewheeling piano star’s superb 1968 trio with drum dynamo Jack DeJohnette.Anyone who feels they made insufficient use of 2020’s unexpected glut of spare time is strongly advised to avoid the prologue that Taylor Swift has written to accompany her ninth studio album. It explains that, having already produced one bestselling, critically-acclaimed album while in isolation from Covid-19 – July’s Folklore – Swift and collaborators including the National’s Aaron Dessner, Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon, songwriter Jack Antonoff and her boyfriend Joe Alwyn couldn’t stop writing songs. “It feels like we were standing on the edge of the Folklorian woods and had a choice – to turn and go back or travel further into the forest of this music,” she writes. “We chose to go deeper in.”The result is another album. Not, it should be noted, a collection of offcuts and demos, but a fully-realised hour-long collection of songs rendered in muted, earthy shades: fingerpicked acoustic guitars, pianos playing tumbling, melancholy figures (the one on Tolerate It vaguely recalls the Smiths’ Asleep), electric guitars that teeter on the brink of sounding overdriven, warm, woozy washes of synthesiser, mandolin.Evermore effectively continues the job that Folklore started, moving Swift away from mainstream pop into alt-rockier waters. It’s a smoother, less forced transition than it might be for some of her peers. Swift has already changed tack once in her career – gradually abandoning the glossy Nashville pop of her early albums for something more brash and electronic around the time of 2012’s Red – an early indication of the malleability of her songwriting. Melodically, at least, there doesn’t seem to have been a particularly dramatic shift. There are songs here that would obviously function as pop bangers were they decked out with EDM synths, Auto-Tune and programmed beats – opener Willow, Gold Rush, Long Story Short – but, equally, they don’t feel like they’re straining at the confines of their tasteful acoustic arrangements.The real change is in Swift’s lyrical approach. Evermore declines to perform her old trick of writing songs that guarantee social media posts pondering which ex-boyfriend or frenemy they might concern, although you do get a lot of what you might call Swiftian lyrical tropes for your money: the bad-news girlfriend of Blank Space makes a reappearance on Champagne Problems (“she would’ve made such a lovely bride – what a shame she’s fucked in the head”), while the classic behold-my-mental-anguish-as-I-try-to-comprehend-how-incredibly-hot-my-current-partner-is humblebrag informs Gold Rush: “What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?”Swift is good at character studies. Lovers of gossip might disagree, but the well-drawn portraits of a disenchanted wife on Tolerate It or a distraught recent orcee on Happiness feel substantially more edifying than the stuff she wrote for 2017’s Reputation, bitterly dressing down former chums for their mysterious transgressions. Blessed with a particularly luminous tune, Dorothea cleverly flips the old country cliche in which a star tells you their life of fame and luxury is nothing compared to the warm comfort of their old small-town life. Here, the protagonist gazes at a now-famous friend on TV, vainly trying to convince herself that said old friend was happier living the simple life and might return. And ’Tis the Damn Season offers a neat and rather moving twist on the Christmas song, in which old flames back in town for festive visits to their parents end up in bed together, despite knowing it won’t lead anywhere. Related: The best albums of 2020, No 9: Taylor Swift –\u0026nbspFolklore The album’s unifying aesthetic conceals some sub-par songwriting, all charmingly misty atmospherics and not much substance: were it not for the added interest of the fact it’s Taylor Swift duetting with the National’s Matt Berninger, Coney Island would just be pleasantly unmemorable Pitchfork-friendly alt-rock. A country-rock saga of infidelity leading to two murders, No Body No Crime is fun – in a campy wink to camera, Haim sisters Danielle and Este appear both as backing vocalists and characters in the lyrics – but inconsequential.It’s unclear where the stylistic shift of Folklore and Evermore is heading, whether it’s a momentary ersion or a path Swift intends to continue down.“I have no idea what will come next,” she writes in the album’s prologue. Not everything here works, but taken together Folklore and Evermore make a convincing case for Swift’s ability to shift shape and for her songs’ ability to travel between genres: as lockdown overachievements go, it’s pretty impressive.Daniel Barenboim spent lockdown earlier this year practising the piano. One of the fruits of that intensive work has been his fifth complete recording of the Beethoven sonatas, together with the Diabelli Variations, which appeared in October. But Barenboim had already begun to revisit Beethoven for this year’s anniversary 12 months ago, when he performed the piano trios in two concerts in Berlin, with his violinist son Michael and the cellist Kian Soltani, both former members of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra. Whether these new discs are taken directly from those live performances isn’t clear, but they were certainly recorded in the same venue, the Pierre Boulez Saal.The numbering of Beethoven’s piano trios is confused, but there are seven works included in this set – the three that Beethoven designated as his official Op 1, the two works of Op 70, the first of them known as the Ghost Trio, and the Archduke Trio, Op 97, as well as the curious Kakadu Variations, with their deceptively late opus number, Op 121a. It’s exactly 50 years since Barenboim recorded these works with his first wife, the cellist Jacqueline du Pré, and the violinist Pinchas Zukerman, performances that have become classics because of their energy, enthusiasm and brilliance, irresistible qualities that easily outweigh the lack of subtlety in some of the playing.The new set is very different – more thoughtful, objective, and more nuanced than before, though no less brilliant when required. It’s not mentioned in the sleeve notes, but the crisp transparency of the sound of the piano’s upper register suggests that Barenboim is playing the instrument he had built to his own specification a few years ago only a few passages, in the Kakadu Variations particularly, seem a little piano-heavy. Even in the slow movements of the Op 1 trios there are moments of genuine depth and introspection that seem to take the music well beyond 18th-century classicism, and it’s very often Soltani’s cello playing that leads the way, as it also does towards the otherworldly ending of the Archduke’s theme and variations. But all of these performances contain moments to cherish, even when they may not quite convince as a whole.A brief mention for a new disc of Beethoven’s “other” piano trios, for piano, clarinet and cello, Op 11 and Op 38, which are brought together on a disc on the Paraty label from Filipe Pinto-Ribeiro, Pascal Moraguès and Adrian Brendel. Neither trio is especially profound – the six movements of Op 38 are Beethoven’s own reworking of his Op 20 Septet – but with Moraguès’s clarinet very much to the fore, these players invest both works with every bit of the elegance and feeling they need.History suggests that critics should consider treading carefully when it comes to McCartney III. Its two predecessors, 1970’s McCartney and 1980’s McCartney II, were greeted with widespread horror: it’s a close-run thing, but they may be the worst-reviewed albums of Paul McCartney’s entire career.Reeling in disbelief that the architect of She’s Leaving Home and Hey Jude could offer up something so ramshackle as his solo debut, the Melody Maker suggested the former’s contents were both “sheer banality” and evidence that the really talented one in the Beatles was George Martin. McCartney II fared even worse: “electronic junk … crude … torture” offered one contemporaneous review, while another suggested that McCartney had “shamed himself” by releasing it.Today, McCartney and McCartney II are two of the most revered albums in their author’s solo catalogue, moments where he temporarily forgot his commercial impulses – but not his innate gift for melody – and allowed his more experimental side free rein. One school of thought has the ragged, home-recorded McCartney as the forebear of the alt-rock subgenre that came to be known as lo-fi the synth-heavy McCartney II has been rediscovered by DJs and hailed as presaging electronic bedroom pop.The disparity between the initial reviews and their later standing suggests that McCartney’s one-man-band solo albums only reveal their true glory in the fullness of time, an idea that whirls around your head when you’re confronted with McCartney III’s Lavatory Lil. A jaunty excoriation of a gold-digger, the best thing you can say about it is that it isn’t quite as awful as its title leads you to fear. There’s always the chance that, by the middle of the century it’ll be claimed as the worthy descendent of the Beatles’ Polythene Pam, or the version of the ribald Liverpool folksong Maggie Mae that snuck on to Let It Be, but that feels a stretch: it’s not as weird or funny as the former and nor does it have the latter’s sense of history, Maggie Mae being a song the pre-Beatles skiffle band the Quarrymen used to perform. In fact, it feels more like a successor to the interminable joke track Bogey Music, one bit of McCartney II that not even the nuttiest Macca fan has attempted to reassess.If Lavatory Lil is a moment where the process behind McCartney III – recorded in lockdown, with its author in charge of everything – has led to a self-indulgent lapse of judgment, the rest of the album finds him letting his guard down in far more appealing ways. A certain freedom is evident in opener Long Tailed Winter Bird, a lovely instrumental that’s allowed far more room to breathe than you suspect McCartney in more commercially minded mood would permit. He might also have balked at releasing Slidin’ on the grounds that it was too obviously a homage to Queens of the Stone Age, albeit one laced with an infectious sense that its author is having a high old time.Deep Deep Feeling, meanwhile, may be the best song to bear McCartney’s name in more than a decade. Its melodies slowly entwine and uncoil over eight minutes involving lengthy instrumental passages, falsetto vocals, shifts in tempo, a Mellotron-esque synth that recalls the opening of Strawberry Fields Forever (as with Winter BirdWhen Winter Comes’ nod to the bucolic atmosphere of 1971’s Ram, it’s the kind of musical self-reference that never seems accidental on a McCartney album) and an acoustic coda. The lyrical examination of emotional extremes feels authentically confessional. Similarly personal, if more oblique, Pretty Boys puts the audibly aged aspect of his voice to use, quaveringly describing its titular subject as “a line of bicycles for hire, objects of desire … a row of cottages for rent for your main event”.It’s moving because he knows of what he speaks. This isn’t a superannuated rocker sneering at latter-day manufactured pop bands, but something fonder and more personal: a man knocking on 80 who was the subject of teen hysteria a lifetime ago, who gave up playing live because he couldn’t hear himself over the screaming. Seize the Day features the prickly, defensive McCartney of Silly Love Songs – “it’s still all right to be nice,” he protests, a sentiment that gains heft in a world of snarling binary isions – set to a melody that’s almost preposterously McCartney-esque, navigating its twists and turns without appearing to break a sweat. Related: \u0027I was shattered\u0027 – Paul Weller, Booker T and more on the day the Beatles split There are moments of filler – Deep Down’s vaguely R\u0026ampB-ish groove rambles a little – but this is the most straightforwardly enjoyable and certainly the most personal McCartney album since 2005’s haunted, twilit Chaos and Creation in the Backyard. As to whether it joins Volumes I and II in the pantheon of undisputed solo McCartney classics, time will tell: as the afterlife of its predecessors demonstrates, the future is hard to predict.• McCartney III is released on 18 December.Robin Guthrie and Harold Budd: Very Slender HomageFrom the album released a week before Budd’s death, Another Flower, an appropriately titled sliver of delicate beauty.And so it is Christmas. Here’s what Burd Ellen have done: made a brilliant set of wintersongs from all across Britain that almost hovers in the air like an eerie snowglobe of sound. It begins with two minutes of buzzing drones, bowed cymbals, violin string scrapes, and distant murmurations of birdsong, setting a stage of pure ice and pitch blackness. Debbie Armour enters singing folk revival classic Please to See the King and when Gayle Brogan joins her in harmony, their Scottish voices mist together almost viscously.Burd Ellen was once Armour alone, a singer who has collaborated with Scottish giants Alasdair Roberts and Frankie Armstrong. She explored women’s narratives in folk song on 2018 debut album, Silver Came. Brogan brings to the mix 20 years spent making unnerving electronic music as Pefkin (her recent anthology on Bandcamp, The Crows \u0026amp Gossip Among the Leaves, comes highly recommended) plus a shivering zither and synthesisers (including the fittingly named Dark Energy).Well-known songs have their lyrics highlighted in illuminating ways throughout. Coventry Carol’s tale of the “little tiny child” and Herod’s advance moves with a menacing slowness against a low, shuddering murmur. The metaphysical strangeness of the Corpus Christi Carol, revived by Jeff Buckley on 1994’s Grace, fittingly builds then distorts, before unwinding into a coda of piano and guitars that recalls Talk Talk’s Laughing Stock.Softer moments do alleviate the terror: the a cappella Sans Day Carol from Cornwall is even sweet enough to accompany a Christmas morning’s buck’s fizz. Keep the convulsing black metal intro to Tàladh Chriosda (Christ’s Lullaby) for setting your brandy pudding alight, however.Since she first pricked up ears with her impish flow and shadowy beats four years ago, 28-year-old south Londoner Flohio has always given the impression of being an outsider in the UK’s rap movement. Her route to fame has, rather unusually, been through left-field electronica. She appears to address this on her new mixtape (which is essentially a debut album) with Roundtown, on which she sings: “I’ve been around town For a second, going ham now See me rollin’, tryna get my balance right.”No Panic No Pain certainly suggests she’s found her lane: it’s a seething statement of intent, with her jugular-chopping, sometimes sullen delivery set to sinister, cavernous instrumentals and the familiar eerie synths of 70s horror films. Tracks such as Boobytraps, With Ease and the Cadenza-produced Sweet Flaws barely let up. The result risks being oppressive, Flohio’s staccato flow smacking like heavy rain, but there are less antsy moments too, as on Flash, where she boasts of being reckless against a stunning fluoro backdrop that rushes like a video game.She sounds less confident on the songs outside her heated comfort zone, which is unfortunate in a rap game obsessed with versatility. But, as Flohio says on Unveiled, her mode is “more hype, more rage”. That singular vision is finally paying off.For my money, London-born Gabriel Latchin is the best straight-ahead jazz pianist to appear in the past few years. Polished technique we now take as normal, but there’s a particular crispness in his playing and a lucidity that grips the attention. I was a bit taken aback to learn that Latchin was about to release a Christmas album, but this is no festive quickie. As he points out in the CD notes, the best Christmas songs were mostly the work of American songwriters of the 1930s and 40s, who also produced many of the tunes which are now jazz standards. Perhaps, he thought, it was time to give them the jazz treatment too. And while he was about it, why not give each a flavour of one of his own favourite pianists? So we have the title number with a touch of Bill Evans, and others giving a nod to Ahmad Jamal, Barry Harris etc. Latchin leaves us to guess most of them. Thelonious Monk is easy, and Herbie Hancock after that I’m not so sure. But all 11 tracks are a delight to listen to anyway, and not just at Christmas. Brandee Younger is a classically trained harp player who you may have heard guesting with the likes of Lauryn Hill, Common, Drake and the Roots. Under her own auspices, she has been developing a jazz vocabulary for the harp, building on the achievements of Adele Girard, Dorothy Ashby, Alice Coltrane and Zeena Parkins. As well as being an instrument dominated by women (Younger’s latterday peers include Laura Perrudin, Alina Bzhezhinska, Destiny Muhammad, Rachael Gladwin and Carol Robbins) the harp is notoriously difficult for non-harpists to write for, and its music has developed largely through the experimentation of its practitioners, who are able to exploit its unique melodic characteristics and variable decay times.Younger has recorded several albums fronting her own quartet but it is in spartan settings that you really appreciate her technique and harmonic intelligence. Force Majeure was recorded in the New York home she shares with her husband, the bassist and producer Dezron Douglas, and follows on from duets that the couple livestreamed each Friday morning under lockdown. The harp and the double bass make great sonic partners: they reinforce each other through shared resonance, and Douglas’s serpentine, busy bass lines often sound like extensions of Younger’s harp.For all the slapdash presentation and between-song banter, this is a delightful piece of chamber music. Modal jazz classics by Pharoah Sanders and the Coltranes rub shoulders with heavenly, harmonically rich readings of soul standards such as You Make Me Feel Brand New by the Stylistics and Clifton Davis’s Never Can Say Goodbye, with Younger lurching from modal flourishes to the more chromatic, bop-influenced improvisations of Dorothy Ashby. On Kate Bush’s This Woman’s Work, Younger’s tumbling phrases sound like an African kora on originals such as Toilet Paper Romance, she shimmers like an entire string section.Hawaii Hawaii Hawaii (Birmingham Record CompanyNMC) is an album of compositions by Joe Cutler, the centrepiece of which is a three-part saxophone concerto featuring Trish Clowes. Part one is a piece of quizzical, fin-de-siècle romanticism part two a cartoonish riot part three a nightmarish slab of dystopian science-fiction, where Clowes’s tenor sax seems to serve as the sole representative of humanity.In a Word is part of a series of “intergenerational” collaborations on the FRKWYS label, here featuring 78-year-old American post-minimalist composer Daniel Lentz and 39-year-old Canadian artist Ian William Craig. The standout moments see Craig’s androgynous, ghostly voice flutter over Lentz’s slowly mutating, Harold Budd-like piano phrases, all the time being artfully distressed by tape manipulation.Bristol-based film composer Alexandra Hamilton-Ayres releases 2 Years Stranger (Manners McDade) an album written during an extended period of grieving. It’s based around funereal phrases played on a clunky upright piano, which are slowly orchestrated using burbling synths, washes of white noise and spartan, icy string orchestrations, all to devastating emotional effect.For most chamber music partners, 2020 has been a year of jarring discontinuity, but for a few – those with a spare room, no family commitments and the ability to tolerate the incorrect loading of the dishwasher – there have been silver linings. In Rotterdam in March the pianist Sam Armstrong moved in with his soprano recital partner Katharine Dain for what they thought would be a few weeks of quarantine and rehearsal. Those weeks turned into months, in which they worked daily on a selection of French-language songs written in life-changing times. The result, recorded in August, is an extraordinarily polished and thought-through disc.At its centre is a glowing performance of Messiaen’s 1937 song cycle Poèmes pour Mi, Dain’s voice crystalline yet powerful when required, Armstrong’s piano effortlessly propulsive. Surrounding this, in pleasing symmetry, are works by four other composers. At the beginning and end are two striking songs by Kaija Saariaho: 2002’s Parfum de l’instant, the piano creating a sense of large-scale, almost tectonic motion, and 1986’s Il pleut, in which Armstrong’s contribution is to pick out a descending chromatic scale that goes from the very top of the keyboard to the very bottom, a hypnotising effect. There are two memorably melodic songs by Dutilleux, from one of which the disc takes its name, and Debussy’s early Proses Lyriques, full of Romantic sweep.It’s the two songs that frame the Messiaen that are the most intriguing. They are by “Mi” herself: Claire Delbos, Messiaen’s first wife, a violinist and composer silenced when in 1949 she suffered memory loss after an operation she died of cerebral atrophy in a care home, a decade later. Her song cycle L’âme en bourgeon (The Budding Soul), composed when she was pregnant with their only child, sets words by her poet mother-in-law, written when pregnant with Messiaen. Not a note is wasted in the two dark, concentrated little songs that Dain and Armstrong choose to include. In fact, ideally this disc would include more Delbos – but I’m not sure what I’d sacrifice to make room.Slavonic Reflections (Pentatone) captures the elusive Russian pianist Nelly Akopian-Tamarina live in a Wigmore Hall recital in 2009, and it’s just as riveting as the Brahms disc she released three years ago. The intensity and inward focus she brings to her programme of Chopin mazurkas, Janáček’s In the Mists and short pieces by Medtner and Liadov makes the whole thing spellbinding.Grammy-nominated for her work with Ariana Grande, Texan Tayla Parx is best known for her songwriting for other people. Increasingly, though, she looks poised to ascend as a solo artist in her own right. Coping Mechanisms follows suit sonically from her plush, bright 2019 debut, We Need to Talk, albeit a little more jaded tonally. Through pop, indie, R\u0026ampB, dance and hip-hop it explores the aftermath of a bitter breakup (“I know I shouldn’t say this, but I hope you’re so fucking sad,” Parx sweetly intones on opener Sad). Her voice bounces fluidly between formidable anthemic singing and choppy bars (closing track Y Know is a slick showcase of both).Other standouts include the luxe bassline of Dance Alone, the dynamic rhythms of Bricks, and rippling banger System, which finds her partying through the pain. Justified is a striking power ballad, contemplating whether she really wants the relationship to end Parx’s silky vocal is beautiful as she admits that, with enough attention, her partner could cut their fork in the road with a knife. All polished production, deft instrumentation and resonant lyrics, it’s an impressive, fun addition to the breakup album canon. Sinister and grandiose, hectic and bucolic, Norfolk producer Luke Abbott’s third album accretes big sense impressions from some wildly disparate sources. Somehow in Translate, his first solo artist album in six years and third overall, you find echoes of Boards of Canada and Dario Argento horror film soundtracks, of the beatific glide of Kraftwerk and the cold beauty of systems music: all this and sylph-like tunes too. Abbott has a jazz sideline – Szun Waves – and composes film music here, you can hear the latter but not the former.Having built a “speaker-henge” in order to achieve the cosmic wraparound sound he was after in the studio, Abbott says he hopes to be able to tour this lush, cavernous record in full quadrophonic effect after the pandemic. Fingers crossed he will, because tracks such as Earthship pair three-dimensional modular synth progressions with creepy found sounds, while others, like Living Dust, muster skitters and wub-wub to generative and strangely meditative ends. River Flow, meanwhile, conveys the ache of classical strings, and Feed Me Shapes ships in actual guitars for a finishing Velvet Underground touch. Bravo. If you’re fresh to the news that the second instalment in Neil Young’s epochal archive striptease is finally upon us, it’s already too late. The 3,000 copies of this £210 box set – 10 CDs, some not-even-bootlegged rarities, all originally slated for reveal in 2014 – have already found homes in homes other than yours.Young has said another run will follow, due to ship in March. But like its predecessor, Archives Vol I: 1963-1972, released 11 long years ago, Archives Vol II: 1972-1976 will be available to stream on this maverick artist’s own subscription channel, Neil Young Archives.Drilling down into these chronologically themed outtakes and ephemeral sweetmeats is made marginally easier by the fact that three of the box’s constituent discs are already in the public domain. The mostly live Tuscaloosa was released in 2019, preceded by Roxy: Tonight’s the Night Live (2018) and followed by this June’s Homegrown, a studio album recorded between 1974 and 1975 and so candid that it was sat on for an entire lifetime. The final disc splices together two sets of live performances from 1976 from Tokyo’s Budokan and London’s Hammersmith Odeon both have been heavily bootlegged, if never officially sanctioned.Those seeking Young’s live jams, guitar duels, onstage banter and moist communion could do worse than start at the end. If the 131-song tracklisting begins quietly, with a guitar and vocals studio cut, Letter from ’Nam, it climaxes with Young’s most amped history lesson, Cortez the Killer – seven-plus minutes in which he lays into the European destruction of a peaceful native American society, which may be a feat that’s secondary to the edifice of electric guitar Young himself builds along the way.On the remaining discs, several songs will sound familiar enough, because this is the Neil Young that his most ardent followers think of when they conjure up the Canadian guitarist. Here is the superstar created by After the Gold Rush and Harvest, growing dismissive of fame, trying to chart a course that could encompass myriad approaches and moods. The grunge era did much to seed a new generation with admiration for Young, and this is a Neil Young who Kurt Cobain could really relate to. “I need a crowd of people, but I can’t face them day to day,” Young confesses on a particularly atmospheric unreleased live mix of On the Beach on Disc 6.Discs 1 (1972-73) and 6 (1974) are the most replete with unreleased material, but rarities crop up regularly. Often, in this vast slew of songs, it’s the strangest that stand out.Fellow Canadian Joni Mitchell makes two surprise appearances, first as the subject of a ditty called Sweet Joni on Disc 1, and, more memorably, cutting loose with a shambolic Crazy Horse on Disc 3 on her own song, Raised on Robbery.The existence of a Young song called Goodbye Christians on the Shore was rumoured, but it remained unheard until now: a weirdly magnificent tune in 78 time whose far-eyed mysticism belies its donkey gait. A few more CDs in, a lovely version of the traditional Greensleeves arrives. Its role in Young’s vast canon? The ballad’s use of the phrase “heart of gold” is certainly a starting point.Hawaiian Sunrise\u0027s balmy hotel bar vibe almost disguises Young’s inner tussle: between his love and his artThroughout these recordings, the increasingly troubled troubadour is reeling from the toll that heroin has taken on musicians. He’s taking up once again with his most constant backing outfit Crazy Horse in the wake of the death of guitarist Danny Whitten, for whose death Young blamed himself. Although other musicians feature regularly, Young is most often locking guitars here with Whitten’s replacement, Frank “Poncho” Sampedro, who becomes pivotal to the Young mythos. Autobiography is highest in the mix, though, because Young is also in turmoil over his crumbling relationship with Carrie Snodgress, the mother of his child, Zeke, and half in, half out of the fractious Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young – laying down his bleakest work, but having some rollicking musical adventures regardless.If Disc 1 has more room for unreleased fun – a terrifically roiling live take on the sprawling Last Trip to Tulsa, a standout from Young’s self-titled debut album - Disc 6 doubles down on introspection. It’s home to Frozen Man, a previously unreleased portrait of the artist as an itinerant musician visiting Amsterdam in winter and pondering his inner void. Contrast comes from Hawaiian Sunrise, whose balmy hotel bar vibe almost disguises Young’s inner tussle: between his love and his art.Here, too, are no fewer than three takes on one song - LoveArt Blues, a deceptively breezy lope in which the hard-touring musician weighs up the perennial difficulties in maintaining a healthy love life. “My songs are all so long and my words are all so sad,” Young muses with no little wryness, alternating with harmonica and yodelling. It’s a phrase that could easily double as this collection’s subtitle.On YouTube, you can still see one of Megan Thee Stallion’s early appearances at a 2016 rap cypher in Houston. It’s a very telling performance. Twenty-one years old and still an unknown student (“Support the artists,” pleads the accompanying text, “this is only the beginning of their journey”) she’s vastly outnumbered by male counterparts who don’t seem to be taking her terribly seriously. It could be that they’re laughing and high-fiving while she performs because they’re incredulous at her skills, but it doesn’t really look that way. Yet she seems impossibly confident and self-possessed, ending her performance with the salacious, tongue-out taunt of “ahhh” that has since become her trademark. It isn’t just the benefit of hindsight that makes her seem the artist most likely to.Listening to her debut album four years on, it’s tempting to say that not much has changed. It drops with the same confidence you see in the video of her freestyling on that Houston rooftop. But then, why wouldn’t it? She ends 2020 on the cover of Time magazine, one of its 100 most influential people of the year. It caps off 12 months during which she has enjoyed viral ubiquity on TikTok thanks to a dance challenge based on her single Savage, which sold 3m copies in the US alone been granted a temporary restraining order against her record label, which she claimed were preventing her from releasing the music she wanted to created a vast storm – involving everyone from Republican congressional candidates to Russell Brand – with her Cardi B collaboration WAP, none of which harmed the single’s record-breaking commercial success delivered a speech about racism in the middle of a performance on Saturday Night Live and managed not merely to ride out the misogynistic online fallout from an incident in which she was shot, allegedly by rapper Tory Lanez, but skilfully turn it into a conversation about the protection of Black women. Related: \u0027We do what we want, for ourselves\u0027: why it\u0027s a golden age for women in rap Good News therefore has something of the victory lap about it, but its contents also highlight something basic that’s occasionally been drowned out by the hubbub of controversy and social media chatter: she’s phenomenal at what she does. The internet is filled with memes in which grumpy middle-aged hip-hop fans bemoan the state of the art in recent years, but Megan Thee Stallion is a traditionally gifted rapper: her flow crisp and punchy, her lyrics teeming with sharp and funny lines – “invest in this pussy, boy – support black business” “all them bitches scary cats, I call ’em Carole Baskin” – and shrivelling put-downs. Whatever the outcome of the forthcoming court case over the shooting incident, the opening track, Shots Fired, dispenses its own kind of justice, ripping her (unnamed) assailant to bits along with their online supporters: “They hate me, but watch my videos beatin’ their dicks.” She has a fantastic line in inviting male rappers to guest and then deftly undercutting them. “Tell her shake it, drop her friends off and take her pants off,” suggests Lil Durk on Movie. “Tell him spend it – you ain’t got no money, keep your hands off,” she counters. He responds by bragging about the cost of his jewellery. “I’m a boss,” she sniffs in response, “I could buy the same thing that my man bought.”While there are pop-facing moments here, not least the slightly too toothsome Don’t Rock Me to Sleep, it’s an album that blithely ignores a lot of prevalent trends in hip-hop: it is 11 tracks in before anyone breaks out the AutoTune, and even then it’s guest star Popcaan. Instead, its USP involves setting its author up in a lineage of classic rap artists. You lose count of the musical references to hip-hop’s past. Shots Fired is based on Notorious BIG’s Who Shot Ya?, while Girls in the Hood reworks Eazy-E’s Boyz-n-the-Hood. The production by Juicy J of Three 6 Mafia (favourites of Megan Thee Stallion’s late mother, who was also a rapper) on Freaky Girls is audibly rooted in early 90s G-funk, and the sound of Go Crazy contains a sweet nod to Naughty By Nature’s 1991 hit OPP. Related: \u0027When a woman raps, she spitting!\u0027 Megan Thee Stallion, the hot girl taking over hip-hop Other samples appear pointed in their intent. The gorgeous electric piano motif on Outside comes from Something in My Heart by Michel’le, the R\u0026ampB singer-songwriter who endured a physically abusive relationship with Dr Dre: among a variety of assaults, he once shot at her.More often they serve to demonstrate that Megan Thee Stallion’s talents are a moveable feast – she sounds as at home snarling over the minimal 80s gangsta rap of Girls in the Hood as she does with Beyoncé’s voice weaving around hers on Savage Remix. And, of course, they imply that these artists are her forebears: in its own way, that’s as ballsy as SoundCloud rappers’ penchant for dismissing hip-hop history – but, as we’ve established, confidence isn’t really an issue for Megan Thee Stallion. Time will tell whether her implication is right. For the moment, Good News is more than good enough.In the 1960s, salsa’s sprightly piano melodies, clave rhythms and syncopated percussion took off in New York, and its deeply kinetic combination became a popular form of dance music. It’s also a contentious umbrella term for a hybrid of Cuban dance styles such as the son montuno and mamba, as well as Puerto Rican bomba and the swing of Latin jazz. For Colombian producers Paulo Olarte and Sebastián Hoyos, AKA Contento, that made it ripe ground for reinterpretation. When they met at a concert given in 2011 by salsa pioneer Eddie Palmieri, they realised they shared a love for the music. Five years later, they began collaborating, meeting in their respective homes of Geneva and Barcelona, and using percussion, drum machines, keyboards and bass to produce a debut album that deftly merges Afro-Caribbean rhythms with a lo-fi take on the sun-dappled sound of Latin salsa.The duo call their music “salsapunk”: tracks such as Pelo Negro put a jittering cumbia rhythm under its nods to Led Zeppelin’s Black Dog, while Loco Por Tu Amor filters a salsa bassline through the crunchy distortion of a drum machine and trills of synth melody, as if taking a chiptune hammer to this music’s acoustic conventions. Yet the highlights come with Contento’s subtler salsa manipulations. Dale Melón steadily builds big band orchestration around Olarte and Hoyos’ nonchalant, almost singalong vocal harmonies – as if they were shouting the words over the thrum of a surrounding party – while Paso Palante provides a deeply satisfying mix of Afrobeat melody with a clave punctuation a warm embrace of diasporic influences, from Tito Puente to Fela Kuti. It is a joyful record: modernising without resorting to parody or pastiche, a vehicle of infectious positivity that embraces the varied makeup of an ineffable and enduring genre.Charles Koechlin’s huge output includes examples of almost every orchestral, instrumental and vocal genre opera is the only significant omission from a work list that runs to well over 200 opus numbers. Among that wealth of music, much of it still seriously undervalued and underperformed, there are no less than 29 works for flute, an instrument that was particularly prominent in French music around the turn of the 20th century, and for which Koechlin seems to have retained a particular fondness throughout his life.By far the most extensive of his flute works are the three collections, his Opp 98, 99 and 100, composed in 1944 under the title of Les Chants de Nectaire, 96 unaccompanied pieces altogether. Nectaire is a character in Anatole France’s novel La Révolte des Anges, an old shepherd and philosopher who entertains his friends by playing a wooden flute. Koechlin’s pieces, none lasting as long as five minutes, and most considerably shorter, are exquisite, wonderfully varied examples of his fondness for monody. Each piece is perfectly distinct and shaped, evoking a lost pastoral world that may or may not ever have existed, in music that ranges from archaic modality to intricate chromaticism and may be languorous, playful or nostalgic.I wouldn’t suggest listening to the whole of Les Chants de Nectaire in a single sitting – nearly three and a half hours of solo flute might be too much of a good thing for even the most devoted woodwind enthusiast. But sampled more judiciously the pieces are a quiet delight and it’s a measure of how they are valued by flautists that this is at least their fourth complete recording, one of them, released in 2007, by one of the greatest contemporary players, Pierre Yves Artaud. These performances by Nicola Woodward are intensely rewarding too, though, with all the suppleness, refinement and easy expressiveness such jewelled miniatures need.Between 1974 and 1994, Cabaret Voltaire made a career out of being slightly ahead of the curve. They may well have been the world’s first industrial band. Throbbing Gristle coined the genre’s name, but more than a year before they formed, Cabaret Voltaire were ensconced in a Sheffield attic, experimenting with tape cut-ups inspired by William Burroughs, looped recordings of machinery in place of rhythms and churning electronic noise. When their sound shifted in the early 80s to something more commercially palatable, involving funk, the influence of New York electro and, eventually, collaborations with Chicago house pioneer Marshall Jefferson, it presaged their home town’s unique take on dance music, which eventually produced revered techno label Warp.Conversely, the first Cabaret Voltaire album in 24 years feels oddly of the moment. The song titles reveal a band who never met a paranoid dystopian fantasy they didn’t like: Silent Command, Spread the Virus, Kneel to the Boss, The Crackdown. They – or rather Richard H Kirk, the sole remaining member – find themselves returning in an era that seems, well, very Cabaret Voltaire. Their old luridly grim presentiments about information and disinformation overload, curfews and crackdowns, surveillance and political chaos appear to have been fulfilled. At points, however, current events overshadow the contents of Shadow of Fear. Microscopic Flesh Fragment ends with a sample of a voice gloomily intoning the phrase “thousands will die” – precisely the kind of thing Cabaret Voltaire would have once have used to conjure up a scenario of unimaginable horror. Today, you hear it and think: yeah, that’s a conservative estimate.Timely or not, the existence of Shadow of Fear raises some questions. How does one member make a Cabaret Voltaire album that’s identifiably Cabaret Voltaire – rather than a solo album that uses the band’s name as a flag of convenience – without recourse to the past? It’s a conundrum that Kirk answers quite neatly. The sound of Shadows of Fear is definitely haunted by the band’s back catalogue. The beats frequently recall the primitive drum machine that powered their 1979 debut Mix-Up the dense, claustrophobic sound, heavy on spoken-word samples, has a distinct ring of their early 80s work about it. And it’s all thematically in keeping with the Cabaret Voltaire worldview: to the list of twitchy song titles above, you can now add The Power (of Their Knowledge), Be Free, Night of the Jackal and What’s Goin’ On, which slyly re-appropriates Marvin Gaye’s question and lends it a more desperate, pleading tone.But it never sounds like pastiche. Some of the freshness is circumstantial: the vocals are absent, along with Kirk’s former collaborator Stephen Mallinder, the band’s default singer technological advances mean the grimy sonic quality of old Cabaret Voltaire has gone too. Equally, Kirk is intent on pushing forward, ensuring that the hints of familiarity never come with an accompanying tang of comforting nostalgia. The music on Shadow of Fear is frequently so forceful and alive that it precludes the sensation that plagues a lot of new music by rebooted “classic” artists: you never feel like you’d be better off listening to one of their old albums.Instead, you feel actively unsettled. Universal Energy has a four-to-the-floor house beat and something approaching an acid synth line, but the whole thing feels out of whack: the beats judder very slightly, the sounds clash, muffled voices chatter in the distance, the overall effect a kind of danceable panic. What’s Goin’ On stirs in samples of Blaxploitation horns and a sound that recalls a funky wah-pedal guitar, but everything is distorted and underpinned by a relentless, machine-like beat, until it feels harsh and unremitting. The Power (of Their Knowledge) is less wilfully cluttered with sound, but no less discomfiting: underneath synths shrouded in dubby echo, it features sprawling, fuzzed-out guitar and a layer of white noise that fades in and out, both low in the mix, like something you’re overhearing rather than listening to. Related: Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras Shadow of Fear makes few concessions to user-friendliness – it’s far heavier-going than the last albums the original Cabaret Voltaire made – and for every listener who finds it a powerful, cathartic reflection of the times, there’s bound to be one who feels it’s the last thing they want to hear at the moment, life being what it is. Then again, Cabaret Voltaire were always isive: this is, after all, a band whose first public appearance ended in a brawl between horrified audience members, the band themselves and those who, in Kirk’s words, “took our side of the argument”. What it does, and does successfully, might be the hardest thing for a reformed band to pull off: it adds to their catalogue, rather than detracts from it.Released at the end of last year, Supalonely – 20-year-old New Zealander Stella Bennett’s breakthrough hit – found a new life via TikTok in March, as lockdown gripped. Like the majority of songs on this endearingly careworn debut, it manages to be both breezy and broken, with Bennett softly cooing “I’m a sad girl, in this big world” over a wheezy take on disco.Keen to avoid being “that TikTok artist”, Bennett followed Supalonely with the weirder Snail, a bouncy electro-pop opus about her favourite gastropod. Her restlessness also manifests itself in the various genres the album careers between: the gorgeous, soft-focus opener Happen to Me, which explores the anxiety of overthinking, leans into woozy alt-rock Kool is louche hip-hop interrupted by big, crunchy rock riffs, while the Grimes-assisted Sheesh tackles 90s house.The genre-hopping enhances the album’s patchwork quality, but it’s let down at times by Bennett’s nonchalant delivery when the tempo drops. If I Get to Meet You melts away in a smear of slurred vocals, while the breathy A Little While feels too mannered. Much better is the closer C U, a luminous acoustic ballad. “I’ll see you,” she sighs, perhaps to an old, pre-fame life, “I have to be somewhere else.”By now, most Gillian Welch fans will be aware of the generous dumps of unreleased material that have been under way since August. Having recorded dozens of songs one weekend in 2002 to fulfil a publishing contract, Nashville-based singer-songwriter Welch and her partner, David Rawlings, sat on the tapes for years.In March of this year, when a hurricane tore a hole in the roof of their studio and the pair scrambled to rescue their life’s work, they realised they felt strongly about the songs after all. After Volumes 1 and 2, here are 17 more fine originals and covers rooted in country-folk and old-time religion, rendered acoustically as a duo (that’s Rawlings on the album’s cover).Two tracks – One Little Song and Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor – made it on to 2003’s Soul Journey with gussied-up arrangements. The remainder are excellent though, prompting the question of how the duo could have dismissed songs as assured as these. Standouts include a hard-hitting Peace in the Valley, conveying anger and fellow-feeling through the intertwining of the pair’s guitars, and the almost danceable Changing Ground, on which Welch’s measured voice quavers just a little: seismic abandon, for this master of quality control. Suite Pour l’Invisible and Take the Thorn, Leave the Rose feature gorgeous slowcore jazz guitar lines reminiscent of Tortoise at their slowest or noughties Kranky labelmates Labradford, while standout track Camille brings in a drum machine over a Julia Holter-style pop-ambient vocal line to spectacular effect. The drum machine’s dinky shuffle recalls Timmy Thomas’s R\u0026ampB ballad Why Can’t We Live Together or outsider gospel singer Otis G Johnson, where lo-fi ersatz percussion creates a ghostly mirrorworld.Roxanne has said that her intersex identity informs the album. The untitled opening track examines yin and yang in overlapping voices (“these two have joined, and bound at their juncture has come a third”), and her spoken word passage on Venus wistfully ponders water, “indiscriminately merging with anything and everyone”, perhaps a metaphor for the mutability of gender. But any readings are worn lightly, and by letting other lyrics hover at the edge of imperceptibility or melt into wordlessness, she gives the listener the materials to build their own psychic space. Minus the blandly pretty chimes of an instrumental entitled ---, this is a magical record, one that instils a mindful awareness of your body while also taking you utterly outside of it.Lucia Cadotsch’s 2016 debut Speak Low unveiled the young Swiss musician’s unusual proposition, singing the classics with spellbindingly impassive purity alongside two wayward Swedish free-improvisers. Her follow-up is even more startling, primarily for the moment where Cadotsch elides two songs written more than 30 years apart – one for swing fans on the brink of the second world war, the other born out of early 1970s psychedelia – and makes them sound inseparable and contemporary. First she casually invigorates and dismantles 1939’s What’s New? while tenor saxist Otis Sandsjö and bassist Petter Eldh run ghostly, hollow-toned dissonances and rugged bass countermelodies around her. Then, without her partners dropping a rhythmic stitch, she segues into a carefree glide over Tony Williams’s dirgily trippy 1971 song There Comes a Time.It’s the standout of a rich collection. Cadotsch wistfully exhales the title track, a Duke Ellington original, against Sandsjö’s prodding, arrhythmic single tenor note. Johnny Mathis’s Wild Is the Wind acquires a confessional intimacy thanks to Sandsjö’s skill for producing ghostly chordal sounds from what Adolphe Sax designed as a single-note instrument Black Is the Colour of My True Love’s Hair drifts out of churchy organ chords (Kit Downes on Hammond is a quietly crucial guest presence) but soon finds the powerful Eldh thundering like a reborn Charlie Haden.Speak Low II foregrounds Cadotsch’s crystal-clear lyricism more than its predecessor without ever cramping the freedoms of her classy improvising partners. She brings a graceful accessibility to a personal and ingeniously offbeat setup.For the first 40 years of his composing career, Harrison Birtwistle wrote no major works for solo piano. There were a few miniatures, beginning with Précis, composed in 1959 for his college contemporary John Ogdon, but nothing substantial until the late 1990s, when he wrote the three-movement Harrison’s Clocks. Since then there have been two more hefty piano pieces, Gigue Machine from 2011, and the Variations from the Golden Mountain, completed three years later.They provide the focus of Nicolas Hodge’s disc, on which he has interleaved the pieces with Beethoven – the rarely played Fantasia Op 77, and the little known B minor Allegretto WoO 61, as well as the exquisite Op 126 set of Bagatelles the two composers share, Hodges says, a “rough-hewn strength”. That sinewy quality certainly emerges in his performance of Gigue Machine, whose dizzyingly intricate patterns, constantly renewing themselves and taking off in unexpected directions throughout the 15-minute piece, constitute a formidable virtuoso challenge and generate perhaps the most authentically pianistic music that Birtwistle has ever composed, which is delivered by Hodges with total authority and clarity.A Bag of Bagatelles, the title of the disc, was Birtwistle’s original title for Variations from the Golden Mountain, though he finally settled on making an explicit link to Bach’s Goldberg Variations, which together with Beethoven’s bagatelles he had been listening to before he composed the piece. Certainly the craggy, explosive quality of his variations, with their frieze of contrasting ideas linked by decaying resonances, has more affinity with Beethoven than Bach, and Hodges’ cool, unsentimental performance of the Op 126 pieces points up that connection. He adds a miniature as a coda, too – the Dance of the -gnome, designed for a child to play, with an obbligato part for a metronome, and quintessentially, unmistakably, pure Birtwistle.This year may well have been the toughest in history for a new artist to break through to mainstream success. It’s not merely the lack of gigs, festivals and club nights, or the sense of the promotional machine running at a reduced pace it’s the feeling that the year’s unprecedented upheavals prompted fans to cleave to the familiar, finding comfort in nostalgia rather than seek out the new. The list of biggest-selling albums in 2020 is packed with releases that came out last year, two years or even four decades ago.Clearly, Pa Salieu neglected to read the memo about this state of affairs. The release of his first mixtape crowns 12 months that would be remarkable by anyone’s standards. This time last year, he was the author of a handful of tracks and freestyles that had attracted plenty of YouTube views, but also plenty of peevish remarks in the comments about his alleged similarity to J Hus, another MC of Gambian descent. He was also recovering from being shot in the head in a drive-by attack outside a pub in his adopted home town of Coventry, or, as he calls it on Informa, “C-O-V, hashtag city of violence”.By his own account, the latter incident acted as a spur: his January breakout hit Frontline started a torrent of rapturously received new tracks and collaborations: one, Betty, was Radio 1’s record of the week for three weeks in a row. Along the way he has collaborated with FKA twigs and Burberry. He ends the year as Britain’s hottest new rapper, turning up on the cover of magazines that don’t generally feature rising UK hip-hop talent. On the cover of Send Them to Coventry, he appears giant-sized, reclining over a city that the album’s contents depict in terms so unsparing they make the Specials’ Concrete Jungle, their own grim ode to their home town, seem like a quaint expression of civic pride. “My name is Pa, I’m from Hillside,” opens Block Boy, “bust gun, dodge slugs, got touched, skipped death.”Salieu has pulled off his breakthrough largely through carving out a musical space entirely of his own in a crowded market. You can see where the comparisons to J Hus have come from – there’s a distinct note of Afroswing about the beats – but Salieu’s music is largely devoid of Hus’s lush melodicism. The most obviously hooky of his 2020 singles, Bang Out, which sampled Japan’s Ghosts, is absent the closest he leans to pop comes on More People, with its 80s soft-rock synths, and Energy, decked out with limber bass and vocals from UK soul singer Mahalia. Instead, he taps into the ominous atmospherics of grime and the minimalism of dancehall, the latter particularly noticeable on No Warnin’, featuring a vocal from Trinidad’s Boy Boy. On Frontline and Flip, Repeat, Auto-Tuned vocals are marooned over a bleak landscape of ghostly, high synth lines, minor chords, murky bass tones and dubby echo Betty has an insidiously catchy chorus, but it’s set against a backdrop that’s creepy and muted, the electronics churning in the distance.The overall effect is to spotlight Salieu’s voice, which is fantastic and, like the music, seems to exist in a space between genres, his delivery slipping naturally between rap flow and dancehall toast, between understatement and imposing bellow. His lyrics lurch between thoughtful considerations of his African heritage and its place in what he calls “the wild west”, and grimly unflinching reportage from the “frontline” of Hillfields. The macho swagger of the gun talk is undercut, lent a hollow, desperate tone, both by the music and his willingness to shift from boasts to sudden moments of stark clarity and introspection: “All I’ve known is patience” “I never saw my power”. Related: Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras It’s smart, original, raw and occasionally cathartic listening. Perhaps the success of a track like My Family – a raucous, unrepentantly aggressive collaboration with BackRoad Gee, another UK rapper audibly in touch with their African heritage – does have something to do with the events of the last eight months: rather than escapism, it feels like a release of pent-up emotions. But Send Them to Coventry sounds like it would have been successful at any time, regardless of extraneous circumstances: it’s too fresh and inventive to ignore.Whether she’s singing about her exes or world-shaking tragedy, or both, Ariana Grande has always been an open-book superstar. But few expected the balladeering Barbarella to release a sixth album so explicitly about bonking. Clearly she’s been having a more eventful pandemic than most, though the warped MGM strings on Positions suggest that Grande, a lifelong Judy Garland fan, is blurring Pornhub and eroto-pop fantasy.With her pleasure-seeking hubris leaving little to the imagination (well-fitting vaginas! cunnilingus!), perhaps it’s unsurprising that the production plays it fairly safe: Grande falls comfortably back on 90s-indebted, trap-speckled R\u0026ampB, her voice breathy and gleaming. She does subtly twist up genre in places too though: the title track echoes Craig David’s garage shagathon 7 Days there’s the disco-meets-new jack swing of Love Language and My Hair undercuts a deeper, neo-soul sound with playful lyrics about her famous ponytail.In some ways it’s a shame that Positions is overshadowed by all the sixty-nining: there is some proper soul-searching in Off the Table and Safety Net, duets with the Weeknd and Ty Dolla $ign respectively, and POV, her one-woman take on Brownstone. Grande laid bare may well be seen as a stopgap in her canon, using taboo to checkmate her past trauma, but it does pull off the rare feat of at least sounding effortless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21680bab9904daf865648bd77f7fe5545ebe7a3b/0_11_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d6181f8d13f5149ae857d7de4b4a069","title":"today in focus revisited a cure for insomnia podcast","story":"Like a growing number of people, Simon Parkin suffered from insomnia for years.

Gething opened by saying that the vaccine was being rolled out in Wales, but that the country was “not out of the woods yet” because of the ongoing threat.Boris Johnson claimed this morning that teachers are no more at risk of getting coronavirus than anyone else. (See 11.44am.) Responding to this on Sky News, Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, challenged the government to produce the evidence to support the claim. He also said that his union had evidence suggesting teachers are more at risk. He said:We’ve been conducting evidence gathering from employers which does indicate that teachers and staff working in schools are contracting the virus at a higher rate than other adults in the local population. So it’s just not true that schools can operate in a manner which is safe and coronavirus free unless there are tough measures in place to ensure the safety of those who are working there.The government claim that teachers are not at greater risk is supported by this Sage report (pdf), which does not take into account the impact of the new variant of the virus.In the comments BTL (below the line) some readers have been asking about a comment Matt Hancock, the health secretary, made on the Today programme this morning. In response to a question about the risk of children returning to school, he said:On the substance of the question, it is clear that children are very, very unlikely to get this disease, and that is true, as far as we can see, with the new variant, as well as the old. This is misleading because children do get coronavirus like other people. This report from the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine says children are “typically less susceptible” to infection than adults. But the latest ONS Covid infection survey, released on 24 December, said “secondary school-age children continue to have the highest percentage testing positive”.What Hancock probably meant was that children are very unlikely to get ill or seriously ill from the disease, which is true.But the claim that the suggestion that the new variant does not make a difference is more contentious. An Imperial College London study (pdf) published at the end of last week said there was evidence of under-20s being more affected by the new variant than by the old one. But the authors said they could not explain why, and that it could just be that the new variant is more infectious for everyone, but that because schools were open in November when England was in lockdown, teenagers might have been disproportionately affected.Here are some more lines from Boris Johnson’s interview for broadcasters at Chase Farm Hospital in north London this morning.The risk to teachers, and of course we will do everything we can to protect teachers, but the risk to teachers is no greater than it is to anyone else. The reasons for wanting to keep schools open I think are very, very powerful.Matt Hancock made the same claim in an interview this morning. But both ministers seems to be relying on evidence on a Sage report that does not take into account the impact of the new variant of the virus. See 10.12am.It’s very important to understand that back in March, one of the things I look back on with the greatest misgivings was the closure of primary schools because it’s so important for young people to get an education.That’s why closing primary schools is, for all of us, a last resort. That’s why we are looking at everything else we can possibly do to avoid that.I would stress schools are safe and the risk to kids is very, very small.We have the capacity, the issue is to do with supply of the vaccine. It’s not so much a manufacturing issue although that’s part of it. Each batch needs to be properly approved and quality controlled.Yesterday Boris Johnson hinted that he would have to tighten coronavirus restrictions in England shortly, but he implied that this was not yet a certainty. In an interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr he said:It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in … many parts of the country … I’m fully, fully reconciled to that. And I bet the people of this country are reconciled to that.This morning he seems to have firmed up his view stricter measures are now inevitable, he said. Speaking in an interview on a visit to Chase Farm Hospital in north London, he said: We’ve already got a lot of the country in tier 4, some of it in tier 3. What we’ve been waiting for is to see the impact of the tier 4 measures on the virus. It’s a bit unclear still at the moment.But I think, if you look at the numbers, there’s no question that we’re going to have to take tougher measures, and we’ll be announcing those in due course.I will post more from his interview shortly.The leader of Birmingham City Council has demanded a new national lockdown and the closure of all primary and special schools. Speaking on BBC WM, Ian Ward said the authority would back any headteacher who decided not to open to pupils on safety grounds. He said:At the moment I don’t know how many primary schools won’t be reopening but we will be collating that data as we go through the morning.We are advising all primary schools and special schools to carry out a risk assessment and to determine whether it’s safe to reopen for the spring term.If that risk assessment indicates it’s not safe for schools to reopen then Birmingham City Council will stand behind teaching staff in making that decision.Birmingham’s current case rate was 429 per 100,000 people for the week to December 29, a rise of 36 per cent. Neighbouring Wolverhampton has recorded 568 cases per 100,000 people.We know from London that once the new variant is in schools it will spread and then pupils will then take their virus back to the family home.So we are in a really really serious situation and the government needs to recognise that and they need to accept that in all tier 4 areas primary schools and special schools will have to close.The three biggest teaching unions in England - the NEU, the NASUWT and the NAHT - as well as three big unions representing non-teaching staff working in schools - the GMB, Unison and Unite - have put out a joint statement urging the government to “pause” the re-opening of schools while their Covid security is reviewed. It says:The government’s chaotic handling of the opening of schools has caused confusion for teachers, school staff and parents alike. Bringing all pupils back into classrooms while the rate of infection is so high is exposing education sector workers to serious risk of ill-health and could fuel the pandemic. Unions have called for a pause in the reopening of schools for anyone other than vulnerable children and children of key workers, and a move to remote learning for all while Covid-secure working arrangements are reviewed. All school staff continuing to work in schools should be given priority access to Covid-19 vaccinations. Instead of casually asserting that schools are safe, the prime minister should sit down with unions to discuss a joint approach to ensuring safe working arrangements in all schools and prioritising enabling all pupils have the equipment and access they need to receive a high standard of remote learning until the safety of them and the staff in their school can be guaranteed. Backing the initiative, Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said:The government’s own advice from Sage (pdf) makes it clear that opening schools to all pupils now risks increasing the infection rate. That’s in no-one’s interests. Instead of creating chaos for parents and exposing workers to risks, the prime minister should be talking to trade unions about what steps are needed to make sure all schools are Covid-secure.Boris Johnson has been visiting a hospital in north London today to see people being injected with the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine.You can tell the news cycle is getting back to normal after the Christmas and new year holiday because Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was all over the airwaves this morning giving interviews. Over the last year it has seemed at times as if he has never been off air. Here are the main points he was making.Whereas the old Tier 3 was able to contain the old variant, that is proving increasingly difficult in all parts of the country.We’ve acted very rapidly to put areas into tier 4 and obviously we keep that data under review all the time ... And we then act very fast. For instance, when we saw the new variant arrive, and we got the advice on the fact that it’s more contagious, we then acted within 24 hours.But the opposition parties have repeatedly argued that the UK government has been too slow in tightening restrictions. In Scotland the parliament has been recalled to hear a statement on tightening rules (something that has not happened in London, where the Commons recess has been extended until Monday next week) and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, yesterday urged Boris Johnson to impose a new national lockdown within 24 hours.This new variant is so much more easily transmitted, it’s so much more contagious. You only need to come into contact with a tiny amount of it to catch the disease. And that’s what’s made this period so much harder. It is also clear that the proportion of teachers who catch coronavirus is no higher than the rest of the population.Hancock seemed to be referring to this data, in a report (pdf) from Sage, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, that was released last week. But this paper, dated 17 December, was drafted before data emerged on the new variant of coronavirus.There is clear public health advice behind the position that we have taken and that is what people should follow because, of course, education is very important as well, especially for people’s long-term health.This is questionable. Minutes of a Sage meeting held on 22 December (pdf) show the government’s scientific advisers think it will not be able to drive the reproduction number below 1 if schools stay open. The minutes say:It is highly unlikely that measures with stringency and adherence in line with the measures in England in November (i.e. with schools open) would be sufficient to maintain R below 1 in the presence of the new variant. R would be lower with schools closed, with closure of secondary schools likely to have a greater effect than closure of primary schools ...It is not known whether measures with similar stringency and adherence as spring, with both primary and secondary schools closed, would be sufficient to bring R below 1 in the presence of the new variant. The introduction of tier 4 measures in England combined with the school holidays will be informative of the strength of measures required to control the new variant but analysis of this will not be possible until mid-January.If the NHS needs to go faster, then it will go faster. If there were two million doses a week being delivered, then the NHS would deliver at that speed. That’s the critical question, but that supply isn’t there yet, and we are working very closely with the manufacturers.We’re going to reduce the amount of bureaucracy that is needed there, and I’ve been working with the NHS on that. For instance, there’s one of the training programmes about needing to tackle terrorism. I don’t think that’s necessary, we’re going to stop that.We’ve delivered more than a million vaccines into arms already. That’s more than the rest of Europe put together. I’m really proud of how the NHS have really risen to this challenge.Nicola Sturgeon is expected to announce tougher Covid controls in Scotland later today, with her government considering plans to keep schools closed for the rest of January.The first minister asked for the Scottish parliament to be recalled for an emergency session at 2pm on Monday, after the number of Covid cases continued breaking records over the weekend, with 2,464 confirmed cases on Sunday.Sturgeon believes the new faster-spreading variant of Covid-19, B117, is largely to blame for the rise in cases, but the rate of hospitalisations has not yet reached critical levels in Scotland. There is speculation she may invoke a new stay at home order close to the national lockdown imposed in March 2020.In a thread on Twitter, she said: All decisions just now are tough, with tough impacts. Vaccines give a way out, but this new strain makes the period bet­ween now and then the most dangerous since the pandemic’s start.So the responsibility of government must be to act quickly and decisively in the national interest.Opposition leaders, who have previously attacked Sturgeon for a lack of full transparency with her decision-making, will call for Sturgeon to release the data and scientific advice underpinning any further restrictions.Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, said opposition parties should be briefed in advance of her statement so they could be properly prepared. He said:What is clear is that we need to see an acceleration of the vaccine rollout and a step change in testing.It is also clear that financial support from government has simply not been nearly sufficient to make up for the damage that lockdown measures have done to jobs, livelihoods and businesses. The SNP government must distribute additional funds to the front line now.The government’s education recovery group is also meeting today, and is thought likely to propose extending the current closure of schools to pupils from 18 January by several weeks.Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said: Shutting secondary schools and even primary schools for longer will inflict a heavy price on the future opportunities for young people who have already lost out so much. So we need to see the evidence for such a decision. We also need a full joined up plan for childcare as more people are now working than in the earlier lockdown.If we are to restrict people’s movement then we need to see what the benefit will be.Happy new year – although, “alas” (as the prime minister would say), that’s just a polite wish, and not an accurate description.On the plus side, this morning an 82-year-old dialysis patient from Oxford has become has become the first person in the world to receive Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca vaccine outside clinical trials on the day its UK rollout starts. There is a full story here.But on the minus side, Covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths are now rising sharply and the outlook for the next few weeks is very grim. Here are three recent Twitter threads that explain why.From Prof Christina Pagel, head of the clinical operational research unit at University College LondonFrom Chris Hopson, head of NHS ProvidersFrom Neil O’Brien MP, head of the Conservative party’s policy boardIn his final tweet, O’Brien says “something big” is needed. Yesterday Boris Johnson hinted that tougher lockdown measures could b e announced soon. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been giving interviews this morning, and he has in effect backed that message too. “Each week we look at all of the areas of the country to check that we are in the right position in terms of the tiers,” he said. “It is a very difficult situation in terms of the growth of the virus.”The situation in the UK has become much worse in recent weeks because of the new variant of coronavirus in circulation that is now dominant in some areas. But in an interview on the Today programme Hancock said he was “incredibly worried” about another new variant of the virus, one that has emerged in South Africa. He told the programme:I’m incredibly worried about the South African variant. That’s why we took the action that we did to restrict all flights from South Africa, and movement from South Africa, and to insist that anybody who’s been to South Africa self isolates.This is a very, very significant problem. In fact I spoke to my South African opposite number over Christmas, and one of the reasons they know they’ve got a problem is because, like us, they have an excellent genomic scientific capability, to be able to study the details of the virus. And it is even more of a problem than the UK new variant.ITV’s Robert Peston posted this on Twitter to help explain Hancock’s comment.Today the news is likely to be dominated by the ongoing uncertainty about pupils going back to school in England. And in Scotland the first minister is making an emergency statement to parliament. Here is the agenda for the day.12pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing.12.15pm: Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government’s health minister, holds a coronavirus briefing.2pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, makes an emergency statement to the Scottish parliament, which has been recalled from recess, about coronavirus.Politics Live is now doubling up as the UK coronavirus live blog and, given the way the Covid crisis eclipses everything, this will continue for the foreseeable future. But we will be covering non-Covid political stories too, and when they seem more important or more interesting, they will take precedence.Here is our global coronavirus live blog.I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all.

In a further trailblazing decision, it is giving everyone a first shot of either of those vaccines, with the second shot delayed to 12 weeks afterwards instead of the three- or four-week interval in the trials.And now it has emerged that NHS staff have permission, in limited circumstances, to mix and match the vaccines. With two different vaccines being used and supplies not guaranteed – particularly of Pfizer’s, which is in high demand around the world – the NHS in England has said people can be given a different second dose from the first, if absolutely necessary. So those who got the Pfizer jab first time around might – if supplies have run out (or if there is no record of which they had first) – be given the AstraZeneca version, says Public Health England’s Green Book for health staff on vaccine use. Scotland is following suit, although Wales says it will not.But in the US in particular, which has already been critical of the UK approach to vaccines, there is scepticism.Trials of the mix-and-match approach to boosters have not been done, although they are planned. In the New York Times, John Moore from Cornell University commented that British officials “seem to have abandoned science completely now and are just trying to guess their way out of a mess”.The New York Times article sparked a transatlantic row, with the BMJ demanding a prominent retraction of a headline suggesting vaccine mix and match was officially approved. That was “seriously misleading”, said the BMJ editor, Dr Fiona Godlee.It’s not official policy, said Dr Mary Ramsay, Public Health England’s head of immunisations. “We do not recommend mixing the Covid-19 vaccines – if your first dose is the Pfizer vaccine you should not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine for your second dose and vice versa.”But on the “extremely rare occasions” where the same vaccine is unavailable or it is unknown which jab the patient received, it is “better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all”.That and the 12-week spacing are real-world responses to an epic crisis, in an attempt to give some immunity to the rampaging new variant of the coronavirus as quickly as possible to as many people as possible.The US has had doubts about the UK approach already. Neither the US nor Europe is rushing to authorise use of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine. Both seem to be waiting for more evidence from a large trial taking place in the US. Both were also sceptical of the UK’s rush to authorise the Pfizer vaccine, although they have also now done so. The US has also approved the Moderna vaccine, designed and made in the US, with substantial funding from Operation Warp Speed. It’s a similar vaccine to Pfizer’s and will help ramp up the vaccination effort.Europe has given Pfizer’s vaccine emergency authorisation, whereas the faster procedure used by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority in the UK means that each batch must be assessed and certified as it is delivered. The same goes for Astra Zeneca’s vaccine, which is why the NHS has only 530,000 doses to use this week, out of the 4m promised.The availability of vials and syringes around the world may also hold things up. As vaccines are approved and production speeds up, there will be increasing demand for these. It is possible that other countries too may be forced into pragmatic decisions like those of the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1fd5e424295699de3fcbf3e5de6e8727b658152/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a6b517ea1474cda52190f7efd4c7e8d4","title":"take time off and move office functions online 10 ways to win at the new way of working","story":"The global pandemic has transformed work in a way many employees and executives want to maintain. So what can managers do today to ensure these different working practices remain a success in future?As each day passes, we’re constantly adjusting to the realities of our “new normal”. And in the unsettled world of work, worries about health and safety are compounded by other anxieties – with companies concerned about employee wellbeing, workplace services, and business continuity. Indeed, the need for organisations to continue operating has been one of the few constants of 2020.The good news is that new practices have evolved to keep businesses up and running and to protect employees. Here are 10 strategies and measures business leaders can implement to ensure this new way of working keeps working for everyone:1. Companies need to recognise the importance of supporting employees’ mental healthBusinesses have long known the importance of financial resilience. But this year, many have learned the importance of “emotional resilience” – something that can only be achieved by being supportive of employees’ mental health. Businesses need to acknowledge that Covid-19 has affected us all – and has caused a rise in mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Business leaders need to support employees through a variety of measures, including keeping in regular contact, focusing on work-life balance, and promoting access to support services. Above all, managers need to show understanding and flexibility.2. Guard against the emergence of a two-tier workforceSome employees may be happier to come into the office more regularly, while others might prefer heeding government advice to work from home where possible. But it’s important to guard against the emergence of an inefficient two-tiered workforce, where teamwork can be hampered by feelings of resentment.After all, work isn’t a one-size-fits-all proposition. Workplaces are erse – comprising traditional offices, call centre operations, manufacturing floors, retail locations, and more.6. Be aware of burnout Unfortunately, working from home can make people even more anxious about booking time off work. Leadership needs to stress that time off is essential and encourage employees to take time away from the office – even if that office is in their kitchen. Burnout leads to decreased productivity, so it is beneficial for both employees and employers to encourage a work-life balance.7. Employees’ working hours need to be respectedFor some employees, working from home translates into working all the time. They may feel like they need to overwork themselves to prove they’re doing a good job or simply have a hard time stopping without the ritual of leaving a physical office. Managers should emphasise that work done during normal office hours is valued, and model this behaviour by working reasonable hours themselves.8. Respect your employees’ work preferencesWhile it should go without saying that staff shouldn’t be pressured into the office against government advice, there are other reasons to remain flexible about office working. Some people are high-risk for Covid-19 or may live with someone who is. No one should be made to feel that this will impact their job security or career prospects. Equally, however, some employees who don’t have homes conducive to remote work may want to get back into the office as soon as possible. By supporting each inidual’s personal preference, business leaders demonstrate the caring and respect that leads to lasting employee loyalty.9. Safety measures beyond government requirements are a good moveSince the launch of the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite, more than 550 organisations have downloaded the apps. This includes employee readiness surveys, health and safety testing, and automated contact tracing to help businesses reduce workplace transmission of Covid-19.10. Provide the digital tools that make it easy to get work doneCovid-19 accelerated the need for digital transformation for companies across the board. This was especially true as businesses scrambled to support the abrupt transition to remote work. Employees whose companies already had digital workflows and platforms in place were able to keep working far easier than those that still relied on manual, offline processes.By delivering employees the right digital experience, business leaders can increase engagement, improve productivity, and maintain business continuity. Just as importantly, by leaning into digital transformation now, companies will be better equipped to survive and thrive during the current crisis – and whatever disruptions come next.If your business has yet to adapt a digital workflow platform to support cross-functional collaboration, now is the time.However work works right now, you can do it confidently with the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite.

Here we look at some key questions about how it will be deployed in England.Probably not. Any new vaccine use will begin cautiously, however loud the fanfare around the arrival of the OxfordAstraZeneca jab. The importance of this vaccine cannot be overestimated, because it is stored at normal fridge temperature and can be taken out and transported to care homes and wherever else it is needed very easily. But the first doses will be given at just a few hospitals “for surveillance purposes”, NHS England has said. That is just in case of any glitches, such as the allergy issue that arose when the NHS started using the PfizerBioNTech vaccine. That has now been resolved, incidentally, with guidance that people with allergy histories are fine, unless they are specifically allergic to any of the ingredients in either of the vaccines.The photo opportunities on Monday are likely to take place in Oxford hospitals, because the university invented the vaccine. But the Royal Free hospital NHS foundation trust in London, Guy’s and St Thomas’, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay, Brighton and Sussex and the George Eliot hospital NHS trust will all start using the jab on Monday. Then later in the week, GP-led vaccination centres around the country will be sent supplies. There are 700 of these in England at the moment another 180, plus 100 more hospitals, will start deploying the vaccine this week, says NHS England.Care home residents and the staff looking after them are at the top of the list, as has been the case. But this has been difficult to do so far because the Pfizer vaccine is not easy to store and transport, because of a requirement to keep it at -70C in the longer term. This time, this group can be the main focus. GPs are being offered £10 for every care home resident they can vaccinate by the end of January.Official figures from NHS England – as opposed to politicians’ pronouncements – show that about 750,000 people have been vaccinated in England in the first three weeks since the Pfizer vaccine came online, of whom 524,439 were over 80. The over-80s and NHS staff are the second priority group. Ministers say about 1 million people have received a vaccine.Hopefully, yes, because at a rate of a quarter of a million people being vaccinated each week in England, it will take all year to get through the most vulnerable – basically everyone over 50 and people with underlying health issues. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says he is aiming for 2 million a week in the UK soon and rising. There may still be hold-ups. There is enough of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine for 4 million people, but most of it is not yet in vials in its finished form and nor has it all been batch-certified, as required under the temporary emergency approval given by the UK regulator. Only 530,000 doses are ready to go into people’s arms across the UK on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63fb0931e3f9e980014368edec9fd14051c6a7c3/0_245_1991_1195/master/1991.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=123c3a2ecb8fd98f6c6546e7fc512a7f","title":"are you getting the oxfordastrazeneca coronavirus vaccine this week in the uk","story":"We’d like to speak to people who are due to be given the coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca in the coming daysBrian Pinker, an 82-year-old retired maintenance manager has become the first person in the world outside clinical trials to receive the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.We would like to hear from anyone else who received the vaccine on Monday or later this week.

Each batch needs to be properly approved and quality controlled.”In an earlier round of interviews, Hancock defended the government’s decision to keep open many schools in England, which is being defied by many councils and parents, saying closing schools was “an absolute last resort due to all the negative impacts of that decision”. It comes as a joint statement from six unions representing teachers and other school staff condemned the “chaotic handling” of the reopening of schools after Christmas, with some parents only learning what would happen with their children’s school on Sunday evening.But Hancock rejected accusations that the government was again acting too slowly to curb the spread of Covid-19, now being accelerated by the arrival of a new, more easily transmissible variant.“We have moved incredibly fast to take action when necessary, including on Boxing Day, so we don’t shy away from decisions, difficult as they are,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We have shown that we’re prepared to move incredibly quickly, within 24 hours if we think that is necessary. And we keep these things under review all the time.”Hancock indicated that one immediate move could be to shift more areas still under the previous highest level of Covid restrictions, tier 3, to tier 4, under which most shops are also closed.Asked whether the government could act within 24 hours, Hancock said: “We look at the data on a daily basis, and we can see at the moment there are significant rises, especially in the areas that are still in tier 3. But I also come back to this broader point, that it’s on all of us. The thing that stops the spread of the disease is people not coming into contact with other people. That is the sad truth of it.”Labour has called for a full national lockdown for England with immediate effect, citing the scale of increase in coronavirus case numbers, and the resultant impact in terms of hospital admissions and deaths.While Hancock accepted it was “right to say the NHS is under significant pressure”, he said this was not necessarily greater than during the first Covid peak in spring, as although numbers in hospital were greater, there was also increased capacity.Speaking shortly after an 82-year-old man became the first person in the world to receive the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine outside clinical trials, Hancock said he was “incredibly worried” about another variant of the virus, seemingly originating in South Africa, which some scientists have said could be resistant to current vaccines.In another interview with Sky News, Hancock said the use of the new vaccine marked “a real pivotal moment” in efforts to combat Covid.The government faces intense pressure over schools, with the joint statement from unions saying the current plan “is exposing education sector workers to serious risk of ill health and could fuel the pandemic”. The statement said: “The government’s chaotic handling of the opening of schools has caused confusion for teachers, school staff and parents alike.”But, speaking to Sky News, Hancock said: “It is clear that the proportion of teachers who catch coronavirus is no higher than the rest of the population. So there is clear public health advice behind the position that we take and that is what people should follow because, of course, education is very important as well, especially for people’s long-term health.”The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, told Today that tougher government action was needed. “It is very clear that the government has lost control of the virus. We’re seeing a really alarming rise in cases and in the spread of the infection,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aeee4fdf136f2c4aba2a938400c209b8eda7705/0_0_5500_3301/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9019fb3666ff9fe43b504da88b9a6d7","title":"netherlands refuses entry uk nationals non essential travel brexit coronavirus","story":"Thirteen people barred since Brexit because UK no longer exempt from EU Covid-related travel restrictions More than a dozen UK nationals have been refused entry to the Netherlands since 1 January because Britain is no longer exempt from Covid-related restrictions on non-essential travel from outside the EU since it left the bloc.A Dutch border force spokesman confirmed on Monday that up to 13 British citizens had been turned away at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport since Friday because their trips were not necessary and third-country coronavirus regulations now applied.Only a handful of countries with low coronavirus rates are exempt from EU rules barring non-essential visitors from outside the bloc and European Economic Area. The UK was removed from the list at the end of the Brexit transition period.“They all had a negative PCR test, but they forget the basic rule that it must be a necessary trip, for example for work or due to serious personal circumstances,” gendarmerie spokesman Robert van Kapel told the NOS public broadcaster.“People from safe countries are allowed to pass, but the UK is certainly not a safe country right now,” Van Kapel said. He added that some of the travellers “only wanted to visit Amsterdam”, while one man was planning to fly from Schiphol to Spain for a skiiing holiday. “That’s just not the intention now,” Van Kapel said.EU member states agreed in October to adopt a European council proposal to allow non-essential travel from a small group of countries with lower levels of Covid infections, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea.European nationals and British citizens living in the EU can still travel from the UK to the bloc with a recent negative test and proof of residence, while EU member states can in theory override the European council recommendations should they wish to.Few have, however, meaning that as long as the restrictions remain in place, British nationals can now only enter the bloc in certain cases, mainly for urgent family reasons, study, or work – including aid workers, care workers, diplomats, healthcare professionals, military personnel and transport workers.Since the end of the Brexit transition period at midnight central European time on 31 December, passengers from Britain who have a valid reason to travel to the EU must in any case also have at least six months left on their passport.They can no longer use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes, and should be prepared to show a return ticket, provide evidence that they have enough money for your stay, and have their passport stamped.Dutch border control refused about 1,900 people entry to the Netherlands last year, mainly at Schiphol but also at other airports and seaports.Most did not have proper travel documents or had too little money to stay, but about 900 – including 300 Americans – were turned away because of coronavirus restrictions introduced in March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ef317fa791d56c4af1fd0a3b1aeefd6ec808d25/0_394_5907_3544/master/5907.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f59a4967a668b9a42f51f3399413bfbb","title":"tier 5 closed schools national lockdown new covid rules england","story":"As coronavirus spreads rapidly, what are the options for the government?Pressure is building on the government to move rapidly to curb the currently rapid spread of coronavirus, with ministers indicating tougher rules for England could be imminent. So what new restrictions might be considered?This was the plan hinted at by Matt Hancock in broadcast interviews on Monday, with the health secretary noting that tier 3 areas were seeing a particularly high increase in case figures.But tier 4 goes further, also closing non-essential shops, hairdressers and other businesses, with mixing in parks limited to two people, and a bar on overnight stays away from home and overseas travel.The government has been wary of committing to a March-style England-wide lockdown, with people in effect ordered to stay at home beyond vital tasks or exercise. One option could be to introduce this regionally, billed as a tier 5. Tier 4 is already so strict that there is minimal space for additional restrictions beyond what most people would view as a lockdown.There have been reports, however, that ministers are wary of imposing overly sweeping rules on how often people can leave home, and are particularly resistant to the idea of any sort of night-time curfew, as in place in France.The return of many secondary school students, and primary pupils in high-Covid areas such as London, has already been put off for at least two weeks, with a switch to online learning. There is considerable pressure for all schools to be closed for longer, with unions demanding this and many councils where schools are supposed to reopen this week taking unilateral action.Children remain generally little-affected by coronavirus, and Hancock has pointed to statistics saying the infection rate for teachers is no higher than the national average for adults.However, the issue is primarily how much schools help spread the virus more widely in the community, with students catching the virus from each other, often with no symptoms, and then passing it to family members.With the particularly severe threat from coronavirus still focused more on older and medically vulnerable people, one option could be moving back to the system in spring whereby more than 2 million people in England were advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others.People in this group were subsequently only being advised to socially distance and take other precautions, but as cases rise there could be pressure for this to change again.Since then, people in tier 4 areas have started to receive letters warning them to not go to work, and to remain at home if possible, but there has not been any updated England-wide guidance for several weeks.Extending wearing of masksThese are already mandatory in England inside shops and on public transport and at stations, but one option could be to extend this further.In October, the British Medical Association said masks should be obligatory in all offices or other workplaces, unless people are working alone. A number of countries have made mask use compulsory on streets and in other public outdoor spaces, but this seems less likely given lower transmission rates outside."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449338.1609703493!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 teachers to seek assurances that schools are safe to reopen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCoronavirus sign on the gates of a school in Reading, England. Photograph: Steve ParsonsPA WireTeachers will seek reassurances from Government and public health officials this week that it is safe for schools to reopen as planned on January 11th, union representatives have said.Teachers union officials say their members are deeply concerned about the record numbers of Covid-19 infections being recorded and the transmission of the new variant of the virus in the community.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation, the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, and the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) want the National Public Health Emergency Team to examine school safety measures for Covid-19 given that scientists say this new variant is more infectious.The Government and the Department of Education have said they “fully intend” to reopen schools as planned from January 11th, after last week extending the Christmas school holidays by three days to allow for people’s contacts to be minimised before children return.The department said it and public health officials believe that “schools remain safe places of learning for all members of school communities”. Meetings are planned with the unions this week to discuss the reopening of schools as the number of new Covid-19 cases surges in the third wave of the disease here. Michael Gillespie, general secretary of the TUI, said teachers were “very, very concerned” about schools reopening given the “unprecedented increase in numbers” in relation to Covid-19 cases, and were “very interested” to see how the new variant is being assessed. “Schools did very, very well in the first term. We stayed ahead of the curve. We didn’t amplify the numbers, but if there was a break-out in a community, the numbers were reflected in schools, so obviously these numbers will be reflected in schools,” he said. Contact tracingContact tracing worked effectively to reduce the spread of the virus during the second wave in October, but teachers were now concerned about the effect of the new approach of not referring close contacts of positive cases for testing, Mr Gillespie added. “If they tell us that schools are safe and that contact tracing is working properly, then obviously that will help give us confidence in the system.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said on Sunday it was the Government’s “firm intention” to reopen schools as planned but that further assessments would be considered closer to the reopening.“We don’t have any advice from public health authorities that we should close schools,” he told RTÉ’s This Week radio programme.Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said he believed the Level 5 restrictions in place since Christmas and the Government’s advice that people should stay at home will reduce the rate of infection to allow schools to reopen on January 11th.“It is something we will have to review and look at but the evidence, and I think our public health advice, is that we should be able to do it,” he told Newstalk’s On The Record programme.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449688.1609759174!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"re opening of schools remains under constant review minister says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘We do want to avoid a long-scale shutdown, but we are keeping the situation under review.’ Photograph: David SleatorThe  FileThe Government wants to avoid a “long-scale shutdown” of schools and childcare facilities because it would not be beneficial for children, especially for those with special needs or in disadvantaged areas, the Minister for Children has said.Roderic O’Gorman said the situation was under constant review and\u0026nbsp Minister for Education\u0026nbspNorma Foley\u0026nbspwould be engaging with Opposition education spokespeople today, while he would be engaging with the childcare sector.The advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) had always been that schools were safe places, and the decision to delay their reopening until January 11th was part of a sustained effort to reduce movements in the community and to halt transmission of the virus, he said.“We do want to avoid a long-scale shutdown, but we are keeping the situation under review. If the public health guidance from Nphet changed at any stage, obviously Government policy would change.”As for the position of the educational sector on the vaccination priority list, the Minister said that if there were changes in the sector then that position would be reviewed.Level 5 restrictions had been introduced on December 24th and December 30th and it would take 10 to 14 days for their impact to be seen.Mr O’Gorman told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that the Government would do more if necessary but “we need to give the restrictions time to work”.A daily record of 4,962 Covid-19 cases was confirmed on Sunday, pushing overall infection numbers beyond the 100,000-mark.Mr O’Gorman defended the Government’s plan for crèches to remain open to care for the children of essential workers. When asked if there should be a second list to prioritise health care workers, Mr O’Gorman said that a second list would confuse the situation.However, he did agree that crèches should prioritise cases where the parents could not work from home.Level 5 restrictions had been introduced on December 24th and December 30th and it would take 10 to 14 days for their impact to be seen, Mr O’Gorman said. A long shut down of schools would not be good for children, he said, but the Government would keep the situation under review.Meanwhile, immunologist Professor Luke O’Neill has said that he cannot envisage schools reopening next week if the number of Covid cases continues to rise.Speaking on the Pat Kenny Show on Newstalk, he acknowledged that keeping the schools closed would be a difficult decision, but said that an extended closure might be necessary if transmission “is out of control.”“Closing the schools will have all kinds of knock-on effects, so it’s a very hard one. If we get to Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and the numbers are even higher, I can’t see the schools opening, because it’s another risk,” he said.Separately, public health expert Professor Anthony Staines has warned that reported plans not to alert all close contacts of positive cases would be counterproductive.“One of the basics of public health is the more you know about the cases you’re dealing with the better,” he told Newstalk’s Breakfast Briefing.There was also the real concern that if people were not tested, they would not be “in the system” and would not be contact traced which was really important for breaking down transmission of the disease, he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"The first test is for governments to stop subsidising fossil fuel industry which knowingly contributed to global over-heatingEvery 0.1 degree matters as the world attempts to keep within 1.5-degree rise\u0026lsquo2020 is on course to be the 10th consecutive year of above-normal temperatures\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449181.1609685790!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"level 5 restrictions must be given chance to work says varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Leo Varadkar said it was the ‘firm intention of the Government to open the schools’. Photograph: Julien BehalTánaiste Leo Varadkar has said that existing Covid-19 restrictions should be given “a chance to work” before any new restrictions, including closing schools, are considered.Mr Varadkar said there has been an “explosion of cases beyond any of our modelling” and that it was “not possible to rule out additional restrictions”.“But we have the existing restrictions a chance to work,” Mr Varadkar told RTÉ radio’s This Week programme. He said it was the “firm intention of the Government to open the schools”.“We don’t have any advice from public health authorities that we should close schools,” he added though he said there would be further assessments of the situation in the coming days.ASTI president Anne Piggott said that her members were “very, very worried” about returning to school.“We want assurances on safety in schools,” she said.Mr Varadkar also said that intensive care beds in private hospitals could be used by the public system if they are needed. Asked if there was a danger that hospitals would be overrun, Mr Varadkar said: “I wouldn’t go that far yet.” However, he said “we need to turn off the tap”.“If patients continue to be admitted at the rate they’re currently being admitted, then we will run into difficulties,” he said.Asked about delaying the second shot of the vaccine in order so that more people could avail of the initial shot, Mr Varadkar said: “That is not going to be a political decision. It would be very much guided by the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Council on that. I know that’s what they’ve decided to do in the UK, it’s what they’ve decided not to do in the US and it is a judgment call – do you give 200,000 people full protection, or do you give 400,000 people partial protection and we’re going to rely on the advice from the experts on vaccines before making a decision on that.”Asked if the Government had made the wrong decision at the end of November by opening hospitality venues, the Tánaiste said that “nobody can answer that definitively . . . perhaps the right decision would have been not to accept the Nphet advice and not go to Level 3 at all, maybe extended Level 5 for a longer period, but you can only make those decisions based on the advice and information you have at the time.”Earlier, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said the Government could reduce the limit on people’s exercising distance from 5km to 2km if Level 5 restrictions do not lower the number of Covid-19 cases sufficiently.Mr Ryan told Newstalk radio there were other measures that could be taken in addition to Level 5 restrictions such as reducing travel from 5km to 2km as happened during the first lockdown if infections did not decline.“That is for a week or two’s time if the numbers are not starting to flatten off and then decrease,” the Minister said.VaccinesHe said vaccinations should be carried out 24 hours a day, seven days a week, once the Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinations become available in Ireland. Asked to comment on criticisms that Ireland was being slow in rolling out the vaccine, Mr Ryan said the HSE had used the first few days to “test the application” and ensure people’s confidence in the rollout system. From Monday, 40,000 vaccinations will be carried per week with an initial focus on the 17,000 frontline healthcare workers and 75,000 staff and residents in long term nursing homes, he said. While the HSE previously said vaccinations would be given out on a 9 to 5, five days a week basis, Mr Ryan said vaccine services would be extended to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, once the European Medicines Agency approved the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines. Once these are available “it’s going to have to be 247 in my mind with all hands on deck”, he said. “There’s 1,700 people already been trained up to roll it out so there’s no shortage of resources, no shortage of impetus to get this out. It’s in our interest to get it delivered to as many people as quickly as possible, as safely as possible. “We’re not going to be stockpiling any vaccines. In other words, as a soon as we get them we’ll be deploying them.”On travel from the UK to Ireland, Mr Ryan said meetings would be held on Sunday to discuss the ban which is currently in place until January 6th. Further precautionary measures, such as requiring travellers to take a PCR test before leave the UK along with isolating upon arrival were being considered, he said.In the coming weeks only essential workers such as truck drivers and other haulage operators bringing vital supplies should be travelling between the UK and Ireland, said the Minister.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"public health doctors strike deferred due to surge in covid 19 cases","story":"Public health specialists have deferred a series of planned strikes which were scheduled for later this month due to the deteriorating situation regarding the Covid-19 pandemic.The doctors, who are represented by the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), said they would review the position again at the end of January.The public health specialists were scheduled to stage three three days of strikes on January 14th, 20th and 21st in a dispute over pay and contracts. The doctors have been campaigning for some time for public health to become a consultant-led service and for public health specialists to be awarded consultant contracts “to reflect their expertise and specialist skills”.Public health specialists currently earn about € 113,000. Hospital consultants with an existing type-A contract - which permits them to treat only public patients - have a pay scale that ranges from €141,026 to €195,653.The IMO’s public health committee said on Monday that given the rapid and escalating incidence of Covid 19 in Ireland and the critical role of public health specialists in controlling the virus and breaking chains of transmission, it had decided to defer the planned strike action.Dr. Ina Kelly, Chair of the IMO Public Health Committee, said the committee’s decision to defer the planned industrial action was action was “based purely on ethical considerations and our commitment to do the right thing at a time of grave crisis”“This Government has failed to do the right thing. Our careers are dedicated to public health and to even contemplate industrial action has been an extremely difficult decision yet this Government has forced us to do just that.”“We can only hope that the Government will take this time to finally recognise the importance of a consultant led service, the need to immediately upgrade current specialists and to recruit additional consultants into the service and to ensure our Departments have permanent support staff. We are doing our best but with the inaction of Government we are fighting this pandemic with too few people who are being asked to do too much.” Dr Kelly said that for all the talk from the Government on the importance of supporting public health, doctors were “more than disappointed, frustrated and angry that even now our public health departments are wholly under resourced and Government has still not even come to us with proposals to reform the system so that we can have a consultant led public health service”.“ It is nothing short of disgraceful that we are almost a year into this pandemic and have had no meaningful engagement with Government.”“This confirms to us that this Government neither respects nor values the work of public health doctors and it strengthens our resolve to win this battle in the coming months in order to protect the future of public health in Ireland. We went into this pandemic understaffed, under-resourced and under-valued and nothing has changed. We still have no consultant led public health teams and inadequate staffing and we are still overwhelmed on a daily basis.” The Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said before Christmas that he had submitted a business case to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a consultant contract for public health specialists “which would give them the recognition they deserved and lead to a significant increase in salaries”.The  understands that the Department of Health proposed in its business case to the Department of Public Expenditure that about 80 consultant posts in public health medicine be established and that these positions could be advertised early next year.It is understood that the Department of Public Expenditure sought further clarification on some issues in the business case submitted by the Department of Health.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449237.1609693865!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit truckers arrive fresh and well fed after first rosslare dunkirk sailing","story":"A new ferry service linking Rosslare Europort in Co Wexford to Dunkirk in northern France completed its first crossing on Sunday.

Photograph: Sharon Gaffney. With his lorry decked out with Irish, French and EU flags, truck driver John Carroll was among the first to alight from the maiden DFDS direct sailing from Rosslare Europort in Co Wexford to Dunkirk in northern France. The service, which is to run six times a week with each crossing taking about 24 hours, was introduced after Brexit took effect. This makes it a longer journey for hauliers but it means they do not have to make customs declarations or face additional checks and inspections crossing from Britain to the UK. It is seen by truckers as a means of avoiding ‘red tape’ issues on the UK landbridge such as the lengthy delays seen for many vehicles seeking to board ferries going England into the EU.“It was great,” said Carroll, who works for DG McArdle International, of his overnight journey. “It may have taken a bit longer, but I’ll be at my delivery point in Germany by 9pm tonight...We’re feeling well-rested and ready for the drive ahead.”Tom Bermingham was another of the 65 truckers who made the trip on the Danish shipping company’s vessel.“We’re fresh and well-fed, it was a great service,” he said. “We were wrecked before Christmas after being stuck in the chaos at Dover. We’ve avoided all the hassle of driving through the UK.”The head of the company that operates Irish Ferries, Eamon Rothwell, has insisted that businesses will continue to rely on the landbridge, which he maintains is cheaper, faster and less prone to cancellations caused by bad weather.‘Awful mess’But Eoin Gavin, who runs a transport company based in Bunratty, said he had “three trucks stranded all last week” because Irish Ferries’ services into Cherbourg were fully booked. “We’d have been in an awful mess if it hadn’t been for the direct sailings into Dunkirk.”Gavin said that in order to use the landbridge he would need to navigate six different IT systems. “Would you do all that, without taking into account Covid tests and potential delays, or just drive down to Rosslare and hop onto a direct sailing to France?” he asked. Gavin says his clients have insisted that their goods should not be transported via the landbridge. “They’re questioning why they should bother with all the extra paperwork involved. If clients refuse to provide us with the necessary invoices and declarations we have no choice but to avoid the UK.”This point is reinforced by Aidan Coffey, managing director of DFDS Seaways Ireland. “It’s not just hauliers who decide which routes the trucks should take. It’s also the manufacturers and producers who are telling drivers not to travel through the UK,” he says. “By using the landbridge, some of them risk being subject to veterinary checks, or even having their products contaminated if the trailers are opened and checked.”Added bonusAn added bonus, he says is that “direct sailings also allow drivers to take their rest periods during the 24-hour crossing, rather than when they land in France.”Daniel Deschodt, chief executive of Dunkirk Port, said the new route put Irish drivers “straight into the ‘blue banana’ as we call it in France, straight into Northern Europe”. “That compares to trucks arriving into Cherbourg, which is a six-hour drive from here. Dunkirk is just 20 minutes from the Belgian border,” he says. Seamus McKeegan, director of Co Antrim firm McKeegan International, says he is “avoiding Calais like the plague” following the backlog that faced drivers transiting from Dover in the run-up to Christmas. He says the direct sailings appear to be the best option for hauliers, but would continue to monitor the situation to see how it evolves. Signage has been installed at Dunkirk port wishing drivers ‘a céad míle fáilte’, but there was also a local man on hand to welcome the ship.

Photograph: Alan BetsonDublin Port’s first working week of 2021 got off to a smooth start on Monday – due in part to the extremely low volume of traffic arriving from Holyhead.Cars and lorries arriving from the UK passed without a hitch through the European Union’s new trade border inside the port as well as the Garda checkpoint, where Covid locator forms were also required.The first Irish Ferries vessel to dock, the 2.40am Ulysses sailing from the Welsh port which arrived in Dublin at 6am, carried just 15 articulated lorries, one truck, two vans and 15 cars, together with a related number of passengers.One of the ship’s deck hands, surveying the vast empty space with capacity for 241 lorries and 1,342 cars as the ship set sail, exclaimed cheerily: “Brexit England – nothing we can do.”This may, or may not, be the explanation for the low volume making the early crossing from the UK but Holyhead port officials, and the shipping companies, expect Irish Sea volumes to increase sharply later this week and throughout January when importers, especially supermarkets, seek to replenish their stocks.However, complying with the requirements of the EUUK trade deal, in force since January 1st, can present unexpected difficulties, as Scott McCann, owner of Event Transport Ireland Limited, and Sean Carry, his transport manager, found on Sunday.Prior to Covid striking early last year, the company provided rigging for major events but, when the virus emerged and the live entertainment industry died overnight, Mr McCann’s business had to ersify fast or die as well. Now, 10 months later, the company has eight 40 foot long articulated lorries crossing the Irish Sea daily, transporting goods for an international distribution company.With the new EUUK trade deal regulations coming into force over the weekend, Mr McCann and Mr Carry decided to stress test the system for themselves by driving a load over from England, just to see what their drivers faced.He already had Pre Boarding Notification (PBN) issued by the Irish authorities but without the companion MRN number, they would not be able to catch the early Monday morning Stena Line ferry from Holyhead to Dublin.They took a pit stop at the Holyhead McDonalds, hoping to hear from the broker that the MRN had come through.“We should have it within the hour,” Mr Carry said hopefully, having just missed the 8pm sailing.But it was not to be: as of Monday morning, both men remain stranded in Holyhead, frustrated as their predicament.More fortunate was Kaspars Ukis, the driver of an O’Toole Transport articulated lorry bringing a consignment of salads from the UK to outlets in Ireland. His papers in order, he experienced no difficulties but was anxious about Dublin Port’s capacity to cope when traffic volumes increase.So far, however, the Port’s system of streaming vehicles through the checks, where cheery customs officials waved most through without demur, while gardaí checked identities and ensured Covid tracking locator forms had been filled in, is working smoothly.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449227.1609690422!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we are down to the last penny aran islanders on their pandemic year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDara Molloy photographed at home on Inis Mór. Photograph: Tess Harper-MolloyLife on the Aran Islands breeds resilience. Following a year like no other, islanders begin 2021 filled with worries and hope, but with less in reserve if the coming year brings new troubles.Having grown up in Malahide in Co Dublin, Dara Molloy found urban life unfulfilling before he ultimately retraced the steps of his parents, who had moved from a country childhood to the city, by moving to the islands in 1985.Molloy, who was a Marist priest at the time, quickly knew he was home. In the years afterwards, he lived in a tent then in a hut. Later he left the priesthood. Today, he is married, with four children.He works as a wedding celebrant on the island and on the mainland for those seeking spiritual but non-religious ceremonies. With so many weddings on hold, last year was quiet.“I have a car outside my house I can’t reinsure. We just have no money. And it will take time because people will have to repay what they owe.”Events on the mainland eventually affect the Aran Islands. But in the startling year that was 2020, there was one striking distinction between the two, since the islands managed to remain almost entirely free of Covid-19.Just one household was affected there. During the first lockdown, islanders fretted over whether they should open ferry and plane routes to summer visitors once national restrictions lifted. In the early summer, a vote was held to gauge local feelings. The vast majority of residents – some 80 per cent – wanted to keep their area closed.“We ended up having a vote through phone messaging. I was very against that because I knew it would be isive – and it was. We all got very angry and we all took sides,” Molloy says.Tourism is crucial for many Aran islanders. But the water between them and the mainland offered a natural fortress against the virus. To many, it seemed foolhardy to invite strangers to walk among them. This led to a tense time in what is usually an easygoing society.“For me, I don’t think anyone has the right to deprive anyone else of an income. The difference here was that if the country was allowed to be opened up, then why weren’t we? We are part of Ireland.“That is how we came to be open in the end. I understand the element of fear that people had. Not everyone here is dependent on tourism. Quite a lot are, but not everyone.”A grim yearInis Mór, the main island, is definitely big enough for one ex-hermit and, it turns out, several Kiwis. Dave O\u0027Halloran\u0027s great-great-grandfather left Ulster in the 1860s to seek his fortune in the New Zealand gold rush.Now, O\u0027Halloran is one of four New Zealanders living on Inis Mór. With his wife Jenny O’Halloran, he runs a seaweed-harvesting business that was started by his father-in-law, Máirtin Concannon, in 2000. The pandemic hit them like a lightning bolt.“We are really lucky that we have a erse pantry of things we can harvest and because we only have myself and my wife employed at the time, we didn’t have to let anyone go.”Usually upbeat, O\u0027Halloran frets about the year ahead and what it will bring.Once the decision was taken to reopen the islands and visitors began to reappear in July, there was no acrimony. Some B\u0026ampBs stayed closed. So, too, did the American Bar on Inis Mór’s quayside. Only Joe Watty’s Bar and the Aran Hotel served hot meals.Unspoiled experienceTourism on the Aran Islands is decades-established. Its profile is changing, with the wifi signal now enviable. Glamping is now available, too, yet the Aran experience has somehow remained unspoiled.If anything, visiting feels like an escape, an opportunity to step back. This year, a strange thing happened. With international tourism obliterated, Irish visitors returned to the Aran Islands in volumes not seen since the late 1970s.“The facilities aren’t really here for that. But I think people were surprised by how much they enjoyed the experience here. I personally think there is a spirit here you can kind of feel. It is a good place with good people.”O’Malley owns and runs Joe Watty’s, located five minutes’ walk from the Inis Mór pier, with her husband, PJ Flaherty. High season meant 13-hour days and seven-day weeks. The bar is now closed, amid the latest coronavirus restrictions.With 19 staff, she was nervous of the virus. However, demand from visitors was constant. On long fine evenings, holiday-makers stood in line outside for hours waiting for a table. A fortune could have been made ferrying out drinks, but they stuck religiously to the Covid-19 rules.Leaving people waiting so long went against O’Malley’s hospitality instincts, but everyone got fed. Every venue lacked live music, too, an abnormality on the island. But sticking by the rules kept the virus at bay, she believes.“For bed and breakfast owners, generally speaking, this was their home they were opening up, which must have been very difficult. But I think they were just scrupulous about the rules,” she says.“The gardaí were in frequently to us. We got one phone call one time saying that someone who ate on the deck one Sunday tested positive later. That was it.”By 4pm the winter light is dipping and the Christmas lights twinkle. What comes in 2021 is an unwritten book, but O’Malley believes the pandemic, no matter when it ends, has permanently changed lives.“I feel it will never be the same again in my working life . . . We used to do a lot of groups from America, France, Australia. That will be slow to return,” she says.“This has turned the whole world on its head. The Irish we had this year were wonderful. If that is sustained, it would be great. If we can return to music sessions, even better. But I haven’t a clue how it will pan out.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Northern Ireland secretary could detract from Blair statement of regret, officials feared-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449686.1609760176!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"julian assange cannot be extradited from uk to us judge rules","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJulian Assange: has been held in high security Belmarsh prison since he was carried out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Photograph:  Victoria JonesPA WireWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has won his fight to avoid extradition to the United States.District judge Vanessa Baraitser said at the Old Bailey on Monday that, due to the real risk of suicide, the 49-year-old should not be extradited by “reason of mental health”.Assange, who sat in the dock of court 2 in a blue suit and wearing a green face mask below his nose, closed his eyes as the judge read out her ruling.He is not expected to be freed from high-security Belmarsh Prison immediately as the US government are likely to appeal, but he can make a fresh application for bail.Assange is wanted to face an 18-count indictment, alleging a plot to hack computers and a conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information.The case followed WikiLeaks’s publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents in 2010 and 2011 relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, as well as diplomatic cables.Prosecutors say Assange helped US defence analyst Chelsea Manning breach the Espionage Act in unlawfully obtaining material, was complicit in hacking by others, and published classified information that put the lives of US informants in danger.Assange denies plotting with Ms Manning to crack an encrypted password on US department of defence computers and says there is no evidence that anyone’s safety was put at risk.His legal team argued that the prosecution is political and said Assange, who has been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome and severe depression, is a high suicide risk if he is extradited.In her judgment, Judge Baraitser referred to evidence of Assange’s mental state.She said that “facing conditions of near total isolation” in US custody, she was satisfied that authorities there would not be able to prevent Assange from “finding a way to commit suicide”.Assange’s lawyers had said he faced up to 175 years in jail if convicted, although the US government said the sentence was more likely to be between four and six years.Assange wiped his brow after the decision was announced while his fiancee, Stella Moris, with whom he has two young sons, wept.She was embraced by WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson, who sat next to her in court as the judgment was delivered.The prosecution has given notice of appealing over the decision and has 14 days to lodge its grounds.In her ruling, the judge rejected the defence arguments of freedom of speech and that the prosecution was politically motivated.She said: “If the allegations are proved then the agreement with Ms Manning and other groups of computer hackers took him outside any role of investigative journalism.“He was acting to further the overall objective of WikiLeaks to obtain protected information by hacking, if necessary.”The judge said Assange’s dealings with Ms Manning “went beyond the mere encouragement of a journalist”.She said Assange was “well aware” of the danger to informants by disclosing unredacted names in leaked documents.If Assange’s conduct was proved it would amount to offences in this jurisdiction and he would not be protected by freedom of speech, she said.The judge added: “Free speech rights don’t provide unfettered discretion for some, like Mr Assange, to decide the fate of others.”On the claim that the charges were politically motivated, she said: “There was insufficient evidence to find the prosecutors responsible for bringing these charges were pressurised by the Trump administration.“There is little or no evidence to indicate hostility by President Trump to Mr Assange or WikiLeaks.”She added: “I accepted Mr Assange has political opinions. However, I was satisfied that the federal prosecutors who acted to bring these charges did so in good faith.” – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"boris must bold go history pm lost union","story":"Boris Johnson does not want to be remembered as the man who won back British sovereignty from Brussels, only to lose the British nation itself. Yet this is the fate he risks unless he takes a bold approach to saving the Union. Just over six years ago, Scotland came close to voting for separation. Since then, our leaders might have asked searching questions about our constitution and the cultural, institutional and political reasons for the growing estrangement between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Instead, in a state of panic, they offered more devolved powers, and then ignored the problem altogether.Now the consequences of this inattention are becoming clearer. In the Holyrood elections in May, the Scottish National Party will almost certainly win a majority of seats, and perhaps a majority of the vote. Polls show that most Scots favour secession, and nationalism is most popular among younger voters. The future, Nicola Sturgeon believes, is hers.But all is not yet lost. Nationalists know that support for separation might yet recede. Brexit – held as a reason why Scotland might want to go its own way – in fact makes secession more complex. The old questions for the Nationalists – not least about the currency and border – are still unanswered. And while Scottish voters will not take kindly to the PM refusing to hold another referendum, as he did yesterday, neither will they appreciate an unseemly Nationalist rush for a second vote during a pandemic. Behind the scenes in Whitehall, work is underway as ministers ponder what they can do for Scotland. MPs from across the political spectrum are anxiously discussing what can be done to save the Union. There is talk of yet more devolution, and even a constitutional convention. Still unclear, however, is what the Government actually thinks.The Prime Minister was criticised for his comment that Scottish devolution had been “a disaster”, but he was quite correct. Devolution has misaligned power and accountability, allowing Scottish ministers to claim the credit for successes while escaping scrutiny for their failures. This helps to explain what one Scottish writer calls the “Sturgeon paradox”: the worse she does, especially on education and health, the more popular she becomes. Devolution has allowed the Nationalists to use the Scottish state to attack the Union. The school curriculum, for example, has been manipulated grotesquely to indoctrinate voters of the future. As Gordon Brown, the politician behind Scottish devolution in 1998, has admitted, “It was naive not to anticipate that devolution could create a megaphone for intensifying resentment.”But it was also naive to think that devolution would not cause a dangerous constitutional imbalance. The famous West Lothian Question – which asks why Scottish MPs should have a say on English matters when English MPs have no say over such matters in Scotland – remains unanswered because it is unanswerable. English votes on English laws, the fix provided by the Cameron government, fails to answer the question and creates new problems. By saying legislation applying only to England must have a majority among English MPs as well as the Commons overall, EVEL, as it is known, creates two classes of MP, and makes it harder, perhaps impossible, for an MP from a Scottish constituency to become Chancellor or Prime Minister. It also sets up an inevitable future constitutional crisis: a government elected with a UK majority but no English majority would be unable to govern England and would, for many voters, lack the legitimacy to do so too.So devolution is a disaster for all these reasons and one more: the powers it grants to the Scottish government are clearly insufficient for most Scottish voters. But what can be done? First, the Government must break the cycle of devolving in a panic. Ministers must be clear that they want to reform the constitution because they understand the urgent need to do so, not because they are appeasing nationalists out of fear. And second, their approach must be guided by principle: decentralisation, not devolution, and equality, not disparity, between the four nations.This means moving quickly to a fully-fledged federal model, with a government and parliament for each of the four nations, and a federal government and parliament residing in Westminster. Core functions – foreign policy, defence, international trade and aid, national security, immigration and border control, citizenship, extradition, monetary policy, the constitution and the maintenance of the UK single market – would rest with the federal government. Everything else, including almost all tax policies, would be the responsibility of the four national governments and parliaments.There will be many arguments against this course of action. Constitutional reform is always treated as an inconvenient distraction, but as Brexit shows, where power resides matters. Some worry that England is too big for a federal structure, but if that logic were true, it would be too big for the Union itself. A federal system could anyway still weight constituencies to give a stronger voice to the smaller nations, and would make it more likely than now that a Scottish politician can become Prime Minister.Nobody should be under any illusions of the radicalism of this kind of change. It would require new constitutional laws, and a new role for the Supreme Court. It would almost certainly herald further constitutional change, with the House of Lords replaced at last. But it would bring power closer to the people. It would put right the dangerous imbalances in the way we are governed. It would avoid the kind of constitutional crises that are heading our way. And instead of yet more piecemeal and self-defeating devolution, it would be a self-confident and comprehensive offer to the people of Scotland. For that is what is now necessary. The PM should recall the wise conservative insight that if we value something and want to keep it, we must be prepared to change it. If he values the Union, and wants to avoid the wrong place in history, the change must be great.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british citizens left stranded airlines post brexit eu residency","story":"Britons living in EU countries have been barred from returning to them after Christmas in a post-Brexit row over residency.The problems spiralled when airlines also started refusing to fly resident Britons back to Spain or Italy without the new post-Brexit foreign identity card.

Emmanuel Macron just had to mention Brexit in his traditional television New Year address to the nation. It was “born of many lies and false promises”, he said. Yes, Britons would remain “our neighbours, friends and allies”, but France’s sovereignty lay “in Europe”. In 2020, we had “protected our interests, our industries, our fishermen and our European unity”.Macron faces an uphill re-election campaign a year from now. The youngest president of the French Republic ever, the first to wave as many blue-and-gold EU flags as tricolours during his victorious 2017 campaign, he got the top job because he looked different from all the tired political warhorses from either side. But Macron has now lost his mojo: to gilets jaunes protests, pensions reform unrest and, finally, to Covid.Each time, he was, with some reason, accused of being elitist, out of touch, contemptuous of the common people. He believes even more European integration will save both France and his bacon (he doesn’t really see a difference). And increasingly, both his technocratic inclination and political calculations push him to Britain-bashing. Hence his vindictiveness in the last days before Boris Johnson’s Christmas deal, including the closure of the border. At the last minute, EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had to take over the brunt of the negotiation, to prevent the no-deal the French professed to “prefer to a bad deal”. This outlook is largely due to the smug anti-British sentiment that has prevailed since the 2016 referendum among the French chattering classes, Macron’s natural habitat.I remember, barely a week after the Leave victory, attending a public conference of Paris Europlace, the body representing the bulk of French financial institutions, most of which are headed and peopled by the exact type of technocrat embodied by Macron. “We shall feast on the carcass of the City of London,” the Europlace then-president announced, to near-universal glee in the audience. The general attitude was “kick the Brits out, don’t yield an inch, they never were Europeans at heart”.Over the past four and a half years, I have taken part in scores of French television debates, and the tone never varied. The notion of a choice motivated by a desire for political sovereignty was always pooh-poohed. Brexit was only ever a trick perpetrated to satisfy Boris’s naked ambition a cruel joke played by an Eton-educated cynic and his cohorts. As it happens, I’ve always seen Brexit as a bit of an own goal. It seemed to me that when you’re the second or third-largest economy in the bloc, you can push things your way from the inside. I also saw the benefit of having a truly free-trading country, which also happened to be France’s only serious military partner, in the EU mix. But for the first time since this all started I’ve become so angry with the EU (and with my own country ’s leaders ) that my heart now supports the Brexiteers. After one too many TV debates when, just because I tried to explain the Leavers’ motivations, I got talked down by assorted representatives of the European establishment, each more dismissive and self-satisfied than the other, the current omnishambles of the EU’s health policy power grab was the last straw. Health remains broadly outside the purview of the EU – or at least it does for now. The collective purchasing of vaccines by the 27 was intended to show how much more efficient the EU would be than inidual nations. But, as was superbly uncovered by the German news magazine Der Spiegel, this was one case of mission creep too far. While Britain started to vaccinate in droves, the EU’s vaccination campaign was delayed for weeks because they chose to buy from six suppliers equal amounts of doses even though three of those – national champions like France’s Sanofi – are years away from producing a vaccine.Germany’s excellent health minister, Jens Spahn, eventually forced his government to buy separately tens of millions of Pfizer vaccine doses. I’m afraid we French went the opposite way. Our Vaccination Czar was wheeled out to say that it was an excellent thing that the process was so slow – just as back in March we were told that we didn’t need masks because we had none available – because the logistics chain for the Pfizer vaccine was not fit for purpose.In both cases, we have needed the EU like a fish needs a bicycle.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the number was more than at any previous point in the pandemic and the biggest homeland operation the UK has ever seen in peacetime. Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, said: The New Year will see new levels of Armed Forces support to overcoming this pandemic.  He added that Manchester would be an important contribution to protecting the highest risk groups as the city seeks to recover. As a North-West MP, I am acutely aware of the considerable time many of us have been labouring under some form of lockdown and I hope our soldiers will help us get to the day when these restrictions will start to lift, he said. It comes after 1,500 troops were put on standby last week to run testing in schools and colleges as ministers battle to get pupils back into the classroom. Their duties include providing support and phone advice to institutions needing guidance on the testing process, as well as setting up testing facilities.To date, the MoD has deployed 10 military planners to assist the Vaccine Task Force, with over 150 personnel deployed across the UK to support organisational and logistical components of the deployment programme. Two separate military planners are seconded to support the Vaccine Task Force director, while additionally 20 personnel are assisting with regional vaccine planning, end-to-end logistics and delivery.Meanwhile, from Monday personnel will be trained up as part of the Vaccine Quick Reaction Force. This will initially be 21 teams of 6 personnel assigned to the seven NHS England regions, able to provide surge support to the vaccine roll-out if required by local health authorities.In addition to community testing, 515 personnel remain on-task testing hauliers in Dover and helping to establish 10 new testing sites to improve the flow of traffic across the Channel. Lt Gen Sir Tyrone Urch CBE, Standing Joint Commander UK, said: In recent weeks, our amazing staff have deployed at short notice to set up and staff community testing centres across the country in support of the NHS, DHSC,

former US defence secretaries, including two Donald Trump appointees, have warned against involving the military in the US presidential transition.In an essay published in The Washington Post, Ashton Carter, Leon Panetta, William Perry, Dick Cheney, William Cohen, Robert Gates, Chuck Hagel, Donald Rumsfeld, James Mattis and Mark Esper urged the Pentagon to commit to a peaceful transition of power.Efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory, they said, adding that officials who sought to do so could face serious professional and criminal consequences.Referring to the election process and peaceful transfers of power as hallmarks of our democracy, the secretaries noted that other than Abraham Lincoln\u0027s election in 1860 that ultimately led to the pro-slavery South seceding and the US Civil War, the country has had an unbroken record of peaceful transitions.This year should be no exception, they wrote.The secretaries, who come from both US political parties with Mr Esper and Mr Mattis both appointed by Trump, pointed out that all legal challenges to the presidential election results had been dismissed by the courts, and the votes certified by state governors.It is time to formally certify the Electoral College votes, they said.They also called on acting defence secretary Christopher Miller and all defence department officials to facilitate the transition for President-elect Joe Biden\u0027s administration fully, cooperatively and transparently.They must also refrain from any political actions that undermine the results of the election or hinder the success of the new team, the essay said.Trump, who is refusing to acknowledge his election loss to Biden, until recently held back from allowing government agencies to cooperate with Biden\u0027s team, as is the custom.In late December, Biden said that political appointees at the Pentagon, which Trump has packed with loyalists since the election, have refused to provide a clear picture on troop posture or budgeting.It is nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility, Biden said in Wilmington, Delaware, warning that US adversaries could take advantage of the transition.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge

Manning to crack an encrypted password on US Department of Defence computers and says there is no evidence that anyone\u0027s safety was put at risk.His legal team argued that the prosecution is

It’s a Puritan invention. The celebration of a new year is very old, but it’s meant to land in the middle of the medieval Christmas festival, not bring it to a grinding halt. It’s Christmas until January 6, still midwinter, still cold and dark – so the idea that this is the time to give up booze and rich food is madness.Of course, that’s almost exactly what Public Health England advises. Launching a joyless Better Health campaign (one immediately feels sick), the quango complains that we snacked and smoked and drank our way through 2020, and we need to do something about it. But this only piles masochism onto misery and the reality is that there is no “new year”. We are still stuck in the world of the old one.Twenty-twenty closed on a dopamine high: we left the EU and a new vaccine was approved. But things will get worse before they get better. We are already in the middle of our second great wave and we are due more restrictions not fewer, especially as the Government can now portray them as “one last heave” regardless of the damage done to business or private life. I imagine that in Tier 5, Matt Hancock comes round and superglues you to the living room floor.Vaccines, far from heralding the immediate end of lockdown, will be used to justify it, which would be tolerable if we were guaranteed a swift and painless roll-out, but that’s not on the horizon. It’s estimated that today around 500,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca doses are in place as we move towards our goal of two million innoculations a week, but the NHS counts around 20 million of us as “at risk” of seasonal influenza, so a back-of-the-fag-packet calculation suggests we’ll be waiting at least two months before the vulnerable are covered. There is room to upscale, Tony Blair’s right about that, but given the shortcomings of testing or hospital capacity, scepticism about the NHS’s ability to do it is justified. The experience of America, where the effort is managed by the states, is worth study. Their ambition was to inoculate 20 million by the end of December 14 million doses were sent out but, as of New Year’s Eve, only 2.8 million had been used. Staff shortages were commonly blamed, along with storage issues, and a curious reluctance of some health workers to take part (60 per cent of nursing home staff in Ohio who were offered a jab turned it down). One success story is West Virginia, which provided first-round injections to willing workers and residents at 214 long-term care facilities and is now offering the same service to teachers over 50. Could this be a way out of our schools closure crisis: give teachers the vaccines first?We have got to be hopeful, otherwise we despair, but steel yourself for failure, delay and the knowledge that we will be sitting on our backsides for a while yet. In that context, I think pushing oneself to give up pleasure, wallowing in guilt, is psychologically unhealthy and puts too much onus on iniduals who, at this moment in time, are not in control of their own lives. I’m not sure I’ve kept a single resolution I ever made anyway. If I had, I’d be healthier, better read and have a body like a Greek god.Covid is an exercise in submission. My friends who have resisted the situation – either in terror of disease or disbelief that it could be that bad – seem less healthy, in mind at least, than those who surrendered to the inevitable. I take my lead from the brown bear. Winter is for eating and sleeping. Save the diet for spring.Perhaps PHE should run a campaign against bad television. It’s telling that this Christmas, in the midst of a pandemic, when people were stuck indoors with nothing else to do, they still didn’t turn on the telly. Ratings were down across the board. Overnight totals for the Doctor Who new year special were reportedly a tragic 4.7 million (down from 5.15 million in 2019), beaten by the five million who tuned in to find out who clobbered Adam Barlow on Coronation Street. I expected an Orient Express-style reveal: they all did it, with an unseemly dash for the front of the queue.My Doctor Who source tells me that the production office is a mess and that even BBC bigwigs recognise there’s a problem. Producer Chris Chibnall has made a dog’s dinner of the show, the new season now cut from 11 episodes to eight (blamed on health and safety, but I don’t believe a word of it). With a shrinking general audience, Doctor Who is in hock to its weirdo fan base: it is obsessed with its past and yet doesn’t seem like itself anymore. The casting of Jodie Whittaker was the single greatest disaster in film since the Bond producers decided George Lazenby looked good in a kilt.The last time the show was this bad was in the Eighties, and it was cancelled. My prediction is that they will regenerate Whittaker at the end of this season or the beginning of the next and return to a male, but as I would like the show to die, and as we have established Doctor Who can turn into anything, I’d end it on a post-modern note and have him regenerate into a Dyson vacuum cleaner. Awkward silence. Credits roll. “Diddily-dum, de diddly-dum, de diddly-dum, de dee-dee...”Update: Shortly after I wrote this, reports surfaced suggesting I am right. Whittaker is said to be out and the production team is gearing up for a regeneration. Will it be a man?

The risk to young people is really very, very small indeed, as the scientists continually attest, the risk to staff is very small and of course the benefits of education are so huge.Primary schools in some parts of the country are set to defy the Government amid the rise in cases and stay closed on January 4. Mr Johnson insisted that schools are safe and said councils should abide by advice to reopen in most places other than areas identified as Covid hotspots. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson held an emergency Cabinet Office meeting on January 1 after eight local authorities sent a letter pointing out that areas with higher transmission rates were missing from a list of 50 education authorities told to close schools.Four national teaching unions have called for the delay to apply to all schools in England amid concerns the new strain of Covid-19 poses a threat to teachers, but Ofsted\u0027s chief inspector Amanda Spielman said children\u0027s time out of the classroom should be kept to the absolute minimum.Anne Longfield, the Children\u0027s Commissioner for England, echoed Mrs Spielman\u0027s sentiments and called for teachers to be vaccinated as a priority.Some councils have taken matters into their own hands, such as Brighton and Hove City Council, which advised its primary schools to reopen remotely despite government advice.The Prime Minister said: My message to such councils is that they should be guided by the public health advice, which at the moment is that schools are safe in those areas where we\u0027re not being driven by the new variant to close them.Senior government sources have admitted some schools could stay shut until mid-February if Tier 4 restrictions fail.Asked if he would close primary schools if the restrictions could not contain the virus, Mr Johnson said: We\u0027ve got to keep things under constant review but we will be driven not by any political considerations but entirely by the public health question.Ministers will review school closures on January 18.The overwhelming majority of primary schools are opening as planned on January 4, Gavin Williamson said, but in a small number of Tier 4 areas where infection rates are highest, only vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will attend primary schools in person.  Every school has been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Keeping schools open as long as possible is uppermost in all of our plans, Mr Williamson told the Commons.The evidence about the new Covid variant and rising infection rates have required some immediate adjustment to our plans for the new term.Read more on the tier system: In the following areas, primary schools will only open for vulnerable children and children of key workers on January 4:Pupils will return to secondary schools on a staggered basis during the first full three weeks of January. This is to allow for mass Covid testing, in which pupils in Year 11 and Year 13 will be prioritised because of GCSE and A-Level studies.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least Jan 18, when secondary schools and colleges will reopen fully after two weeks of mass testing - two weeks after term was supposed to start.Because the Covid infection rate is particularly high among this age group, we are going to allow more time so that every school and college is able to roll-out testing for all of its pupils and staff, Mr Williamson said.This kind of mass testing will benefit everyone in the community. It will break those chains of transmission.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year group and very rarely the entire school could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"south korean population shrinks amid declining birthrate","story":"South Korea’s population contracted for the first time in the country’s history in 2020, as Asia’s fourth largest economy struggled with the convergence of an alarmingly low birth rate and a rapidly aging society. According to census figures released by the interior ministry on Sunday, the East Asian nation’s population has fallen by 20,838 to 51,829,023 since the end of 2019.  The decline was caused largely by an elevated number of deaths surpassing the number of births, reported the Yonhap News Agency, with the birthrate plummeting by 10.65 percent over 2020. The South Korean capital, Seoul, saw its population drop by a little over 60,000. South Korea, alongside its East Asian neighbours Japan and Taiwan, faces a demographic timebomb that has set off alarm bells among senior officials.  Amid the rapidly declining birth rate, the government needs to undertake fundamental changes to its relevant policies, the interior ministry said in a statement on Sunday. According to an article published in June in Springer by experts Kee Whan Kim, and Oh Seok Kim, from Korea University, 16 rural regions were set to become super-aged last year, followed by the rest of the country, including metropolitan areas, by 2029.  Their study warns that one unintended consequence will be a drop in blood supplies for medical transfusions, that will impact cancer treatment. Last year an annual report by the UN World Population Fund revealed South Korea to have the world’s lowest birth rate.  The government has sought to mitigate the problem with financial incentives to encourage young families to have more children. In December, it announced a new policy to provide $275 as a monthly bonus to all infants in the first year after their birth, starting in 2022. The amount is projected to increase to $457 by 2025. However, many young women are increasingly rejecting the idea of traditional marriages and family lives, where they are often expected to bear the brunt of domestic chores as well as managing their own career. The shunning of conventional family expectations has coincided with a growing feminist movement that is pushing back against unfair wages, inequality in the workplace and pervasive sexual harassment. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tier 5 lockdown rules restrictions covid uk","story":"England could be back in lockdown by the middle of the month, Government sources suggested, prompting fears that the country will be kept in a straitjacket until at least Easter.The  understands that discussions about the return of shielding have already begun in Government, and a further announcement on school closures could come as soon as this week.  He told the BBC\u0027s Marr show on Jan 3: It\u0027s the Tier 4 restrictions, it\u0027s obeying them. It is thinking about breaking essentially every possible route of transmission we possibly can. Those are the things that are absolutely necessary and it is pretty clear we\u0027re going to need more.When asked if he thought that schools also would need to close as part of these measures, he said: We know transmission happens within schools, we know that a person between 12 and 16 is seven times more likely than others in a household to bring an infection into a household.Sizeable chunks of the Midlands, the North East and parts of the North West are now living under Tier 4 restrictions.As events developed rapidly, there were reports that the Government\u0027s key Covid-O committee that oversees restrictions was expected to meet on Jan 4 to decide changes to the coronavirus regime.Rules in Tier 4 are similar to those of the last national lockdown:Pressure has been mounting on ministers to expand Tier 4 restrictions in the face of increasing strain on hospitals in England, where the number of patients has surpassed the April peak of the first wave.On Dec 29, the NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens warned that doctors and nurses are back in the eye of the storm.Speaking on the Marr show on Jan 3, the Prime Minister said: It is bumpy and it\u0027s going to be bumpy.On Jan 2, the UK recorded  57,725 new cases of Covid-19, with cases topping 50,000 for five days running. An additional 445 deaths within 28 days of positive test were also recorded. This took the country\u0027s total to 74,570.Healthcare workers have pleaded with people to take the restrictions seriously, as hospitals report huge difficulties with capacity and staffing. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said some trusts were reporting up to three times the number of Covid patients as at the peak of the first wave.This means hospitals and also ambulance services in Tier 4 areas and beyond are incredibly busy, compounded by increasing staff absences due to illness and the need to self-isolate, she said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"children could go school boris","story":"NewsopinionChildren could go to schoolBoris Johnson had only used his brain.

But sheaposs learning to read and write, itaposs an important time. She needs lots of supervision from a trained educator, not a mummy who canapost spare more than half an hour. Sheaposs at very little risk, but the risk is growing at a rate thataposs out of control, which is why, where we live, the schools are closed.But journalists are classied as key workers, so she could go.

Their risk is greater than ours, and they share our social bubble as though we are one household. I wouldnapost send herthey were living under the same roof.About am, I decided that education was too important, and grandparents would just have to be distant until they were vaccinated, probably later this month. Lunch was packed, child dressed, fed, and taken to school in the rain. And then: oh. Inset day. Bugger.  We shall do it all again tomorrow, instead. And across the country, whether schools are closed or not, parents are agonising over the same things. Whataposs best for the children, for the work they must do, for the grandparents  On top of that, will it harm the teachers, raise the infection rate, put more strain on systems that are close to breaking point  Those without children, who live alone or with friends, have similar quandaries and are making personalised risk assessments that cannot possibly take into account the risks of all those who take the same train or use the same cash point. We are desperate for a binary answer, logic that is clear rather than circuitous, or a moral choice that does not contradict itself. We have taken our cue from the government and its ministers, who have spent  months alternately frozen by indecision and frenzied by panic. Unable to decide between lives and livelihoods, they have cavilled, vacillated, and bumbled to such an extent theyaposve infected the whole country with it.Itaposs no good Boris Johnson saying schools are safe. This is the man who shook hands with Covid- patients on the same day scientists said it could kill you. I mean, you might as well ask the cat. SAGE told him on February  that , might die. He locked down on March :  days late. They told him on September  to lockdown again. He did it on November :  days late.And on December  they told him schools would need to close, and there might need to be a third lockdown. Three days later he let families celebrate Christmas, yesterday he declared schools should open. Itaposs been  days so far, and counting.The cat knows, eventhe Prime Minister doesnapost, that heaposll have to lock down late again.  All the fretting does have answers, though. We can distance from grandparents,the vaccine is due. Teachers will be at low risk,theyaposre on the priority list. Those children without access to internet learning wonapost suffer,schools can reopen. The trains will be safeeveryone follows the rules, the mutations kept under controlwe screen at the border, and fund more than  in  people who need to self-isolate. But those answers all contain an aposapos. And they all depend on a government that can organise, deliver, and be consistent. And thataposs an aposapos thataposs not just big, but apparently insurmountable.Last week, an unofficial calculator reckoned that, with m jabs a week and % uptake, my parents were due the vaccine in January. Today, even assuming the same targets, it says sometime in May. My own prediction has been bumped from this summer to next. How is it that a country blessed by wealth, free education, a world-renowned health service, and a safe, new vaccine in less than a year, can be so utterly adrt in the greatest crisis of our letimes Never put a question in copyyou donapost have to, my first chief reporter used to tell me. It makes you look like you donapost know the answer. So far in this column, Iaposve asked four. And when you look at the mess weaposre in, itaposs easy to be like Johnson - wild blustering about what is best, because the alternative means accepting things are so bad there IS no best, any more. There are more covid patients in hospitals than there were in April. But in April, infections were falling thanks to lockdown. Today, theyaposre rising, thanks to Christmas. The vaccines weaposve been gted by science are threatened by mutations made possible by the covid reservoir that was left to ferment. And one of the strongest economies in the world is on its knees, realising at last that it could have been savedlives had only been put first.

Primary schools are meant to be fully open in all but  council areas from today, despite a new iant of Covid-. But a huge number of schools outside the  worst-hit areas in England have refused to comply. Those declining to open include schools in Brighton and parts of Birmingham, the Black Country, Essex, Mansfield, Suffolk, Norfolk, Devon, County Durham, Northumberland, Berkshire and Derbyshire. While closures are not yet approved by the government in those areas, they can becouncils formally request them. It’s understood the government will consider any such requests this week - and make further decisions “as early as possible” during the week about any further closures. The government has not said how many councils have formally requested measures under the “contingency framework”. Any official decisions will not be taken until being escalated through the government’s Local Action Committee system. That includes input from the Department of Health, Chief Medical Officer, Public Health England and Test and Trace. A joint plea by six education unions today blasted the government’s “chaotic handling” of school reopening. While secondary schools plan to fully open nationally from January , primary schools have a patchwork approach. Primary schools must officially stay shut from today in  council areas, including all of London, to all except vulnerable and key workers’ children.But Boris Johnson has told pupils in the rest of England to go back - despite hinting more classrooms will shut soon.And his Education Secretary has already had to upgrade the list of  from  originally after a backlash in London.  A joint statement by the GMB, NAHT, NASUWT, NEU, UNISON and Unite said: “The government’s chaotic handling of the opening of schools has caused confusion for teachers, school staff and parents alike. “Bringing all pupils back into classrooms while the rate of infection is so high is exposing education sector workers to serious risk of ill-health and could fuel the pandemic. “Unions have called for a pause in the reopening of schools for anyone other than vulnerable children and children of key workers, and a move to remote learning for all while Covid-secure working arrangements are reviewed. “All school staff continuing to work in schools should be given priority access to Covid- vaccinations.  “Instead of casually asserting that schools are safe, the Prime Minister should sit down with unions to discuss a joint approach to ensuring safe working arrangements in all schools.”A cross-party group of politicians, campaigners and charities, including ex-PM Tony Blair and three Labour former Education Secretaries, has written to ministers warning of a “digital ide” as children learn remotely.Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, who organised the letter, said: “Children on the wrong side of the digital ide have neither the data nor the devices to log in from home when their schools close. “In a country with free state education, no child’s education should be dependent on their internet connection.” "},{"url":null,"title":"should kids go school today","story":"NewsShould my kids go to school today  Full list of areas where primaries are staying shutHundreds of primary schools will stay shut today as children should have ed from the Christmas holidays - the Government has advised that those in London and parts of the South East do not openmirrorShareCommentsByEmma BowdenJeremy CulleyAssistant Editor:,  JAN NewsExperts fear the new iant is more transmissible among children \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The couple had no idea about the impending pandemic and say the purpose of their stay on the  acre rocky chunk of land was simply to take  months out to enjoy a slower pace of le. While taking scenic walks, going fishing and tending to homegrown crops, Luke, , and Sarah, , have easily managed to remain isolated and keep themselves clear of Covid-. Luke, a joiner by trade, said: Itaposs been really weird and strange hearing about everything thataposs happening while being isolated on this little island. As you can imagine, we havenapost had to worry about social distancing. He added: The experience as a whole has been incredible. The pace of le is so slow but itaposs lovely, we spend our days out walking with the dogs, growing our own food and learning new skills.Itaposs not for everyone but we have loved it. Owey Island is a small patch of land off the coast of Donegal containing a handful of properties with no schools or shops and only two narrow roads going through it. Luke and Sarah are living in a small cottage using coal fires to keep warm, a tank to collect rainwater, gas bottles to cook and solar  to charge their electrical items.They use the collected water as well as water from a well to wash themselves and clean their clothes while growing their own food for sustenance, raising hens for eggs and even braving the seas for fish. Luke said he started as a rubbish fisherman and that he isnapost much better now but added he has been able to learn how to catch pollock, the most common type of fish in the area. Due to their living conditions he also learned the old fashioned preparation technique of salting his catch so that it can be stored and remain edible for months on end.The coupleaposs only way off the island is via dinghy around three quarters of a mile to another island, which is connected to the mainland by a bridge. While there are some houses on Owey they are only inhabited in the summer months and, according to local history books, the last time anyone spent the winter there was . Luke and Sarah are originally from Leeds, West Yorks., but were enjoying le living in the Scottish Highlands when the chance to move to Ireland presented itself.They noticed an advert online offering the opportunity to become the tenants of a small cottage there and decided the chance was too good to pass up so decided to take a year off from work. According to Luke, the homeowner wanted to prove itaposs possible to spend an entire winter season on Owey in a bid to encourage others to do the same in the future. Luke said other residents started arriving on the island as summer  approached and that many helped them by teaching them about how to survive the conditions.  He added: Over the summer the community feeling here is great. But as soon as autumn started coming in everyone left and we were left on our own, luckily we were well prepared to cope thanks to the help of other people. Luke said him and we Sarah pass the time in Owey by tending to the property, reading and playing with their two rescue dogs, both staffies, which they took with them. Luckily, thanks to nearby shipping lanes, the couple are able to get good signal on their phones, which means they can speak to their families back in Leeds and keep up to date with the news.

Both vaccines need to be given in two doses which are now set to be given  weeks apart in a bid to give more people their first shot sooner.

Explaining that this is only a predicted estimate, the omni calculator site reads: We also indicate how long it might be before you get the vaccine, based on the vaccination rate. “By default, we base these figures on a vaccination rate of  million vaccinations a week and a default uptake rate of .%.” “As more data on the actual vaccination rate is released, we may revise this default value.” The calculator also has an advanced mode that allows you to change the vaccination rate and uptake figure.

Alcohol alters the make-up of the microorganisms in the gut which help to halt bacteria and viruses spreading throughout the body. This can mean the white blood cells - which release antibodies to attack the likes of Covid- and other bugs - become damaged or reduced and unable to fight off an attack. As part of new BBC documentary, The Truth About... Boosting Your Immune System, which airs on Wednesday, Dr Ronx Ikharia conducted an experiment with Prosecco. Have you had your coronavirus vaccine  Let us know in the comments section below The emergency medicine specialist took blood samples before and after drinking three glasses of the popular Italian sparkling white wine.  They found the quantity was enough to reduce the levels of white lymphocyte cells in the blood by half. Meanwhile, University of Manchester immunologist Professor Sheena Cruickshank said the reduction in lymphocytes could lower the effectiveness of the bodyaposs immune response.  As a result, she has warned anyone receiving the vaccine to abstain from alcohol immediately before and after the jab. She told the programme: You need to have your immune system working tip-top to have a good response to the vaccine, soyouaposre drinking the night before, or shortly afterwards, thataposs not going to help.  "},{"url":null,"title":"head teacher defies orders reopen","story":"NewsHead teacher defies orders to reopen school telling parents ‘keep your kids at home’Marish Academy Trust head Gill Denham told parents at the Slough, Berkshire schools, that she would keep her children at home as infection rates skyrocketmirrorShareCommentsByMatt Strudwick:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video boris-johnson-schools-safe-children-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The executive head teacher of the top-performing primary school told parents she would keep her own children at home.Marish Academy Trust head Gill Denham warned that she cannot guarantee pupils will not be exposed to the virus, reports Berkshire Live.The trust runs Marish and Willow primary schools in Slough made the comments on the eve of schools reopening tomorrow.Slough has one of the highest coronavirus infection rates in the country.The Government is under increasing pressure to keep them closed to curb the spread of Covid-. Slough Borough Council and teaching union representatives have been lobbying the Department for Education since Wednesday over their dismay at education secretary Gavin Williamsonaposs announcement that schools in the area would be reopening on Monday. Yet those warnings of the potential risks to teachers and pupils in an area where the infection rate is . cases per , people - and akin to London boroughs - has so far not been heeded. The Government has been accused of creating chaos with the National Education Union- telling teachers it was not safe for them toto the classroom. In a letter to parents, Mrs Denham wrote: Like many of you the leadership of Marish Academy Trust are surprised that Slough schools have not been included within the contingency plan which mandates the closure.  Neither I, or any other school leader in Slough can guarantee that pupils or staff will not be exposed to the virus in school or on the way to or from school, when our experience has already shown us that Covid- can easily spread through a community, she wrote.It is a question of how long before we have multiple cases and bubble and whole school closure, rather than whether we will get any. Already we have had to make dficult choices on a weekly basis about children and staff who are clinically extremely vulnerable.The trust had to shut down both schools a week earlier than planned for the Christmas holidays as a surge in cases left so many staff members absent meaning it was no longer safe to operate.And with pupils due totomorrow there is growing confusion and concern among school leaders as to whether they will be able to reopen, with Mrs Denham giving parents the green light to keep their children off school,they felt it was necessary, and switch to online learning.  As a parent and grandparent myself,I feel that the risk of my child or someone  in my family contracting Covid- is too high,they attend school from Monday, I would keep them at home, she wrote. It may be that this is the decision some of you come to for your own families. Rest assured, online learning will be provided for all those pupils who do not attend in person. Marish and Willow schools will remain open for the children of key workers, those with vulnerabilities or any pupils whose parents want them to attend. Ordinarily, Marish Academy Trust prides itself on having high pupil attendance, but in these extraordinary circumstances, we will not be recommending fines or any action is taken against any parent who does not send their child into school during January . In a tweet to his constituents and , followers, Slough MP Tan Dhesi said many parents had contacted him with concerns about schools reopening. He said it was a Government decision but he had discussed the issue with Slough Council leadership, which was consulting with local schools on their views. Slough Council have reached out to schools to ascertain views and we’ll take steps accordingly. Boris Johnson has so far refused to yield to growing pressure saying he has no doubt that schools are safe and parents should send primary-age kids back to the classroom."},{"url":null,"title":"how oxford vaccine compare pfizer","story":"NewsHow does the Oxford coronavirus vaccine compare to Pfizer and Moderna jabs Today the first patient was injected with the Oxford University and AstraZeneca vaccine, weeks after the Pfizer-BioNTech jab was rolled out by the NHS, with other vaccines in advanced stages of developmentmirrorShareCommentsByDave BurkeNina Massey:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv tv-news video oxford-covid-vaccine-given-first-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

It has been hailed as a huge breakthrough that will start to bring the coronavirus nightmare to an end - although there are still questions over whether it can prevent people transmitting the virus.Today Health Secretary Matt Hancock branded it a triumph of British science, saying there are , doses of the Oxford vaccine ready to go. It comes weeks after the Pfizer vaccine was approved, with several others - including one made by US drugmaker Moderna - in advanced stages of testing. The offering from Moderna is under rolling review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency .What do you make of the vaccine rollout  Have your say in the comments belowHow does the Oxford vaccine compare with the Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna vaccines  Data published in The Lancet medical journal in early December showed the vaccine was  per cent effective in preventing Covid- in people given two standard doses of the vaccine and, following a dosing error,  per cent in people given a half first dose of the vaccine followed by a full second dose. The Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have efficacies of  per cent and . per cent respectively. However, the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored initially at very low temperatures, and can travel for no more than six hours after it leaves cold storage. It can then be kept in a normal fridge at C to C for a maximum of five days. The Oxford vaccine only needs to be stored at C to C. Both jabs require two doses. How do we know the vaccines are safe  Researchers report that their trials have not suggested any signicant safety concerns. NHS guidance says: So far, thousands of people have been given a Covid- vaccine and reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, have been very rare. No long-term complications have been reported.  What  has the UK secured access to  The Government has pre-ordered a total of  million doses of Oxfordaposs vaccine, which is almost enough for most of the population. It also belatedly struck deals for seven million doses of the Moderna jab from the US. The deals cover four dferent classes: adenoviral vaccines, mRNA vaccines, inactivated whole virus vaccines and protein adjuvant vaccines. The UK has secured access to: million doses of the Oxford vaccine  million doses of the Novavax vaccine Some  million doses from Janssen  million doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine million doses of a vaccine being developed by Valneva  million doses of protein adjuvant vaccine from GlaxoSmithKlineand Sanofi Pasteur Seven million doses of the jab on offer from Moderna in the US Arenapost other countries working on vaccines  Yes.

It’s the same old incompetent Boris Johnson in Downing Street. The bumbling ­ditherer seems unable to grasp that ­immediate tighter virus restrictions are required to save lives. Boasting that many schools will reopen today while simultaneously conceding that they will need to shut in a few weeks is unforgivably reckless vacillation that will cost hundreds, maybe thousands, of lives. With pupils spreading Covid-, a strong PM would act with urgency. But Johnson is weak, indecisive, confused, bullied by Tory critics and obsessed with popularity. Decisive leaders accept flak as part of the job.  Labour head Keir Starmer is guilty of hedging his bets on schools but Major Foresight’s latest demand is highly likely to be followed again by a Private Hindsight eventually falling into line. Dawdling Johnson’s refusal to follow the logic of his own arguments until it’s too late is Einstein’s definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and somehow expecting a dferent result. The Premier is a terrible part of the problem when delaying tougher controls in March, October and December piled countless bodies on a funeral pyre topping ,. The NHS struggling to treat an explosion in cases between Christmas and the New Year underlines the idiocy of his intention to create a Santa super-spreader. Given his terrible record of ­ineptitude, turning a drama into a crisis and a crisis into a catastrophe, Johnson is still capable of blowing the vaccination programme.

The newspaper also reports that a further announcement on school closures could come as soon as this week After Prime Minister Boris Johnson signalled tougher restrictions would be brought in within weeks, pressure mounted on the Government to act far more swtly as Labour demanded a lockdown within hours.Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Prime Minister of presiding over a chaotic response to the coronavirus pandemic as he insisted on new restrictions immediately to try to regain control of the situation. Sir Keir told reporters the Prime Minister should not hint at new restrictions within weeks but, instead, act now. The Labour leader said: The virus is clearly out of control. We canapost allow the Prime Minister to use up the next two or three weeks and then bring in a national lockdown which is inevitable. Do it now. Thataposs the necessary first step to get the virus back under control. Speaking on Sunday as controversy raged over whether more schools should be shut, Sir Keir said further closures of classrooms were inevitable. Sir Keir insisted new moves must be part of a wider strategy that has a national lockdown in place in the next  hours.  He added: The Prime Minister is hinting at it, but heaposs not doing it. We canapost afford that delay again. Letaposs not have the Prime Minister saying aposIaposm going to do it, but not yetapos, thataposs the problem he has made so many times. In response to the comments, a Number  source said: The Prime Minister has been consistently clear that we are driven by the need to protect the NHS and save lives - unlike Labour who have spent the last ten months playing party politics. We have moved more areas into Tier  to bear down on the new iant and escalated other areas into Tier . This targeted approach is the right one, and is kept under review based on the latest data.

In the late s, the men and women in her friendship group found they just werenapost meeting people who took their fancy, and who shared their views and ambitions, in bars and clubs - they were getting frustrated. Long before online dating became a thing, Karen had the idea of setting up a matchmaking company to bring together like-minded singletons - and  years later, sheaposs responsible for thousands of marriages and countless babies. Speaking to The Mirror, she explains: There was nothing like it around. I was in my s. A lot of my friends couldnapost meet the right kind of people so I thought maybe there is a business in it - and there was. The dating rules had changed. Women had their own careers, their own mortgages. We werenapost looking for someone to provide for us. We wanted to be independent. It was dficult to meet people in wine bars and pubs that you had something in common with. They wanted someone who had mutual respect for them, where they would be a team and not one part of the equation was more successful than the other. There was nothing for young, forward thinking professionals who wanted to take charge of their own le.Karen jumped straight into her new venture, Sara Eden, quitting her job at Buckingham Palace with enough money saved up to keep her going for a few months. She started interviewing people at her kitchen table, finding out everything she could about the singleton to find them their perfect match. She said: Iaposm good with people and I had a fantastic gut instinct. It wasnapost long before she was able to move her business into an office in Windsor and start to step things up. At the beginning, she charged singletons £ to help them look for love. For the fee, they would visit the office once a month and be allowed to pick  dates. After getting to know each inidual, Karen would try to work out who was best suited to who. Before long she was making good money, which allowed her to start advertising in national newspapers. She said: I started going to pubs and handing out business cards.People were fascinated because there was nothing like it. In those days we had to sell the concept because there was a stigma, but itaposs changed completely now. People now say they hope we can take them on. The Internet has brought dating into peopleaposs homes. Youaposre meeting people who want to be met and who want the same as you. Summing up online dating and match making services perfectly, Karen compares it to buying a house - saying that you would never look for a new home by just walking up and down streets. You find an expert who shows you the ones that are available, and go from there. Karen set up the business in September, and was invited to her first matchmade wedding in the following December, in , - Malcolm and Vicki. The couple invited Karen to their wedding celebrations, and she says it was a fantastic day. She says: I remember it like it was yesterday. He phoned me to say he was going to propose, it was lovely.Iaposve still going the wedding photo on the wall. At the wedding of another couple she set up, Karen was shocked when the mother-of-the-bride asked the vicar to call her up to the alter to be part of the official photos. A few years and two children later, the couple invited Karen to a barbecue at their house and they recreated the fun photo. One of her favourite success stories is a two-generation set up, where she matched up a couple and then introduced their son to his bride. After  years of matchmaking, Karenaposs business has come a long way but while the logistics are very dferent, her aim is the same - to help people fall in love. Sheaposs set up thousands of couples and has lost track of the number of weddings and babies that have come from her matchmaking skills. She now has a second office in Westminster and has clients around the world. She explains: The best part is changing peopleaposs lives. When people phone up and say this time last year I was by myself, and joining the agency was the best thing Iaposve ever done. Sometimes you just get a feeling about two people. You get a feeling that they are similar and they want the same things. I canapost explain it but Iaposm not often wrong. You never know who is going to walk through the door. You canapost help everybody, sometimes people are single for a reason, but by large itaposs very exciting. How many jobs can you go into in the morning and by the afternoon you might have changed someoneaposs le. Karen has seen her company change drastically through the pandemic. The first few weeks were extremely quiet and she was forced to furlough the entire team, but things started to pick up. All of a sudden it went bonkers.

It has been hailed as a huge breakthrough that will start to bring the coronavirus nightmare to an end - although there are still questions over whether it can prevent people transmitting the virus.Today Health Secretary Matt Hancock branded it a triumph of British science, saying there are , doses of the Oxford vaccine ready to go.  He told the BBC the next delivery is coming early this week, to be delivered to patients next week. Understandably people will have plenty of questions about the Oxford vaccine, with some of the key ones covered below.What do you think about the vaccine rollout  Let us know in the comments section below Who can get a Covid vaccine Every adult in Britain, unless doctors advise against it for medical reasons. New guidelines say women who are pregnant or breastfeeding can now have the jabmedics believe the benefits outweigh the risks. Currently it is being given to people over , those who live or work in care homes and healthcare workers at high risk.When will I get it Vaccines will be given first to  million people who are at the highest risk from Covid, and staff in the NHS and care homes. Can I buy it Vaccines are provided free on the NHS and cannot be bought privately anywhere in the UK. The NHS will invite people to have the vaccine, and people have been told to wait until they are contacted.Where will I get it It will be available from GP surgeries, hospitals and mass vaccination centres.Can I choose which vaccine I get The UK has only approved two so far - one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech and the other by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. Brits will not be able to choose which of these they receive. What is the gap between doses The second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine can be offered three to  weeks after the first and the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine four to  weeks after the first. But they will typically be given  weeks apart.How effective are the vaccines Trials suggest the Oxford vaccine is  per cent effective  days after the first dose, rising to  per centthe second dose is taken  weeks later. Trials show the Pfizer vaccine is  per cent effective.Can Ito normal le once I have been vaccinated Not yet. Even those who have been vaccinated will still be bound by law and tier restrictions. The vaccines protect those who have had it but it is unclearthey reduce transmission. Why will the Oxford jab speed up vaccination It is cheaper and easier to transport, store and use. It costs around £ per dose compared with £ for Pfizer’s. The Pfizer jab must be stored at -C. The Oxford jab can be stored at normal fridge temperatures.Are the vaccines safe Yes. Both have gone through all of the usual clinical trials and have been tested on thousands of people. NHS guidance says: So far, thousands of people have been given a Covid- vaccine and reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, have been very rare. No long-term complications have been reported.

When the -year-old bride stepped out of her carriage and walked up the steps of St Paulaposs Cathedral, the world was in awe of her statement dress. The stunning ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown featured more than , pearls and a long train. However, there was one person who wasnapost happy when she saw the dress on the wedding day - the woman who designed it. Elizabeth Emanuel and her husband spent months creating the royal wedding dress, going to extreme s to ensure the design remained secret. Speaking during ITVaposs Invitation to the Royal Wedding, Elizabeth admitted being horried when she saw how creased Dianaaposs dress had become. She said: We did know it would crease a bit but when I saw her arrive at St Paulaposs and we saw the creasing I actually felt faint. I was horried, really, because it was quite a lot of creasing. It was a lot more than we thought.  They had done a dress rehearsal but using a dferent material, and it wasnapost anywhere near as bad. But she now says that looking back, that moment was actually her favourite shot of the Princess in the dress, comparing it to a caterpillar coming out of a cocoon and becoming a butterfly. As well as the famous dress, David and Elizabeth created a second, back up dress in case the main one was leaked. David told  People : At the time we wanted to make absolutely sure that the dress was a surprise.We didn’t try it on Diana. We never even discussed it. We wanted to make sure that we had something there it was for our own peace of mind, really. So Diana never even saw the second dress which was made from the same fabric as the first and also featured ruffles around the neck.  However there were a few big dferences between the two. The secret dress was a lot less lavish than the original version, lacking the antique lace and , mother-of-pearl sequins as well as the -foot train. It was also never completed as it wasnapost needed in the end. As Diana was ft , exactly the same height as Charles, she decided to wear low-heeled shoes on her wedding day so she wasnapost taller than him.

Bookies are already slashing the odds of this winter being the coldest since records began, with parts of the UK having already seen temperatures plummet as low as -C over the Christmas period. Siberian winds of more than mph are pushing in from the east, meaning the already icy temperatures will have extra bite - with widespread snow expected before the end of the week.A yellow weather warning is in place between the north-east of Scotland and Nottingham until am today.Icy patches may cause some tricky travel conditions, the warning states. BBC meteorologist Ben Rich said temperatures on Monday are unlikely to rise about C, adding: With that brisk wind it is going to feel really chilly out there. He said late on Wednesday outbreaks of snow are expected in north-west Scotland, while a frontal system will push its way across the country overnight into Thursday taking some rain, sleet and snow with it.  Just about anywhere, you could see some rain, some sleet, and some snow - could even be some snow to quite low levels, continued Mr Rich. On Sunday, Loch Glascanoch in the Scottish Highlands saw temperatures of -.C. Some forecasts suggest  inches of snow could fall in just one day during the middle of the month as the major freeze continues.  Met Office Meteorologist Alex Burkill said: Obviously itaposs very cold and itaposs going to stay cold through this week.Whilst there will be some wintry hazards around, itaposs not really until the end of the week until we see any signicant snow.The sudden stratosphere warningwhich led to the Beast from the East storm three years ago could cause chaos again this month, reports The Sun.  An SSW occurs when the temperature in the stratosphere rises by C, reversing Britainaposs wind pattern and bringing in freezing blasts from Siberia. RAC Breakdown spokesman Simon Williams said: The message for those who have to drive is to adjust their speed according to the conditions and leave extra stopping distance so  doesnapost begin with an unwelcome bump and an insurance claim. Snow and ice are by far the toughest driving conditions, sothey can be avoided thataposs probably the best policy. Early next week temperatures may begin to climb a little, added Mr Rich.

Anne waited two years to thank dental student Sean Haycock for helping her to beat leukaemia for the second time. When they finally got to hug in , Sean revealed he was about to donate more cells to cure another woman with blood cancer, just as he had saved Anne. Anne, , said: “Sean gave me the ultimate gt, he saved my le. He’s my hero. I was so excited to meet him for the first time. It made Christmas so special. “I couldn’t believe it when he told me he was going to donate again. I felt very emotional, because I knew how much it would mean to that person. I hope all three of us can meet up one day.”  Sean said: “I was nervous about meeting Anne but when she walked in, it felt like I had known her for years.” Anne was first diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia in . She dismissed her symptoms – night sweats, fatigue and pain in her side – as the menopause, until a blood test revealed she had high levels of defective white blood cells. She had to take chemotherapy tablets and attend check-ups every three months, and the cancer went into remission. But  years later a blood test revealed that Anne, who has a daughter Lynsey, had developed a dferent kind of leukaemia. The seamstress, from Shipley in West Yorkshire, said: “They told me it was very rare to have two types of leukaemia. I’d been looking a bit pale and feeling tired. I went to pieces. It felt so unfair.” This time, Anne could not manage the disease with drugs. She needed a stem cell transplant but none of her family matched her rare blood tissue group. Her only hope was to find a stranger on the donor register. Luckily Sean, , was a match and Anne said: “It was such a relief.” Anne spent three months having chemotherapy to blast the cancer and prepare her body for a transplant, wiping out her own immune system so it would not try to fight Sean’s transplanted cells. Anne said: “I was so weak I couldn’t get up to have a shower. I began to wondermy body was going to get better but my family and friends kept me going.”  Blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan arranged for Sean, who studied in New-castle, to travel to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield to donate his cells. Strict protocols to protect the donor and recipient’s identities meant Anne could only write to Sean after  days to thank him but could not include any information that might identy her. The pair became penpals and Sean said: “Those letters made it hit home what I had done. It convinced a lot of my friends to join the stem cell register.” After two years the pair were allowed to meet and Anne and her family travelled to Sean’s home in County Durham, where his parents laid on a festive spread.

When they were first matched with the baby, they were smitten and promised the birth parents theyaposd raise him well, reports Daily Star.We assured them the child would be loved which was the truth because we instantly fell in love with our baby boy, they said. After eight months, they began to feel twinges of guilt that they hadnapost made more of an effort to connect their perfect Chinese son with his cultural roots. So, they befriended people in the Chinese ex-pat community near where they lived, including a couple who became their sonaposs aunt and uncle figures. They enrolled him in Mandarin classes, the countryaposs official language, and even took him on numerous family trips to China. However, whilst helping him fill out his college application  years later they discovered theyaposd made a major mistake.  The man said: Digging through my office for the needed paperwork, I came across his adoption papers and it was only then that I saw it. Something so obvious, so painfully, brick-to-the-face obvious, something that neither my we nor I, in the stupidity of our youth, had registered... - his birth parentsapos surnames were Park and Kim – meaning he was Korean, not Chinese. Since being shared, the video has been liked more than . million times on TikTok. Despite their colossal error, the video was flooded with thousands of comments of people who praised their efforts.

The heartwarming letter was sent by a neighbour, who also left a gt to make up for their thievery.The unnamed woman from Sydney’s Sutherland Shire shared a look at the note on Facebook and also included her reply and the whole thing is so sweet that it has brought people to tears.According to the handwritten message, the neighbour wasnapost stealing the flowers to be malicious or for personal gain - they were intended for her goddaughteraposs wedding. A mix up at the flower market had meant the bride-to-be wasnapost going to have a bouquet of beautul flowers on her big day, so they had to improvise quickly to help her find something to use. She spotted her neighbouraposs garden full of beautul flowers and knew they would be perfect for the special occasion.Shared on social media, on a Sutherland Shire community Facebook group, the note read: Hi Neighbour, I live around the corner and my goddaughter is getting married tomorrow. Sadly the flower market is closed so we couldnapost get the flowers we wanted. I came to askwe could have three of your hydrangeas but no one answered the door. I hope you donapost mind but I took three little ones off your amazing plants which are covered with flowers! . You are our lesaver and will make the wedding day tomorrow that bit more special.

He was usually always right about everything.“Listen,anybody stepped out of line he would come down on you like a ton of bricks.“But, as a group, we weren’t like that. We stuck together as players and we are still all mates.“Deep down, there was real respect for Jim because we, more than anybody, knew what a great manager he was.”Holt also highlighted how McLean even enlisted his we Doris to help build a family atmosphere at Tannadice.He said: “Doris would take our wives out for a meal every so often and they would all have a great time.“It was a lovely gesture and the players all appreciated it.“I know it was Jim’s idea and his way of bringing everyone closer together. He was also the one who footed the bill.”Holt recently visited Tannadice to view the tributes to McLean that have been left at the stadium.He added: “It was really nice to see how many people had taken the time to go down and pay their respects.”BLETHER: Dundee photo from archives featuring Jim McLean, Jocky Scott and Bobby Cox and more Sunday Welfare AFA memories\" title\"#BLETHER: Dundee photo from archives featuring Jim McLean, Jocky Scott and Bobby Cox and more Sunday Welfare AFA memories# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp jim-mclean-jocky-scott-bobby-cox-dundee-fc-united-blether-with-brown embed # secretzeTDQwVtq\" data-secret\"zeTDQwVtq\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\":This offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua.. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

","title":"tightening level four restrictions what changes could the first minister announce in mondays covid 19 statement","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will announce further measures to tackle a #rapid increase# in Covid- cases to parliament on Monday.In a statement released on Sunday, Ms Sturgeon said the country must take #all steps# to slow the spread of coronavirus cases while vaccination of the population progresses.The SNP leader warned just before Christmas that the country was facing a virus that spreads #much faster# than it did in March.She added that the government was considering whether the current level four restrictions covering mainland Scotland, which were #not as stringent as the March lockdown#, would be #sufficient# to tackle the spread of the new, faster-spreading iant of the virus.Under level four restrictions, which were intended to be in place for three weeks from Boxing Day, non-essential shops have had to shut while bars, cafes and restaurants are only allowed to provide takeaway services.We take a look back at some of the measures introduced during the March lockdown, and statements made by the Scottish Government in recent days, to assess what further action could be announced on Monday.Under the current regulations, people must keep journeys within their own local authority area to an #absolute minimum#.The stay at home advice is currently guidance but speaking just before Christmas, the first minister said this could be backed up by law in a move similar to spring time.In March, stringent limits were put in place which meant people could only leave their homes to shop for #permissable reasons#.These included:Under the level four regulations, people must, by law, remain within their local authority area unless they have a reasonable excuse to travel to another.This includes for work purposes, for school or for healthcare.In a statement released on Sunday, the first minister urged the public to stay at home #as much as possible# and to #avoid non-essential interactions with other households#.Schools were due toto face-to-face learning on January  but Ms Sturgeon said last week that this was under review.Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the government#s education recovery group will meet on Monday morning in advance of cabinet to consider the current advice in relation to schools and learning.It is expected that tomorrow#s announcement will almost certainly mean a further delay to theof schools into February.Speaking on Wednesday, the first minister said she wanted to osee schoolsnormally on January  as planned but would be assessing the #up to date situation# over the next few days.She added thatthere were any changes these would be set out #as early as possible# to give parents and teachers #as much notice as possible#.From Boxing Day, all of mainland Scotland was placed into level four restrictions, with the islands moving to level three.Shetland, which remains in level three currently, was facing a potential move to level four restrictions after a recent wave of Covid- infections.One of the options which remains available to ministers is to introduce a nationwide lockdown, similar to March, in which every part of country is under the same stringent measures.No one in Scotland is permitted to visit other households indoors but there are exemptions for those who have formed extended households, to support informal childcare arrangements and for couples who do not live together.Under current restrictions, a maximum of six people from two separate households can meet outdoors in a private garden or in a park.During the first lockdown in March, it was not permitted to meet up with other households even outdoors.Shielding was initially put in place in March to protect those at greatest risk of severe complications from coronavirus from contracting the virus.The national advice to shield has ended and those who were in that category should follow the same advice as everyone  in their local council area#s protection level.Even in level four areas, there are no restrictions on socially distancing from people in the same household and it is possible to do unlimited amounts of exercise.The Scottish Government has said in its guidance that #small changes# to the infection rate will not affect this advice.However, they said people within this category may be asked to take #extra steps# to stay safethere is #an increase in infection rates that gives us concern#.Should this happen, the Scottish Government will inform iniduals of this via a letter and through the text messaging service.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Naturally, this would not be the last time an IndyRef would be brought up this year.On January , the UK confirmed its first two cases of Covid-.FebruaryBy February , the forthcoming coronavirus pandemic seemed a million miles away ndash with only three cases confirmed by this point.Attention instead was on Storm Ciara ndash a powerful and long-lived cyclone which battered parts of the country with gusts of up to mph.Flooding and heavy wind caused damage to buildings and train services, and on February , a -year-old man died after falling on icy surfaces and banging his head during the storm.Another major news story to unfold in the last year was surrounding former finance secretary Derek Mackay MSP.Once tipped to become the next First Minister, the Scottish Sun revealed the now shamed politician had been pestering a -year-old schoolboy on social media.The paper reported the -year-old MSP had contacted the boy out of the blue without knowing his age the previous August, then sent him  messages over six months.MarchThen came March ndash a month that can only be described as the month coronavirus pandemic really hit home in Scotland.On March , Scotland had its first confirmed case of the virus in the NHS Tayside, followed soon after by its first death on March .By March ,  cases had been confirmed in the country, with the virus clearly beginning to spread into other health boards.The inevitable news then came ndash with all pubs, cafes and restaurants being forced to close on March , before a nationwide lockdown on March .On the same day, Alex Salmond was cleared of sexually assaulting nine woman while he was the First Minister.As the BBC reports, a jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on  of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.A further charge of sexually assaulting a th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors. Throughout the trial, Mr Salmond said he was innocent of all charges.On March , Clap For Carers was launched - coined up as a way to show appreciation for those on the NHS and other frontline services during the pandemic.The event saw people taking to their doorsteps and windows at pm every Thursday to clap, cheer, ring bells and play bagpipes to show their support.The last formal clap took place on May , followed by an extea Clap for NHS on July  marking the nd anniversary of its establishment.AprilOn April , the Queen made a rare broadcast to the UK and wider Commonwealth, in which she thanked people for following social distancing rules and said the UK ldquowill succeed in its fight against the coronavirus.Echoing the words of Vera Lynnrsquos wartime song, she added ldquoWe will meet again.On the same day, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dt Catherine Calderwood resigned after facing intense criticism for breaking lockdown rules twice to visit her second home during the pandemic.Dr Calderwood concluded with the First Minister that her position was untenable given the need for consistent and trustworthy public health messaging.Sticking with the pandemic, all eyes were on -year-old war veteran Tom Moore on April , who raised millions of pounds for NHS charities for walking more than  laps of his garden.In less joyful news, just four days later on April , Scotlandrsquos new temporary coronavirus hospital the NHS Louisa Jordan opened to receive Covid patients.MayOn May , Boris Johnsonrsquos senior advisor Dominic Cummings faced calls to resign after an investigation alleged he travelled  miles from London to his parentrsquos home in Durham while displaying coronavirus symptoms during lockdown.On May , Cummings held a press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden, in which he said: ldquoI donrsquot regret what I did.

UK citizens will be allowed to stay in the EU for  days in any -day period without a visa, and the same will apply for EU citizens in the UK.The European Commission says the choice to end free movement ldquoinevitably means that business travel between the EU and the UK will no longer be as easy as it currently is.People heading from the UK for business have been told by the Government to check the requirements of the country they are travelling to.British passport holders will no longer be able to use the EU passport queue at airports and other borders.Will I need a visa for my holiday From , you will have to purchase a pound visa-waiver for holidays and short stays.UK nationals will not need a visa for short trips to EU countries theyre just going on holiday.But they will have to pay for a visa-waiver ndash this will cost euroand will be issued under the European Travel Information and Authorisation System.Can I work in the EU From  onwards you may need extra documents to work or study, or for trips longer than  days.Details of this have yet to be confirmed and it will likely depend on what you are doing and where you are going.But those going to work or study abroad, plus those just going on business trips, might be affected from January , , onwards.Will I need a blue passport No, your current passport is still eligible.Pre-Brexit, you could travel to EU countries on your passport right up to the point it expires ndash and that willcontinueto be the case this year, and will be until the end of the transition period on December .However, next year, the rules are changing.These changes were announced prior to the trade deal and arent expected to be affected by it.Under the new rules, fromJanuary , , when you visit most EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, your passport will need to have at least six months left on it until expiry and be less than ten years old on the day you travel.Will security change The UK will lose access to a iety of key EU databases - used by the police- covering things such as criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.However, the UK will still have access to other systems which include cross-checks on fingerprints across Europe. This means that security co-operation will no longer be on ldquoreal-time access.The UK and the EU have reached an agreement on extradition, and the UKs role in Europol, the cross-border security agency, allows it to sit in on meetings but not have a direct say in decisions.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"absolutely confident\" the deal \"protects our police co-operation, protects our ability to catch criminals and to share intelligence across the European continent in the way that we have done for many years\".What about fishing The value of fish being caught by the EU in UK waters will be reduced by % and will be phased into transition over a five-and-a-half-year period.Once the transition period is over, the UK will fully control access to its waters and could make much deeper cuts.What is the impact on EU citizens living in the UK While Brexit affects everyone in the UK, the most immediate direct impact is on the . million people living here who are citizens of other EU countries.If you are a European Economic Area or Swiss citizen living in Britain, you wont have to leave the UK because weve left the EU.

it became the latest stateside firm to attempt to tap into the UK sector.MGMrsquos pound. billion proposal, which was swtly turned down by Entainrsquos board, is seen as a move to help rapidly expand its sports betting business.It comes after a period of rapid growth for the sports betting and online gambling industries in the US.Entain has this morning issued a statement in response to press speculation regarding proposals from MGM Resorts International, its partner in the US market, concerning a possible offer for Entain: https:t.co ADmhBqHhgmmdash EntainJanuary , MGMrsquos casino-owning rival Caesars has already made its own move to expand in this area by snapping up a UK betting giant.In November, shareholders approved Caesarsrsquos pound. billion takeover of William Hill, in a move which is expected to complete by March.Why the sudden growth in the US betting industry In the US, the casino-focused gambling sector had been stagnant for the best part of a decade after the  financial crisis, which squeezed tightly on consumer spending.Since , federal law had banned all but a few states, including Nevada, from promoting gambling on sporting events.But the US betting industry received a shot in the arm in , when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of New Jersey, home to gambling hub Atlantic City, in its y bid to introduce sports betting.The ruling placed the decision of whether to allow wagering on competitive games firmly in the hands of state legislatures, sparking a raft of other states to follow suit.As of November ,  US states had legalised sports betting with bills going through courts in a host of others.How did UK betting companies react to this William Hill entered the US in , acquiring three betting firms, to grow in the Nevada sports betting sector.It expanded its US business further following the  ruling and secured a % investment from Caesars into its US operations, prior to the casino giantrsquos full takeover bid.vw,vw,px, px\"A branch of William Hill, Ludgate Hill, in central London Entain, then known as GVC Holdings, started  with three state licences in the US, before the legislative change also allowed for its steady growth.The company also set up a number of partnership contracts with US casinos, racecourses and gaming venues, including a deal to supply technology to MGM casinos.Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment runs a raft of betting partnerships in the US, including its Fox Bet  which it runs with the US media giant.Last month, Flutter agreed a pound. billion deal to take % control of US based fantasy sports and online betting firm FanDuel.What obstacles still exist The largest obstacle for US betting firms disappeared with the  Supreme Court ruling, but smaller obstacles still remain on a state-by-state basis.Some states, such as North Carolina, have rules requiring betting to take place in person at specic retail locations, hampering the growth of online betting.In other, such as Virginia, online betting is allowed, but is not permitted on college sports or youth sporting events.As of November, only three states remained where no sports betting is allowed.Idaho and Wisconsin have not had any publicly announced bills devoted to sports betting legislation.Meanwhile, Utah has its anti-gambling stance written into its state constitution, banning everything from gambling on horse-racing to lottery tickets.What makes UK firms particularly appealing MGM is among the US gambling firms to focus their growth ambitions on the rapidly expanding online market, with it investing one billion dollars into its digital operations last year.The UK, which has typically had much more relaxed gambling laws, is one of the most mature online gambling markets.A decade of strong growth in the sector has put UK firms at the height of technological developments.US firms struck partnerships with UK firms in  to quickly access their technology when the ruling allowed for expansion but the impact of the pandemic on UK stock prices has made it a ripe opportunity for takeover moves.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said MGM and Caesarsrsquos bids for UK firms show they are ldquodesperate to add to their online footprint at a time when the pandemic is undermining business in their resorts and casinos..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga,

serious.ldquoWe have to make the right decisions to keep people safe and thatrsquos why I am suggesting thata risk assessment is carried out in a school, and it is not safe to open that school, then

decision was announced while his fiancee, Stella Moris, with whom he has two young sons, wept, before she was embraced by WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson.The US government has given notice it will appeal the decision and has two weeks to lodge grounds, while Assange has been remanded in custody ahead of a bail application.He is wanted to face an -count indictment, alleging a plot to hack computers and a conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information.The case followed WikiLeaksrsquo publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents in  and  relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, as well as diplomatic cables.Prosecutors say Assange helped US defence analyst Cha Manning breach the Espionage Act in unlawfully obtaining material, was complicit in hacking by others, and published classied information that put the lives of US informants in danger.

Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes a miss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.The events that Scotlandrsquos festive season are famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online. It will bring to le an exciting new piece of writing by award-winning poet and Scots Makar, Jackie Kay, creating Scotlandrsquos first-ever large-scale drone show and the largest drone show ever seen in the UK.Around  drones will create iconic images and words in the Scottish sky set to original words and music by Jackie Kay and Skyersquos Niteworks.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

Its right now, its happening, andwe dont sort out how we deal with the planet, were in big trouble.Do you have a favourite scene from A Perfect Planet \"I have to say, that flamingo sequence is one of the most memorable sequences Ive seen on television. Shot under extraordinarily dficult circumstances... its impossible not to identy with these poor little chicks who have to make it from the middle of this appalling lake to the edge to get away from their nest in the centre.\"Can we expect more ground-breaking cinematography \"It has been filmed so beautully, the use of drones, that is to say cameras which can take you up into the sky, and see whatever you want to see, its so skilful. And the pictures are so indelibly planted on the mind, thats what I think about actually on the whole series. My goodness, its extraordinary.\"Does climate change remain the biggest threat to the planet \"If we warm the earth to such a degree that the Arctic melts, every city in the world - every big city in the world, very nearly, will be underwater. A high proportion of the important cities in the world are built around the coast because of their ports andthe ice -the northern Arctic melts, the seas are going to rise and flood those cities.\"Thats not imagination, thats not H.G.Wells, its not science-fiction, its going to happen and we have still got a chance to stop it happening. What we have to do to persuade people thats the case... You have to say theres a very strong element in the United States that does not believe it - including the past president.\"What small change can people make that will have a big impact \"Not waste. Thats what they can do - and thats what theyll be forced to do, really. I mean, it is extraordinary how much we do waste at Christmas, simply on wrapping paper - Im as guilty as anybody. The chap who collects the refuse from this house would, Im sure, say, the amount of paper he throws away is awful - and thats true. But the sort of lush extravagance of Christmas, perhaps, is out of place at this particular moment.\"Do you feel a responsibility to educate people using the  youve created \"I sort of mistrust too much personality. Im embarrassed by my own, every time Im referred to. And Im sure that Greta [Thunberg] would actually say the same. But, its the way of things, there have to be people that speak.\"We understand why it is that a personal statement is more powerful than one thats an abstract statement or one thats not backed up... Gretas very good on this - Greta says all the time, its not me, it is the science, it is the science we must listen to and the scientists, and I absolutely agree.\"Is it frustrating to see people in power ignoring your warnings \"Rome wasnt built in a day and the whole world hasnt suddenly changed overnight, but I think in fact people are more aware internationally of the natural world as a consequence of what weve been going through than the reverse. I think thats the case.\"How did you handled lockdown restrictions \"Im very lucky. I dont have a huge garden, I dont want you to think I live on an estate. Ive got a reasonable garden and it has a pond. Since Ive lived here - which is  years, something like that, I cant remember taking three walks a day in my garden, as I did almost every day this spring.\"Did it make you more aware of the nature around you \"I was more aware this spring of flowers opening, buds forming, birds arriving, than Ive ever been, because Ive been busy - and most are.

If a week is a long time in politics it is an aeon on television. The programme that originally replaced Scotch and Wry was as ready for the Fran and Anna Retirement Home as Still Game had been before it.What we came for, what we always came for in good years and bad, were Watsonrsquos impressions of the big names, of King Kenny, Sir Alex, and the first grade wallopers, led by Frank ldquoWherersquos the burdz  McAvennie. All, with the absence of Fergie, came to praise Watson for getting them just right, from McAvenniersquos child-like gleeto Sounessrsquos rather more tight-lipped testimonial There was a minibus full of well-kent BBC faces, from Cosgrove and Cowan to a new double act of Muriel Gray and Kirsty Wark , both of whom attested to Only An Excusersquos legendary ability to attract women viewers who did not give a free kick about football.As Sir Kenny said, ldquoEverybody took it in good nature. It was just fun. If you cannae laugh at yourself yoursquove got a problem, havenrsquot you Only an Excuse was indeed Scotland laughing at itself for the good stuff - the fitba craziness, the sentimentality, the inextinguishable dreams of greatness regained.Here and there, it had bravely broached the ugly stuff as well, sectarianism chief among them. The spoof of the Cadbury ad featuring a gorilla, Phil Collinsrsquo In the Air Tonight, and ldquoSons of Larkhall drum, repeated last night, still took the breath away with its daring. This was genuinely courageous comedy, the kind of material that fearful types stayed away from lest it resulted in hassle in the street . Only an Excuse got away with it because it gave both Celtic and Rangers pelters with equal gusto.If there had been more of this edgier material the show might have lasted longer. But this is the age of Frankie Boyle and Charlie Brooker, the take no prisoners era. Satire should not be greeted warmly by the world it lampoons. You would never catch David Steel, for instance, praising the depiction of himself in Spitting Image as a little squirt in David Owenrsquos jacket pocket, or Norman Tebbit loving his ldquoskinhead look.For the most part, Only an Excuse was happy to be a pal to football and Scottish society in general. The same auld face that came round every Hogmanay was proof that while nothing stood still - he died, she moved away, the grand weans came along - some things would always remain the same.At the centre of it all was Watson, Scottish comedyrsquos strongest man, the performer who carried the show almost single handedly for more than a quarter of a century. Like some mad chef he reduced footballrsquos famous faces to their essence and watched as we dunked in our bread and soaked it up. It is time he moved on.Time, too, for Only an Excuse to come to a close. As we were reminded in the last episode, the new face of Scottish sport is more likely to be young and female rather than middle-aged and male. Scotland needs fresh comedy, material that reflects a changing nation, although for heavenrsquos sake let us always retain the ability to laugh at ourselves.By hourrsquos end it was time to get the collective coat and head off towards the bells.

The value of spending time with, and giving support to families, friends and neighbours has hit home for many, as has a renewed recognition of the wider degree to which we are all dependent on many others.That is a reminder, too, of our continuing responsibility to protect others by following the rules. It is likely to be months yet before a degree of normality s. Adjustments to how and where we work and the ways in which we interact with others will be required.In the wider public sphere, the past year has been a salutary lesson in the importance of transparency, clarity and consistency from those to whom we lend our trust to exercise authority. That has too often been a deficiency over the course of this disease, and it has unnecessarily compounded the dficulties of dealing effectively with it.It is not merely that, with hindsight, it is possible to identy catastrophic decisions, such as the release of patients into care homes without testing. We accept that the governments in Holyrood and at Westminster were dealing with an unprecedented situation and that mistakes were inevitable while much was unknown. It is also clear that ndash whatever criticisms there are to be made about the handling of the crisis ndash politicians demonstrated unanimity in declaring that their policies would be made on pragmatic grounds, in line with expert advice.But that sincerity of intent, alas, was not always translated into effective messaging. It is precisely when a number of approaches are possible, and when there is conflicting advice, that it is inadequate merely to assure the public that policy is ldquofollowing the science. The rationale, the projections and, wherever possible, the data behind decisions needs also to be transmitted in a clear fashion.For all the slide presentations and daily press conferences, there was far too much confusion. The pretence that tiers in dferent nations, ldquocircuit-breaking lockdowns, and other measures were substantially dferent from earlier restrictions may have been designed to reassure, or to suit the rules to local conditions.But in the end, it proved at best a recipe for confusion at a time when people were already inclined to chafe at continued privations. At worst, it gave some an excuse for deliberately misunderstanding the rules, as did occasions when politicians and officials north and south of the Border failed to observe rules that they themselves had imposed.Even with the realistic prospect that vaccination will halt or signicantly reduce the lethal damage that Covid has wrought, these issues will remain major challenges for government in the months, and probably for years, to come. Other areas, such as the enormous economic cost, will need to be addressed, in the words of the hymnrsquos later verse, ldquofree from error and hypocrisy.The decision of the SNP at Westminster to vote against a Brexit deal, having endlessly argued that any deal was better than none, is an example of the sort of petty partisan point-scoring that undermines efforts to rebuild. That is a shame, when the national interest ndash for nationalists and unionists alike ndash is at stake. The huge task of supporting the recovery of business, education and other fields must not be marked by the dither, delay and opacity that marked too many decisions last year, nor manipulated for party advantage.

The killing of deer by their proper predators would be good for the herd in the longer term, with many wider benefits to the environment.

She then published a new Independence Referendum Bill.In March , the day before Article  on leaving the EU was passed by Parliament, the First Minister formally requested the consent of Westminster to hold a referendum on Scottish independence. Theresa May said: ldquonow is not the time. The SNP lost a third of its seats in the  snap election that followed.Undaunted, she unveiled a ldquoreset timetable for indyref  which was now scheduled for the autumn of . When that didnrsquot happen she moved the dial to the autumn of , but before that date the SNP switched to supporting a Peoplersquos Vote for Brexit instead of indyref. That didnrsquot happen either. Indeed, the Peoplersquos Vote turned into a Tory General Election landslide of December . A triumphant Boris Johnson announced that he was now Minister for the Union and would reject a Scottish independence referendum for ldquoa generation.Sturgeonrsquos latest forecast is for a referendum in the first half of the new Scottish parliamentary cycle ndash meaning sometime around . You might think that after all these  dawns, independence supporters would have lost hope ndash but not a bit of it. After every deadline has been missed, support for independence has eventually ticked up.More voters than ever appear to have been convinced that Scotland should be an independent country. Some  polls have shown a majority for Yes, reaching a peak of  per cent in a Savanta ComRes poll in mid-December.Of course, that poll excluded donrsquot knows, and all recent polls have been conducted under the shadow of Brexit and latterly the pandemic. It is dficult to know just how much of this is actual support for independence and how much is down to loathing of Boris Johnson and Brexit. However, any objective assessment of the polling evidence would have to conclude that independence is gradually becoming the settled will of the Scottish electorate.This doesnrsquot mean a referendum is in the bag or even that it will certainly take place. Personally, I think the odds of a legally-binding referendum being held in the next decade are fairly remote. This is because the Conservatives now have a very solid majority in Westminster, despite losing a raft of Scottish MPs in .Boris Johnson is triumphant after his Brexit deal and will argue that there is no justication for holding a ldquoisive referendum to break up Britain at the very moment the UK is going through the complex process of rebuilding after the twin shocks of Covid and Brexit.The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is also of this view. He is promising further devolution instead of a referendum and has enlisted one of the stars of the  Better Together campaign, the former PM Gordon Brown, to front it. That is the surest sign that, unlike Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer is not prepared to flirt with independence.So, eventhe SNP win the expected landslide in the May Scottish elections, the prospect of Westminster agreeing a legally binding referendum on Scottish independence is remote.Nor will there be much enthusiasm in Brussels for Scottish secession, now that a Brexit deal is in place. Those politicians in the European Parliament who had been saying theyrsquod changed their minds about Scottish independence were mostly playing a tactical game to discredit Brexit. Countries like France and Spain are as resolutely opposed to ldquoseparatism as ever, and are not going to allow Brussels to get involved in the internal politics of a country no longer in the European Union.Nicola Sturgeon has always said that the independence referendum has to be ldquobeyond legal challenge ndash in other words, expressly authorised by Westminster through a Section  Order.She is not interested in declaring UDI after a General Election victory or staging a wildcat referendum of the kind held by Catalonia in . That led to the incarceration of many of the referendum organisers and the self-exile of the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont.The First Minister is the queen of caution. But that doesnrsquot mean shersquoll do nothing. Her personal popularity has never been higher following her handling of the pandemic, and the SNP has a commanding lead in the opinion polls. The FM is fully aware of just how dficult it is to win an absolute majority in a proportional parliament.But she will probably secure the support of the Greens at Holyrood for a referendum.So what happens then  Joanna Cherry MP, one of the stars of the anti-Brexit court actions, hopes that she will take on the Westminster Government in the Supreme Court,Boris refuses to accept the Scottish Governmentrsquos ldquomandate for a referendum.It is clear, under the UK constitution, that Holyrood has no power to hold a legally binding referendum on independence, but that doesnrsquot mean it canrsquot hold a consultative or advisory ballot asking the Scottish people what they want.There is a chance that the courts would agree that Holyrood has the power to hold a nationwide opinion poll.But would that make any dference  The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, is promising to boycott any such advisory referendum and is calling on Unionists not to participate in it. Even some supporters of independence might think that now is just the wrong time to be holding a isive referendum. It could lead to a repeat of the Catalan situation in  when their referendum was condemned as unrepresentative because unionist voters refused to vote.Nationalists might say: a votersquos a vote andpeople donrsquot take the opportunity of expressing a view they canrsquot complain about the result.But it is not Holyrood they need to convince but Westminster. Boris Johnson would use a half-baked referendum result to rule out a referendum even more emphatically than before, and Keir Starmer would back him.We are in a strange limbo, therefore. There is no obvious reason to expect a Scottish referendum in the near future and yet almost everyone does. There is no politically plausible route. However, politics is very fluid right now. We live in turbulent times.Support is clearly rising and it may be that a mass movement of Scottish opinion exerts moral pressure on the Westminster establishment to change its mind.

The field of play looks unremittingly bleak for Scotlandrsquos unionists. That assessment is not based solely on the headline polling numbers, grim as they are .It is what lies beneath that should worry unionists most. In the first referendum, in , the No vote relied on those with good jobs, good prospects and some money in the bank. Not so now Yes has a handsome lead over No in the ABC social class groupings, according to all pollsters.Gender has historically played a role in independence voting intentions, with women thought to be more risk-averse, and tending towards a No vote. No more women now lead with every pollster, in some cases by double-digits.The age profile of No voters is one of those ldquolook away now moments for unionists No leads only in the age group nearing retirement or older. Less than one-in-five under s will vote No. Should the referendum take place in , for the sake of argument, those aged six at the  referendum will be eligible to vote. Current patterns suggest almost all of them will vote Yes.There is no inevitability about this, though. The situation has arisen, in my opinion, largely as a result of push-factors rather than pull-factors. In other words, some of those who would previously have voted No have switched to Yes because of negativity towards the UK rather than positivity towards Scotland.Brexit  Boris  Covid  Probably all three, and probably a whole lot of other reasons. It is important. Many potential Yes voters are not emotional nationalists rather, they are pragmatically and clinically assessing le in an independent Scotland as being, on balance, better than le in the UK.He or she who is pushed away can be pulled back. But it will require the UK Government and its ruling Tories to make a series of radical changes which they have thus far shown themselves unwilling to do, or unable to do, or perhaps both.Truthfully, I donrsquot knowthey have it in them. I read an article at the weekend on a prominent Conservative blog in which the writer surmised that Scottish MPs could be made to like being at Westminster so much that independence could be stopped in its tracks. It was yet another ldquoDo these guys have any idea  moments, of which I experience many.There is a dference between unionist leaders and nationalist leaders. Nationalist leaders, unlike their foot soldiers, are clinical rather than emotional. They make decisions and create policy which they may personally find unpalatable, and which their supporters certainly do, because they know it will help them win Unionist leaders, on the other hand, are as emotional as the foot soldiers. They spend their time bleating about lsquoour precious Unionrsquo and concocting ious plans for how a referendum can be avoided that they never ask themselves the question: how are we going to win If they ever get around to doing so, they will understand that the answer is: by doing things we donrsquot like.The central tenet of what should become the new  of the UK Government is a great programme of decentralisation.

It also raises several questions which Ms Sturgeon really needs to answer in , especiallyshe wants to attract more sceptical voters to her cause.This is a particularly frustrating tendency of the First Minister and many other nationalists: the idea that Scotland is uniquely dferent to other nations. Ms Sturgeon says in her article that ldquoScotland, like all nations, is unique, but what does that literal fact prove If Scotland was unique in any profound political sense, we would need a unique political system, but Scotland is largely the same as its neighbours: it faces the same problems, the same issues, the same challenges, and thatrsquos why we cede some of our sovereignty.:Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish independence has never been about separatismMs Sturgeon accepts this when she talks about the EU, so why doesnrsquot she accept it when she talks about the UK A tactic used by the SNPis to state something which is not proven and to state it frequently, loudly, and repeatedly. ldquoDevolution is under threat. ldquoA referendum will happen next year. ldquoIndependence is inevitable. And now: ldquothe majority of Scots support independence.Ms Sturgeon does it again in her article. ldquoA consistent majority of people in Scotland, she says, ldquonow say they are in favour of becoming an independent country even though we cannot knowthatrsquos true or not. The polls show a majority of those who express an opinion now support independence, but thatrsquos not the same as a majority of Scots. Around % of those questioned say they donrsquot know and you donrsquot need great statistical skill to realise % could swing the result.:Opposition needed to challenge the SNP on Scottish independence says Tony BlairSo, the question is: why is Nicola Sturgeon saying it anyway, that the majority of Scots support independence  And the answer is shersquos saying it in the hope of bringing about a three-stage process. Stage one: we believe it. Stage two: we accept it. Stage three: we support it. Itrsquos happened before and it can get parties over the line.Nicola Sturgeon loves the V word: values. The founding values of the EU, she says, are dignity, freedom, equality, the rule of law andrespectfor human rights, and these are Scotlandrsquos values too, she says. She also writes that ldquounfortunately for those of us in Scotland, we are hellip at the sharp end of a very dferent project, driven by very dferent values: Brexit.But what is she suggesting here exactly  Is she suggesting the other nations of the UK ndash specically England ndash do not support values such as dignity and freedom  If so, thatrsquos a pretty outrageous thing to say and a rather unjustied example of Scottish moral superiority. My question would be: in what way exactly are Englandrsquos values dferent from Scotlandrsquos  And in what way are ldquoScotlandrsquos values not universal values In some ways, this is the most important question because it goes to the heart of the intellectual inconsistency of a party that supports leaving the UK and joining the EU. Ms Sturgeon says that more and more people in Scotland believe our aspirations can best be met by contributing to the shared endeavour and solidarity of the EU.:Boris Johnson doubles down on once in a generation referendum claimBut what is the dference between a shared endeavour between Scotland and its neighbours across the Channel, and a shared endeavour between Scotland and its neighbours on the same island  The other obvious question is how the First Minister could justy continuing to promote independence the UK was more federal. Scotlandrsquos membership of a completely federalised UK would not, in any material respect, be dferent to Scotlandrsquos membership of the EU. In both cases, decision-making is pooled on some subjects and we do not always get our way.As she makes clear in her article, Ms Sturgeon accepts this shared-sovereignty model when talking about the EU ndash indeed, she appears to be in love with it ndash but when the same principles are applied to the UK, itrsquos a dferent story. In her article, she also suggests an independent Scotland would be a ldquobridge to aid understanding between the EU and the UK. Itrsquos the best joke in the article.The final question is the most tricky one in a way, strategically, for the First Minister. She says Scotland is the victim of a ldquohard Brexit and that there will be disruption in the short term and new barriers in the longer term. But you can sense the strain in this part of the article, and for obvious reasons.The first problem is thatyou say something will be a disaster before it happens, some people will believe you, but you canrsquot go on saying itthe disaster doesnrsquot happen. Most Scots will not notice any changes post-Brexit andthey do, theyrsquoll be small, and thatrsquos undoubtedly going to neuter the ability of the SNP to carry on catastrophising. Itrsquos why you can hear the slight beep-beep of a reverse from the First Minister and the downgrading of her language to phrases like ldquoshort-term disruption.The second problem is that Ms Sturgeonrsquos desire for a softer Brexit highlights the inconsistency running through her outlook. She is desperate to cede sovereignty to one union but take it back from another, and for many voters thatrsquos confusing. Such as Scots who voted Yes in  and Leave in . Or Scots who voted No in  and Remain in . Or Scots who are desperate for a coherent internationalist philosophy. Or even Scots who started  with a resolution, quickly broken, to be less grumpy.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Assange denies plotting with Manning to crack an encrypted password on US Department of Defence computers and says there is no evidence that anyonersquos safety was put at risk. vw,vw,px, px\"Julian Assangersquos partner, Stella Moris His lawyers had said he faced up to  years in jailconvicted, although the US government said the sentence was more likely to be between four and six years.Assange has been held in high security Belmarsh prison since he was carried out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London by police before being arrested for breaching his bail conditions in April .The defence legal team argued that the US prosecution is political and said Assange, who has been diagnosed with Aspergerrsquos syndrome and severe depression, is a high suicide riskhe is extradited.Assange, who sat in the dock of Court  in a blue suit and wearing a green face mask below his nose, closed his eyes repeatedly as the judge read out her ruling, rejecting a string of defence arguments, including freedom of speech and that the prosecution was politically motivated.She said: ldquoIf the allegations are proved then the agreement with Ms Manning and other groups of computer hackers took him outside any role of investigative journalism.ldquoHe was acting to further the overall objective of WikiLeaks to obtain protected information by hacking,necessary. vw,vw,px, px\"Supporters of Assange celebrate outside the Old Bailey The judge said Assangersquos dealings with Ms Manning ldquowent beyond the mere encouragement of a journalist and that he was ldquowell aware of the danger to informants by disclosing unredacted names in leaked documents.But turning to his mental health she said: ldquoNotwithstanding the strong and constant support he received from his family and friends Mr Assange has remained either severely or moderately clinically depressed throughout his detention at HMP Belmarsh.She said there was a real risk he would be submitted to Special Administrative Measures and detained at the ADX Florence Supermax jailextradited.ldquoIrsquom satisfied that Mr Assange has the intellect and determination to circumvent suicide prevention measures, the judge said in her ruling.ldquoFaced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at HMP Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr Assange from finding a way to commit suicide and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental health and I order his discharge.Later, Assangersquos lawyer Ed Fitzgerald QC asked to put off a bail application until Wednesday.He said he wished to set out the current situation in Belmarsh jail where Assange has been held and stringent bail conditions which Assange could be subjected to to reassure the prosecution he would not abscond.Judge Baraitser agreed to a further hearing at Westminster magistratesrsquo court.Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

Primary pupils are to be taught remotely for the week from Monday until Friday, January  as the spread of coronavirus surges.Read MoreArlene Foster: Remote learning in Northern Ireland should be for short periodBut Mr McCamphill said all schools need to be closed until February to coincide with the current lockdown.There are two aspects to closing schools, he said. There#s the transmission that occurs in schools but then there#s the associated transmission, such as children travelling on buses and parents dropping children off.If we want the lockdown to be effective, andwe want to get Covid under control, we must take all the necessary steps otherwise our health system won#t be able to cope.Mr McCamphill said he was disappointed after Mrs Foster told the BBC that keeping children in school was a priority.The DUP leader said: We will do all that we can to keep pupils in school. We do recognise that with this new mutant version of Covid- there are dficulties and it transmits among younger people, and we have to take that into consideration.However, Mr McCamphill said the DUP “need to start listening to the scientic advice and acting on it”.His comments come after all four teaching unions in England said it was unsafe for schools to reopen and called for their closure for the next two weeks.But Boris Johnson said parents should send primary-age children back to schools that are open this week. The Prime Minister also said he has no doubt that classrooms are safe and that the risk to young people was very, very small.Mr Johnson told the Marr Show: Schools are safe. It is very, very important to stress that.I would advise all parents thinking about want to do, look at where your area is, overwhelmingly you#ll be in a part of the country where primary schools tomorrow will be open.Meanwhile, Northern Ireland nursery schools leaders have urged Mr Weir to treat them the same as their primary and secondary school counterparts.In a letter, the North and South Belfast Nursery Schools Principals Group urged him to hear the voices from the sector working on the ground in these unprecedented times.They added: We urge you to apply the same safety measures around delayed opening for primary school to all nurseries and preschools, thus enabling them to offer the same essential care for key workers and vulnerable children, to minimise contact and the spread of the virus.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"EducationWeir has failed thousands of pupils over transfer test, says Stormont Education Committee chair Chris LyttleThe chair of Stormont’s Education Committee has said the Education Minister has failed thousands of primary school children as they prepare to sit the first transfer test on Saturday.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandArlene Foster: Remote learning in Northern Ireland should be for short periodRemote learning for school children in Northern Ireland should only be for a short period, the First Minister has said.Most ReadHow Co Down couple breathed new le into historic #Frankenstein house# Castle WardBallymena Covid idiots throw New Year#s Eve street party just yards from police station Causeway chaos: Anger after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownWhere it all went wrong: Five reasons why Covid infections in Northern Ireland have soared to a record highHeartache as bride Jade Parker bride dies just two days after her weddingLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: UK#s first Oxford AstraZeneca Covid- vaccine administered to dialysis patient Brian PinkerNew sites to help ramp up vaccine programme as Oxford jab releasedCauseway chaos: Anger after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownTen-step plan to help you and your children cope with remote learning From studying Charles Parnell at am and online classes, to cancelled formals and exam stresses, four Northern Ireland students on the strangest school year everLatest from Belfast Leader of England’s biggest council calls on ministers to impose lockdownNumber of Covid cases ‘set to reach , per day’Foxes confident but not complacent – James Maddison lauds ‘brilliant’ away formEntain takeover bid: Why are UK betting firms in high demand stateside Post-primary transfer tests should not proceed – Deputy First Minister,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Kelvin BoyesRodney EdwardsTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNew Year#s Eve: inside Northern Ireland#s Nightingale Hospital in Belfast, there#s growing unease among medical professionals who may soon have to decide who lives and who dies.In seven days the region has had more than , positive cases, of which , affect the over-s. It is the largest increase in infection rates since the pandemic began last March.Yesterday it was announced , people have tested positive for Covid- in Northern Ireland over a -hour period, with  more deaths.Butthe figures keep rising, then the consequences are that hospitals like Nightingale may run out of critical care capacity and more people will die who did not have to, says Dr George Gardiner, the Covid facility#s ICU clinical director.As the virus spreads, people dying is an inescapable consequence he says, explaining it is entirely possible that at some stage we will have more patients than we can safely treat, and we are going to have to change the expectations of what we can achieve.Around , of those affected in the past week are aged between  and , while almost  are aged under . The hospitals are running at pc capacity for signicant periods of time, and ambulances are back parked up outside AE departments waiting for available beds.The frightening reality, says Gardiner, is the current trajectory does not bode well.When I have to make a really dficult decision -we get to the pointresources won#t go far enough - I hear no voice that says, #we support you in whatever decision you have to make, ethically or socially#. How do we decide which people get a longer time in critical care or who gets it in the first place He admits that conundrum keeps him up at night and is not a medical decision but a social, political and economic decision.Inside this hospital, there#s the constant ringing of alarms, the noise of the ventilators that are keeping patients alive and the arrival of more very sick people.Outside,  New Year#s Eve house parties that took place throughout Northern Ireland have been reported to PSNI officers, who issued  fines. But there may be many more undiscovered.We have  patients in ICU, with one more on the way, explains Gardiner. There is the potential of three to five coming here in the next  hours.Those partying while others are gravely ill are not only complicit in the spreading of the virus but forcing us against our will to make plans about who we can treat and who we can#t.Do those partying have blood on their hands  Utterly, he replies. You can taste the potential for victory against this disease and it would be an absolute travesty to screw it up at this stage.Over at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Dr Siobhan Quinn, an associate specialist in emergency medicine, says she and her colleagues are desperately trying to free up beds as, in some cases, up to seven ambulances wait outside while a nurse stands at the front door guiding paramedics.Over the last few days these poor patients were having to wait outside the emergency department and in some cases, they are anxious, worrying they have Covid.Then we get calls through about another standby and you have to make decisions quickly about who is the least sick person here so you can move them on, she explains.There will be more deaths, says undertaker David Brown of S D Brown in Lisburn, who believes the reality of failing to abide by the guidelines will not sink in until it comes to people#s doors.How bad is it  The first Sunday I visited the mortuary, there was one Covid in that week, the following Saturday it was six, the Sunday after there were  in there. This is just the start.The family of grandfather Andy Pinkerton , formerly of Crumlin in Co Antrim, who died with Covid- days before Christmas, know how serious the disease is. His son Gareth and Andy#s we of  years, Menai, had to watch him die through the window of his room at the Royal Victoria as they did not want to risk going inside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGareth Pinkerton and his mother could not be with his father when he died.

Photo: Kelvin BoyesWe were concerned about the disease and even beforehand we sat in the hospital car park debatingwe were right to go in or not, says Gareth.In the end, we looked at him through a window, we knew he wouldn#t have wanted us to risk it. Not having a chance to say goodbye, or to hold his hand when he died, was hard, he says.In Co Fermanagh, the Very Rev Kenneth Hall, the Dean of Clogher, cannot visit Covid patients in the hospital and instead has been forced to pray with the dying via video or telephone.Seeing someone lying on their death bed surrounded by medical staff all gowned up with a mask and visor and seeing, or maybe only hearing me, not in person, but through some form of technology has made it an exceptionally dficult time, he says.Often, Hall must ask doctors and nurses to sign the dying person with the sign of the cross as he gives the final blessing.We have underestimated, and often taken for granted the privilege of being able to be present at bedsides, to touch a person, to hold their hand and to comfort them in their hour of need… Covid- has taken that away from us, he says.The Department of Health said yesterday there were  confirmed Covid- patients in hospitals there, with  in ICU, of whom  were on ventilators.The question now is: could the current surge in cases have been avoided Dr Alan Stout, the chairman of Northern Ireland#s GP committee, was one of several medical professionals who warned political leaders of the ramications of not taking control of the disease before Christmas. He says healthcare workers are going to be struggling in the coming weeks because Northern Ireland did not go into lockdown sooner.We are seeing our cases increase dramatically because we are now in the third wave our hospitals are full and the implications of that over the next few weeks will be immense.We didn#t go into a lockdown hard enough or quick enough, says Stout. We were saying for weeks and weeks we needed to go into a hard lockdown… our already very high numbers are now only the tip of the iceberg, with worse to come.Sinn Féin MLA Pat Sheenan, a member of Stormont#s health committee, points the finger at the Department of Health, saying it has had no strategic plan in dealing with Covid- and is making it up on the hoof.There are people who are going to die who need not have died and there are people who have already died who need not have died and that#s because we haven#t had a proper strategy to deal with this it#s all been done on a wing and prayer, he said. But his own political party - and the Democratic Unionists - is continuing to be criticised after it emerged deep ision at the Executive table has hindered the response.Despite pledging to be united, the two main parties continue to be at loggerheads, say Executive sources, with Sinn Féin disagreeing with taking guidance from London and the DUP disagreeing to an all-island response.Politics has failed people throughout the pandemic, says the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.Political leaders failing to follow public health guidance, failing to wear masks and extraordinarily using cross-community vetoes to block Executive decisions has weakened our response.The situation is a national disgrace, says Derry-based Professor Deirdre Heenan of Ulster University.Our government is failing catastrophically at its primaryto protect people.It beggars belief that following the worst week since the pandemic began, there has been stony silence from Stormont, she says.Where is the reassurance that the government get the urgency of the situation  At a time of national crisis, where are the first minister, deputy first minister and chief medical officer She believes that it is unconscionable and outrageous that people are suffering and dying unnecessarily because of failures of political leadership, confused contradictory messaging, indefensible delays and inadequate planning.The story of this pandemic is politicians here who have never led nor been proactive and simply react when it#s too late. There is no sign of any leadership it is shameful, says Heenan.Most ReadHow Co Down couple breathed new le into historic #Frankenstein house# Castle WardBallymena Covid idiots throw New Year#s Eve street party just yards from police station Causeway chaos: Anger after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownWhere it all went wrong: Five reasons why Covid infections in Northern Ireland have soared to a record highHeartache as bride Jade Parker bride dies just two days after her weddingLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: UK#s first Oxford AstraZeneca Covid- vaccine administered to dialysis patient Brian PinkerNew sites to help ramp up vaccine programme as Oxford jab releasedCauseway chaos: Anger after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownTen-step plan to help you and your children cope with remote learning From studying Charles Parnell at am and online classes, to cancelled formals and exam stresses, four Northern Ireland students on the strangest school year everLatest from Belfast Footballers who broke coronavirus restrictions should know better – Troy DeeneyBelow-average temperatures to last all week, forecasters warnCovid- vaccine rollout in nursing homes gets under way this weekJulian Assange avoids extradition to United StatesInmates create nesting boxes for endangered birds,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After the most dficult of  months, Jon Tonge rates our ministers.Arlene Foster: First MinisterThis was the First Minister#s best year in a while, although that may damn with faint praise.Mrs Foster got her job back, devolution was restored, she sailed through the RHI inquiry report and earned praise even beyond her community for Covid consistency.Then her party bizarrely forced a cross-community vote against lockdown before agreeing to tougher restrictions within a fortnight. That at least united lockdown zealots and sceptics in anger and bafflement.Brexit yielded an Irish Sea border, and many blamed the DUP as midwives of their misfortune.Arlene nonetheless celebrated five years as DUP leader, most spent not dealing with Sammy Wilson or Edwin Poots.She was also confronted by the biggest rebellion in DUP history as  MLAs refused to support their leader on the Executive Functions Bill.Yet all the endless talk of leadership challenges remains just that - chatter. Foster remains the undisputed leader of unionism as her beloved country enters its centenary. Michelle O#Neill: Deputy First MinisterPaid a price for attending what seems the longest funeral in history, given the arguments it still attracts.Having survived a curious party leadership challenge from John O#Dowd in , the Deputy First Minister began the year promisingly. Sinn Fein#s quiet compromise on a standalone Irish Language Act helped facilitate New Decade, New Approach and theof Stormont.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMichelle O#NeillPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMichelle O#Neill Via existing legislation, Irish language provision was to be extended and a dedicated commissioner appointedO#Neill#s party got most of what it wanted, on terms nonetheless acceptable to the DUP. O#Neill#s pronouncements on the need for an all-island strategy to deal with Covid made good sense. But at the end of June came that funeral furore. This extended even beyond those whose views on republican commitments to public safety were shaped by an earlier era.We did not really miss the joint briefings from the First and Deputy First Minister. Loveless marriages on public show are not a great watch. But their absence symbolised the void in joined-up government. And no one was surprised when Michelle found  reasons why she was unable to attend Arlene#s big centenary party next year.For the Deputy First Minister, the hope is to seize the main office in . Sinn Fein#s strong performances in the South increase expectations, and pressure, on its northern leader. Robin Swann: HealthThe lockdown king had a strong year, commanding respect across the political spectrum. LucidTalk surveys showed most of the public backed tough Covid restrictions. Swann immunised Northern Ireland from the wildlyoptimisticus virus strain offered by the Prime Minister.The Health Minister must have had moments of regret at choosing the one job more taxing than his former role leading the UUP. Still, such experience helped with the crisis management.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRobin SwannMichael Cooper FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueRobin Swann Northern Ireland#s NHS crisis long pre-dated Covid, shocking testimony to the three-year absence of devolved government. Swann helped prevent total collapse and quickly settled the health workers# strike.Critics suggested Swann was optimism#s antidote. They criticised his early warning that , might die as alarmist, % beyond the actual toll. There remained concern over whether the Covid focus was at the expense of other treatments. Businesses raged against stop-start lockdowns. Van Morrison declined the invitation to the Swann Christmas household bubble. Ironically, Swann ended the year being criticised for being too soft in not imposing a travel ban from Britain.But overall, no one could accuse Swann of swerving science or ducking extraordinarily dficult challenges. Edwin Poots: AgricultureAppeared at times a masked version of Sammy Wilson in terms of lockdown scepticism and leadership challenges.In an extraordinary scientic breakthrough in October, Poots seemed to discover a mutant strain of the virus in which transmission in nationalist areas exceeded that in unionist communities by six to one.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEdwin Poots FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEdwin Poots When sticking to his agriculture brief, Poots is well regarded as a capable and often conciliatory minister who listens and engages. The DUP old-school veteran is on top of the issues and commands the respect of the farmers and the community he serves.Whatever Poots# aversion to some aspects of lockdown, there were no rule breaches amid the grief of the funeral of his father earlier this year.Ended a dficult year testing positive for Covid-. Peter Weir: EducationSometimes seemed so keen on keeping children in school at all costs you half-expected them to be in class on Christmas Day morning. But it#s a strange world when an Education Minister - or Under-fire Education Minister, to give Peter Weir his full title for most of the year - gets criticised for wanting children to go to school.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePeter Weir FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeter Weir Arguments over transfer test locations at least deflectedfrom the age-old battle about the tests themselves. Public opinion is evenly ided. Those whose kids are most likely to pass are most in favour of the tests, funnily enough. Such arguments will persist long beyond the DUP minister#s tenure.An Arlene loyalist, Weir deserves credit for wanting to keep education as normal as possible. He recognised that remote learning experiences y wildly and disadvantage most those in greatest need. Nonetheless, January classes in school look unlikely. Expect his decision to persist, with some GCSE and A-level examinations next summer to come under further pressure. Another climbdown seems likely. Nichola Mallon: InfrastructureThis ought to be one of the more attractive Executive posts, allowing strategic development. Yet the Covid grimness was so all-consuming that Mallon#s job became simply keeping the show on the road - literally in terms of transport services.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNichola Mallon FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNichola Mallon The SDLP#s solitary Executive presence, Mallon did good work in terms of liaising with those services andkeeping airports alive, but some taxi outfits remain close to collapse, even with rescue packages. Greener bus orders and Casement Park renewal were rare decisions beyond the crisis management. Naomi Long: JusticeNormally one of the adults in the room. Helped broker dficult Executive compromises on lockdown. A decade after policing and justice were devolved, the Alliance leader found herself dealing with a wide range of issues, ranging from Covid prison outbreaks to Gerry Kelly#s tweets.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNaomi LongPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNaomi Long After a mainly sure-footed stint, Long found herself embroiled in end-of-year rows over the funding of payments to Troubles victims and delays to much-needed reform of domestic abuse law.In party leadership terms, it was understandably a quieter year, obviously overshadowed by Covid and the absence of elections, after last year#s spectacular advances for Long#s party. Diane Dodds: EconomyAttempted valiantly to keep alive an economy potentially suffering more damage from lockdowns than  years of the Troubles. Appeared to be on a Save Ulster from Sobriety mission with a determined campaign to keep open hospitality.The Democratic Unionist Pubs advocate spent much of the year arguing against prohibition and those believing that requiring the purchase of chips with a pint warded off a virus.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDiane Dodds FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDiane Dodds By December, though, even Dodds seemed resigned to a lack of festive cheer, although she did get a retail voucher scheme approved to try and help beleaguered shops.The mass unemployment coming post-furlough will not be her fault..

This is about learning, not getting everything right first time, she said. It should be enjoyable for parents and their children. This is not something you need to do all day.Here are her tips for getting the most from remote learning:. Set a routine daily and stick to it. Try to keep it as close to the school routine as possible. Get the children up and dressed, breakfast as usual. Know what time lessons will begin and end. Remember that there are lots of children in a class so with one-to-one teaching they do not need to be working for seven hours a day.. Children thrive on routine and many in primary school follow a visual timetable. Create your own school timetable. In many primary schools pupils complete numeracy and literacy in the mornings and other subjects such as PE in the afternoon. Work out what is best for them.. Create a designated home learning space for your child away from all distractions. Turn off the TV and choose a space preferably at the kitchen table or,that has too many disruptions with other family members interrupting, a dining room table or a desk - not their bed! Set up this space with everything they need to learn and study.. Take breaks between lessons. Parents are the first educators of their own children. Engage in all the activities that your children love. Incorporate some material from school into their lessons but enjoy the time together painting, crafting, reading or even baking.. Reach out to the teacher. Follow the digital remote learning plan that will be sent to you. Keep communication channels free with your child#s class teacher. If you are unsure of something use the school#s chosen online s to communicate. Check the school#s website regularly for information.. Use online resources and make their use purposeful. Most schools have links to online learning on their school website. Make sure that you have the passwords for any apps the school has bought and your child can access their My School Ck learning. Use the iPad to visit educational apps and videos. YouTube has many tutorials of lessonsyou are unsure of something.. Prioritise your child children#s mental health. Be happy and try to stay motivated. Have so me designated time for mindfulness activities. Take the children outdoors as much as possible for active sessions outside or exploring nature.. Structure free time. Make time during the day to practise their musical instrument, play football or to watch TV.. If your child is reluctant to complete set tasks from their class teacher, explain to the teacher the dficulties you are having and devise a form of positive reinforcement together. The teacher may have a reward system that could be used for all the children in the class.. Keep a diary. You will not get this time back again and it is a living history lesson. Enjoy your time together and remember, this is one-to-one learning - your child will be used to being in a classroom of maybe - children.Belfast Most ReadBallymena Covid idiots throw New Year#s Eve street party just yards from police station How Co Down couple breathed new le into historic #Frankenstein house# Castle WardJim Corr#s claims over Margaret Keenan#s #fake# Covid vaccine blastedWhere it all went wrong: Five reasons why Covid infections in Northern Ireland have soared to a record highCauseway chaos: Anger after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownLatest Northern IrelandPost-primary transfer tests should not proceed – Deputy First MinisterYoung woman dies following west Belfast crashWe fought for her and in honour of all special needs children: Nora Quoirin family #utterly disappointed# by misadventure inquest verdictBelfast woman Lucy McIlhatton killed in Springfield Road crashCoronavirus Northern Ireland: UK#s first Oxford AstraZeneca Covid- vaccine administered to dialysis patient Brian PinkerLatest from Belfast Number of Covid cases ‘set to reach , per day’Foxes confident but not complacent – James Maddison lauds ‘brilliant’ away formEntain takeover bid: Why are UK betting firms in high demand stateside Post-primary transfer tests should not proceed – Deputy First MinisterQueen sends anniversary message to Woman’s Hour during Emma Barnett’s first show,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was also responsible for a time for looking after the club#s ball boys.But beyond football, Mr Hayes was well known for helping others cope with the trauma of organ transplants.Last night the Northern Ireland Ambassador for Kidney Care UK - former Assembly member Jo-Anne Dobson - spoke fondly of the man she described as a real gentleman.Noel was one of the people we in the kidney family all looked up to, she said.He had his transplant more than  years ago.What I loved was that he gave others - people who were perhaps facing a transplant operation - he gave them hope. Noel was so calm, so relaxed, so chilled, so matter-of-fact and unflustered. He was a calming influence. He would#ve done anything for anyone, said Mrs Dobson, who donated a kidney to her son, Mark.When I became NI Ambassador for Kidney Care UK - just before I gave my son a kidney three years ago - one of the first events I did was at Glenavon FC with Noel.If ever there was an example in inspiring people to dig deep to support other patients, that was Noel. He was the embodiment of le with a new kidney.People don#t know how long they are going to get out of a kidney transplant, and Noel was someone that we put on a pedestal - a man who had had  years plus with his transplant. Noel gave hope to others on that journey - that they could be like him and have that precious gt for a long time.He wasn#t afraid to muck in, wasn#t afraid to talk to anyone who was on a journey with kidney problems - he just had such a lovely calming way with him.He was a real gentleman.Speaking to the Belfastyesterday, Glenavon chairman Adrian Teer said it was a sad day for the club. Noel was a lelong Glenavon supporter, and had been involved with the club for many, many years, initially on the youth development side, and latterly as a member of the board.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue.

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on.     Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back from their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

At the end of the season, two from the first teams eliminated will meet in a play-off to stay in the senior championship. From the last five years, form will be assessed for wins, draws and defeats, as well as scoring totals to pick the two lowest performing teams, who will play in a relegation play-off. The loser will drop to intermediate, with the intermediate winners promoted to the senior grade.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’!     “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March.     The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lynn and Philip Hasson had arranged to get married in Donegals Redcastle Hotel in May, but the coronavirus outbreak halted their plans. The big day was rescheduled for November. However, as the date grew closer they were advised to move the celebrations to October in case lockdown restrictions got tighter again. When the ban on unnecessary cross-border travel came into force in early autumn, the couple were told they couldnt get married in the Republic. Undeterred, they rebooked their wedding at Derrys Beech Hill Country House in Ardmore at the end last month. googletag.cmd.push But on Wednesday, October , they got a call to say they would have to get married three days later, Saturday, October , before fresh lockdown measures came into play. After confirming that her son, Matthew, and his partner could make the wedding, Lynn gave it the go ahead. It was a bit crazy, I was working until .pm on the Thursday so we didnt have much time to pull it together, said Lynn, who is a support worker with Praxis Care. A host of Derry businesses pulled out all the stops to make sure the wedding could go ahead early and Lynn and Philip finally made it down the aisle. googletag.cmd.push We both have big families and lots of friends and we didnt want to leave anyone out so our initial wedding was for  people and ended up being for just  - including the bride and groom. In the end we only had close family and a few friends and they couldnt even bring their partners, but that was just the way it had to happen. There were a few people that couldnt come because they were isolating which was a pity.  Thankfully, Lynns two sons and Philips four children were able to attend. In the end it was very intimate and I stood back and looked and it was all the people that are closest to us which was lovely, said Lynn.     I was starting to think I was jinxed and in the run up to the wedding I was very nervous, but that day around lunch time all of a sudden I felt so, so relaxed. It was a brilliant day. And Lynn isnt resentful that she missed out on her big day As long as no one is sick then anything  is fixable, she said. I wouldnt want to be one of those families waiting on a phone call from the hospital. Lynn and Philp thanked everyone who made their last minute nuptials such a success. Wed like to say a special thank you to Aisling and Michael at the Redcastle who were excellent and gave us a full refund. To Jenny and James at the Beech Hill Country House for making everything run so smoothly and to Lisdale Signature Cars, Funky Cakes, Sass and Halo for the flowers, Natalie Doherty for the photography, Erin Gilroy for the make-up and Charlene Ferguson for the hair. And to my friend Anne Marie Boyle who did the balloons and decorations- she was my rock,” added the new bride.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This work has continued in recent weeks and the proposed way forward has been informed by the evidence and the advice provided. The common aim has been to keep schools safe, prioritise children’s education and ensure any impact on overall transmission is as low as possible, while accepting that schools reopening as normal is not sustainable. “While previous arrangements have been informed by the advice of the Department of Health, unfortunately the deteriorating nature of the epidemic and the risks to public health has necessitated more substantial changes.     “Therefore, having considered the advice from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Advisor and following discussions with them, I have decided that all primary and post-primary pupils will be taught remotely for the first week of term. Special schools and childcare provision will, however, remain open.  “All schools must provide supervised learning for vulnerable children and key workers’ children. “I must stress that these decisions are not made lightly as I know the negative impact on children’s learning and mental health and well-being of not being in school. However, particularly after unprecedented levels of positive Covid- tests since Christmas, and the pressure this applies to our health service, it is critical that we all must consider the public health and scientic advice as we look forward to brighter days ahead.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The vessel has become something of a local tourist attraction and has been compared to the Bad Eddie boat which washed up on a Donegal beach in  and has remained there since. The Donegal boat attracts a huge amount of visitors each year and has also featured in a video for a Clannad song.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Colette Rogers, Strategic Lead for Tobacco Control with the PHA, said: “During the COVID- pandemic, our health is more important than ever. Stopping smoking now will have a positive impact on your health, not only in the long-term, but also sooner in ways you probably hadn’t thought about. For example,you smoke, your fingers are in contact with your lips, increasing the possibility of transmission of COVID- from hand to mouth. “This has been a dficult year in lots of ways, but you can use the New Year as an opportunity to take a positive step to quit smoking and make use of our free support services to help. googletag.cmd.push “Due to the present COVID- situation we have put plans in place to ensure you can access PHA-funded Stop Smoking Services while still following social distancing guidelines,” said Colette. “This may include telephone contact or video calls as opposed to face-to-face support. These measures will ensure you can still access Stop Smoking Services in a manner which is safe and convenient for you.” Studies have shown that you are four times more likely to quit with help. Local Stop Smoking Services, nicotine replacement therapyand support from your family and friends can make all the dference when you are quitting, so make sure you are familiar with all the help available. googletag.cmd.push “We know quitting smoking isn’t easy and it can take several attempts for many people to quit for good, butyou are determined you can do it,” said Colette. “There is lots of help available to support you to quit. If you have tried to quit before and relapsed, accept it, work out why it happened, and focus on how you can avoid it happening again. If you found you have relapsed due to the dficulty and stress of the pandemic, remember the positives. You have quit before and you can do it again! “We would encourage people to take the time to look at our website at www.stopsmokingni.info.     As well as support and advice, you will find real le stories of people in Northern Ireland who have quit successfully. You can get insight from their experience and what has motivated them as you consider your smoke free choices this New Year.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books.

He had lived in London most of his le, leaving Saul at the age of .Engaged to be married, but struggling to find the right ring, he found himself back in Northern Ireland on business he decided to call on his uncle Will, his only surviving Irish relative.It was the eve of the longest night of the year, a few days before Christmas, and a bitterly cold late afternoon. On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door. She ripped of her shoe and attacked the window screen. She turned to Jim. lsquoWhat do you know about fixing cars rsquo Jim shrugged.The bride pierced him with fiery blue eyes.lsquoAre you going to a fancy dress party rsquo he asked. lsquoI am going to be married,rsquo she replied. She banged the roof of the car with her shoe a number of times, hopping about attempting to put the shoe back on to her foot. lsquoLet me give you a lt,rsquo suggested Jim.In order to steady herself the bride hung on to Jimrsquos shoulder and finally won the battle of the shoe. lsquoThought yoursquod never ask.rsquo She lashed out at the motor with her fist, missed, spun around and fell into Jimrsquos arms.Saul Church was only a mile away. The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man. The bride jumped to her feet. Well done.rsquo She kissed him on the nose. lsquoItrsquos a lovely ring,rsquo said an embarrassed Jim. lsquoI am engaged, havenrsquot got the ring yet.rsquoThe bride grabbed the ring and placed it on to her finger lsquoThen you had best get a move on, you donrsquot want to lose her.rsquo She took out a hanky and blew her nose with considerable force.Jim noticed in the torch light that she was muddy and dishevelled, her face and red hair littered with spots of mud.lsquoYou donrsquot have a driver rsquo he asked. lsquoSmelly little man, didnrsquot trust him, kicked him out a mile or so back,rsquo she replied. Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring. Where did you get yours rsquo Jim inquired.                                                                    lsquoYou like it rsquo asked his odd passenger as she struggled in vain to apply lipstick. Jim smiled and nodded his head. The bride inspected her ring lsquoItrsquos very nice, expensive,rsquo she boasted. lsquoWas it handed down through your fianceacutersquos family rsquo The bride didnrsquot reply. lsquoI live in London, I am visiting my uncle Will, do you know him, Will OrsquoBrien rsquoJim noticed that the young lady was gazing out of the window, looking slightly lost, she was not in the mood for conversation. The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago. Her husband called around almost at once to see me, gave me this for you. How he knew yoursquod be here is beyond a mystery.rsquoUncle Will handed Jim a small box. He opened it. To his surprise it was a engagement ring, silver with a small amber jewel at its centre. Jim focused his eyes and read the inscription lsquoTo M.K, Saul .rsquo Uncle Will popped a bun into his mouth. lsquoYour young ladyrsquos called Mary Kane rsquo lsquoMaureenrsquos maiden name was Keenan, She married her husband back in, let me think...rsquo Jim closed the little box. lsquoAt Saul Church, Christmas ,rsquo he replied.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever. But I always say to that isI woke up tomorrow morning to see my partner battered or bruised and he told me I had done it last night with drink in me, would I take a drink again  Yet these guys continue to do it.ldquoThere is no doubt about that we work with traumatised women and children and people try and deal with it in many dferent ways. Trauma basically makes the whole world unsafe for you and you donrsquot know where the next incident will come from.Support and information are available at www.womensaidni.org including information on the local centres covering all of Northern IrelandTo contact police, call the non-emergency lsquorsquo number or call lsquorsquo in an emergency.

Given that puppies cannot get these vaccinations until they are  weeks old and then can’t travel until  days after that, it means they can’t be transferred to Northern Ireland until they are at least  weeks old.This puts the volunteer puppy raisers for Guide Dogs in an impossible position because these puppies are normally placed in homes from eight weeks old. As a matter of urgency Minister Poots and Minister Eustice should work together to put an exemption in place for assistance dogs.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help. Hersquos been a fantastic mentor to many and for that we thank him. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community\"The increasing numbers of Covid- case numbers across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan Health Board area could not be any more serious or alarming.Therefore, this message needs to be acted upon urgently and be seen as a warning to each and every one of us about the seriousness of the health situation we are all now facing.If current projections continue, then by Christmas week we will be seeing more than four times the number of new infections each day, than we were seeing at the start of December. These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious.

People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi.

Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit.

Not just from the virus but the isolation our response to it creates.So the Penarth Times will publish, online and in print, a list of support services - public organisations, charities, community groups and local volunteers - who are there to help in whatever way through this dficult time.And we are asking you to play your part by doing three things.First,you know an organisation or group that should be on our list, let us know and well add them so more people can benefit.If you know of a group doing good in your community, tell us so we can share their story and provide hope and inspiration.And, most importantly, think about who the people are in your community who you might be able to help, be it a card through the door or dropping off some shopping. In short, look out for each other.More NewsSecond coronavirus vaccine approved for use in the UKPenarth nativity delights audiences despite lockdown challengesFigures on police use of force and tasers on childrenThe campaign has been welcomed by Vale of Glamorgan Senedd member Jane Hutt said: \"The Penarth Times has continued to serve our community throughout the pandemic and I am pleased to support its Were in it Together campaign.\"Teams of volunteers, including family, friends and neighbours, have directly supported vulnerable members of our local community and I am pleased that the Penarth Times is highlighting these efforts and sharing offers of support.\"You can take share your suggestions or stories by emailing us at penarthtimes@penarthtimes or calling  .You can share ideas on social media too using #InItTogether. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt is expected that at least , doses will be available within the first two weeks of the rollout.Last week, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencyauthorised the AstraZeneca vaccine as safe and effective following stringent clinical trials - just three weeks after the first coronavirus vaccine, Pfizer BioNTech, was approved for use across the UK.The Welsh Government and NHS Wales have been preparing for the vaccinationsrsquo approvals and delivery since June.Around  million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been procured for use in the UK.Two doses will be needed, with an interval of between four and  weeks between doses.This is a change from previous advice for both vaccines of a four week gap between doses, as the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas recommended that as many people as possible in the top priority groups should sequentially be offered a first vaccine dose as the initial priority.Based on a UK-wide priority system, the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine has already begun to be administered to frontline health and social care staff, as well as care home residents and staff and people aged over  and the AstraZeneca vaccine will enable more.Latest figures to end of Sat th December show that more than , people have so far received the first dose of the vaccine.Every health board in Wales will receive their allocation in proportion to the size of its priority population and ability to deliver, as outlined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationrsquos prioritisation list.Unlike the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures.This means it will have few storage and transportation issues, making it much easier to use in community settings such as care homes and primary care settings like GP surgeries.People are asked not to phone their GP, pharmacy or hospital asking when they will get a vaccine.When someone is in one of the groups eligible for the vaccine, they will be invited to attend a dedicated clinic which will have been set up to ensure patient safety and that of the healthcare professionals.Correspondence will come from local health boards and the vaccine is free of charge through the NHS.People are warned to be alert to scams asking for money or personal information.Health minister, Vaughan Gething said: ldquoToday marks a key milestone in our fight against the COVID- pandemic.\"The roll-out of the AstraZeneca vaccine has been called a lsquogame changerrsquo and this is true - its potential should not be underestimated.ldquoIn less than a month Walesrsquo NHS has mobilised the largest vaccination programme our country has ever seen and so far more than , people have received their first dose.ldquoNow, only  days since regulatory approval of the new vaccine for use in the UK, a second vaccine is here and ready for use, signicantly adding to Walesrsquo defences in the face of coronavirus and protecting our most vulnerable.Senior responsible officer for Walesrsquo COVID- vaccine programme, Dr Gillian Richardson added:ldquoIt is fantastic news that there is now a second vaccine to help protect our communitiesrsquo most vulnerable from the harms of COVID-.ldquoPace will be governed by supply, which will start slowly this week but build vastly over the coming weeks and months.\"However, vaccinations are happening in GP surgeries from today and we will also see an increase in our vaccination centres over the course of this month.ldquoIt is so important that people continue to wait their turn for the vaccine ndash you will be contacted when your time comes.\"Please do not contact your GP or local pharmacy and add unnecessary pressures to their workload. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityDistrict Judge Vanessa Baraitser said at the Old Bailey on Monday that, due to the real risk of suicide, the -year-old should not be extradited by ldquoreason of mental health.Assange wiped his brow after the decision was announced while his fiancee, Stella Moris, with whom he has two young sons, wept, before she was embraced by WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson.The US government has given notice it will appeal the decision and has two weeks to lodge grounds, while Assange has been remanded in custody ahead of a bail application.He is wanted to face an -count indictment, alleging a plot to hack computers and a conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information.The case followed WikiLeaksrsquo publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents in  and  relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, as well as diplomatic cables.Prosecutors say Assange helped US defence analyst Cha Manning breach the Espionage Act in unlawfully obtaining material, was complicit in hacking by others, and published classied information that put the lives of US informants in danger. Assange denies plotting with Manning to crack an encrypted password on US Department of Defence computers and says there is no evidence that anyonersquos safety was put at risk. vw,vw,px, px\"Julian Assangersquos partner, Stella Moris His lawyers had said he faced up to  years in jailconvicted, although the US government said the sentence was more likely to be between four and six years.Assange has been held in high security Belmarsh prison since he was carried out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London by police before being arrested for breaching his bail conditions in April .The defence legal team argued that the US prosecution is political and said Assange, who has been diagnosed with Aspergerrsquos syndrome and severe depression, is a high suicide riskhe is extradited.Assange, who sat in the dock of Court  in a blue suit and wearing a green face mask below his nose, closed his eyes repeatedly as the judge read out her ruling, rejecting a string of defence arguments, including freedom of speech and that the prosecution was politically motivated.She said: ldquoIf the allegations are proved then the agreement with Ms Manning and other groups of computer hackers took him outside any role of investigative journalism.ldquoHe was acting to further the overall objective of WikiLeaks to obtain protected information by hacking,necessary. vw,vw,px, px\"Supporters of Assange celebrate outside the Old Bailey The judge said Assangersquos dealings with Ms Manning ldquowent beyond the mere encouragement of a journalist and that he was ldquowell aware of the danger to informants by disclosing unredacted names in leaked documents.But turning to his mental health she said: ldquoNotwithstanding the strong and constant support he received from his family and friends Mr Assange has remained either severely or moderately clinically depressed throughout his detention at HMP Belmarsh.She said there was a real risk he would be submitted to Special Administrative Measures and detained at the ADX Florence Supermax jailextradited.ldquoIrsquom satisfied that Mr Assange has the intellect and determination to circumvent suicide prevention measures, the judge said in her ruling.ldquoFaced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at HMP Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr Assange from finding a way to commit suicide and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental health and I order his discharge.Later, Assangersquos lawyer Ed Fitzgerald QC asked to put off a bail application until Wednesday.He said he wished to set out the current situation in Belmarsh jail where Assange has been held and stringent bail conditions which Assange could be subjected to to reassure the prosecution he would not abscond.Judge Baraitser agreed to a further hearing at Westminster magistratesrsquo court..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Julian Assange avoids extradition to United States article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
