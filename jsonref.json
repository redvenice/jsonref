It showed him queueing to pay for fuel and, as he did so, suddenly putting his hand on the shoulder of the woman in front of him for no apparent reason.He then walked forward to the alleged victim\u0027s till and could be seen almost immediately reaching out to the woman\u0027s chest area with his left hand. It was clear in the video that her own hands did not leave the counter.Mr Gough claimed she had moved her polo shirt aside herself so he could read the rest of her tattoo - but the CCTV clearly showed that did not happen and he said he could not understand why not. During yesterday\u0027s trial the court heard that the woman cashier in a Gloucester shoppetrol station had a two line sentence about love tattooed just above her right breast. She said it was positioned so it would be covered up by her work polo shirt and she would look \u0027professional.\u0027When Mr Gough approached her, she said: \u0027Hhis fingers went on my top and pulled it down and to the right.\u0027He pulled it across to reveal the full length of my tattoo. His fingers were on the skin of my chest.\u0027She said she asked if he was trying to read the tattoo but he just grinned and did not really respond and he did not question her about it.\u0027When he pulled my top across he leaned his head down and started looking at it,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was quite shocked. I didn\u0027t know what to do. I just wanted to serve him and get him out of the shop.\u0027She estimated his hand was on her for about five seconds.\u0027It was part of my breast - the top part of my breast, a personal place,\u0027 she said. \u0027When he did go my stomach turned. It made me shake. I felt really uncomfortable, I felt like crying. But I didn\u0027t want to make a scene in front of the customers.          After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault\u0027I turned to my colleague and said \u0027He just pulled my top across. Do you mind if I go?\u0027\u0027I felt overwhelmed and emotional. I contacted my mum and I burst into tears. I spoke to my manager and we decided to call the police.\u0027Cross-examined by Tim Burrows, for Mr Gough, she denied that he had asked her about whether the letters \u0027red\u0027 in the tattoo related to Manchester United or Ferrari. He said nothing of the kind, she insisted.Linda Mustoe, the woman in the queue in front of Mr Gough before the incident, told the court he stood quite close behind her and made her feel \u0027uncomfortable.\u0027\u0027Then I felt something touch me. It was a hand on my left shoulder,\u0027 she said. \u0027I quickly looked around and saw the man. He said sorry and moved back. \u0027She said while she was being served Mr Gough went to the next till and after he left she heard the cashier saying \u0027That man has just pulled my top down.\u0027\u0027She was distressed and I said, Actually, he made me feel uncomfortable too. He actually touched me.\u0027In evidence, Mr Gough said the woman\u0027s tattoo was up on her collarbone, not her breast, and he could only see the letters \u0027red\u0027 so he asked \u0027Are you Man U then, or Ferrari?\u0027\u0027She said \u0027Do you want to see it?\u0027 and I said \u0027I don\u0027t mind.\u0027 She pulled it to the side and she laughed.\u0027When I put my hand out I may have flicked her top, I don\u0027t know.\u0027After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault.\u0027She said he took hold of her polo shirt and pulled it across to reveal her skin - the CCTV revealed he did,\u0027 said court chairman Andrew Tabor. \u0027He denied touching her at all although grudgingly admitted he might have flicked her clothing. He claimed she opened her shirt to show the tattoo even though CCTV evidence showed her hands not to leave her till.\u0027We are satisfied he did indeed touch her to reveal her tattoo. That action could be perceived to be sexual but we are not convinced that the purpose was sexual.\u0027When the court declared Mr Gough not guilty of sexual assault he raised both hands above his head and said \u0027Correct decision, Sir.\u0027He insisted he had absolutely no sexual motive for what he did.\u0027I have taught 3,000 girls between the ages of 17 and 25 to drive - a total of 90,000 hours in the car on my own with them no problem, and now I get some cock and bull story. I\u0027m sorry, no way,\u0027 he said. Mr Gough appeared on Britain\u0027s Got Talent in May last year and set a world record by reciting the alphabet backwards in four seconds. He also tried to set a new record for telling the most jokes in one minute but dried up and fell well short of his 27 joke target.In 1999 the lifelong driving instructor set a world record after averaging 113 miles per gallon when he drove his car from Exeter to Gloucester. He used only one gallon of unleaded petrol in his 850cc Perodua Nippa car up the M5 but to achieve the record had to go at only 35mph.Then in 2003 Mr Gough set another record by driving a Toyota Yaris 28 miles on just one litre of fuel."},{"url":null,"title":"National Lottery results Lotto draw Wednesday 4th July","story":"The Bachelorette finale: All you need to know about the season 14 finalePamplona bull run 2018: All you need to know about San Fermin\u0027s Running of the Bulls festivalITV to launch Absolutely Ascot in bid to rival Made in ChelseaThe rules Meghan Markle has to follow but Princess Eugenie and Beatrice don\u0027t revealedLondon Pride 2018: Starbucks to celebrate with Glitter FrappuccinosPaul McCartney tour: Freshen Up UK tour dates, tickets and venuesTour de France 2018: All you need to know about the 105th editionNational Lottery results: Lotto draw for Wednesday, 4th JulyWorld Cup 2018: Bank of Russia jokes it predicted Russia\u0026#8217s victory over Spain on special currencyCalum Best calls for Love Island bosses to have more focus on mental health supportEngland vs Sweden football history revealed ahead of 2018 World Cup fixture on SaturdayPrince Louis christening: Who will Kate Middleton and Prince William invite?EuroMillions results: National lottery winning numbers for Tuesday, 3rd July 2018 drawWhen Kate Middleton will next wear a tiara revealedIndependence Day: How to keep your dog calm during July 4th fireworksBachelorette\u0027s Chris Randone shares photo of himself at age 13 when he was 230lbs... after another contestant said he used to be a \u0027fat f***\u0027Who is Kyle Edmund?

The Beckham franchise, when it gets going, will also bring a training center and an academy focused on developing local players to the Miami area.The stadium-location quest is just the latest drawn-out chapter in Beckham\u0027s five-years-and-counting marathon to bring MLS back to Miami. The Miami Fusion played from 1998-2001, folding because of poor attendance.Beckham and MLS announced in January that the franchise would be coming to Miami, but nearly every detail about the club remains unclear. There\u0027s no definitive start date - 2020 has been mentioned repeatedly, even though no new stadium could possibly be ready by then - as well as no team name, no logo, no colors, no coaching staff and no front-office personnel.More than a year ago, Miami-Dade County commissioners approved a deal to sell Beckham nearly three acres of county land for $9 million with the belief that it would be the last parcel he needed for a stadium site in the city\u0027s Overtown neighborhood. But that site was never the preferred choice for Beckham and his group anyway, with the original hope being to build on the waterfront near the Port of Miami.The Overtown site now seems all but doomed, though it\u0027s unclear what would happen if city commissioners or voters block the latest Beckham plan.          Beckham preferred a site near the Port of Miami, but traffic from the port\u0027s bridge and from American Airlines Arena - the home of the Miami Heat - made the intersection unusable    In this January 29, 2018, file photo, David Beckham speaks at an event where it was announced that Major League Soccer is bringing an expansion team to Miami.

If they can\u0027t afford to, though, or they drive a company car, then it starts to become a problem for them.\u0027I think a lot of men feel emasculated by a woman in a powerful position, whether that\u0027s in the boardroom or behind the wheel of a car.\u0027I don\u0027t rise to the comments I get when I\u0027m out driving. I generally reply with a witty putdown to make it clear I\u0027m not just a WAG in a shiny car with no clue how to drive it.\u0027          Company boss Maya Hartge is used to attracting attention when she\u0027s driving her Porsche 981 Spyder convertibleWhile the idea that a man might find it hard to cope with a woman driving a fancy car may sound dated, according to John Groeger, Professor of Psychology at Nottingham Trent University, who has a particular interest in motoring, what Maya experiences is a common reaction.Even in 2018, some men find it hard to cope with the idea that many women are now big earners — and savers — and can splash out on whatever car takes their fancy.\u0027One of the things we\u0027ve noticed in our research is that people will get angry and behave aggressively towards drivers they believe are of a lower status than themselves,\u0027 says Professor Groeger.\u0027Sexism is still rife in all areas of life — and there\u0027s plenty of it lurking in the traffic system, too. We know from experimental studies that others make assumptions about our wealth, status, personality or competence based on the vehicle we drive.\u0027We carried out one experiment using two identical white vans, one of them bearing the livery of an emergency services vehicle. Other drivers drove with far more care and respect around the latter than when it was an unmarked white van.\u0027We also compared reactions to vehicles with and without L-plates. We are quicker to blame, and act aggressively, towards people we feel are lower status — those whose cars carry L-plates, for example. We forgive them less easily, yet are quite prepared to exonerate people we feel are more like ourselves.\u0027So we have a clash between the apparent status of the vehicle and the assumed characteristics of the people who drive them.\u0027According to statistics released in April this year by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), female car ownership is at a record high, and more women than ever are buying into the luxury car market.In recent years, Porsche alone has doubled its sales of vehicles to women. Meanwhile, convertibles are now most likely to be bought by women in their 50s, with sales to this demographic quadrupling in just 15 years.          Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis (pictured)frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.Maya bought her Porsche two years ago as a limited edition, meaning it\u0027s a collectors\u0027 item unlikely to depreciate in value.Her first car was rather different, though.\u0027It was a Fiat Punto HLX 16 valve which cost just over £13,000 when I was 18,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I worked like a dog, six days a week for a year, in my IT technical support job to save up for it. My friends were out spending their money on having fun and holidaying in Ibiza, but my heart was set on that car.\u0027By the time she was 24 she had her own successful business and had saved enough money to splash out on her first \u0027supercar\u0027 — an Aston Martin DBS coupé that cost around £180,000 and which she still owns.\u0027I buy high performance cars because I love driving them, especially on tracks in the UK and abroad,\u0027 says Maya, who says she inherited her love of fast cars from her father, a former racing driver. She puts her collection of cars to good use by charging for rides in them at events in aid of The Children\u0027s Trust.\u0027I do think it\u0027s a shame that men tar all women with the old stereotype of us not being able to drive or park. When I take my cars on track days, I can see that men there think they\u0027re going to be better drivers than me. I just keep quiet and let my driving prove how wrong they are.\u0027While Maya aims to respond to putdowns with wit and charm, men who take on events director Henrietta Sauleek are less amused when she\u0027s at the wheel of her bright blue £70,000 Audi RS4, which can go from 0-60mph in 4.1 seconds.\u0027On one occasion, in a car park, a man aged about 60 drove slowly past me as I got out of my car. He wound down the window on his family saloon and said to me: \u0027That car is not for a woman.\u0027 What I was thinking is unprintable, but I didn\u0027t give him the satisfaction of a reply.\u0027I\u0027ve had men of all ages cut me up, or they try to stop me joining a lane of traffic if two lanes merge into one. A lot of them are tradesmen in their 30s, driving vans. I doubt they\u0027d do it to my husband if he was driving my car.\u0027Henrietta, 33, who lives in Basingstoke with her husband, a company director and their children, aged four and one, adds: \u0027I\u0027ve had a passion for cars since passing my test at the age of 19, but I\u0027ve never had hassle from men until I got the RS4 a year ago.\u0027I started to think that perhaps it was all in my own head, until last month when the car went into the garage for general maintenance.\u0027She was given a standard Audi A5 saloon as a courtesy car for a couple of weeks while the work was being done.\u0027Suddenly, I was anonymous and invisible on the roads again and didn\u0027t get any aggravation from other drivers,\u0027 she says. \u0027It cemented the fact that I really had been getting derogatory comments from men because I was driving a sports car. I can only assume it\u0027s because they are jealous.\u0027Since getting her RS4 back three weeks ago, she\u0027s again having to put up with sexist assumptions.\u0027We were out as a family a few days ago and were just getting out of the car when a guy walking past said to my husband: \u0027Nice car, mate!\u0027 assuming that it must be his,\u0027 says Henrietta. In fact, her husband drives a rather less flashy VW Golf, albeit top of the range, and says he never gets any trouble at the wheel of either car.It was after spotting a woman at the wheel of a \u0027stunning Porsche\u0027 in a traffic jam 12 years ago that Henrietta vowed to save hard to one day own a sports car herself.\u0027I chose the RS4 purely for me — not to show off but because it\u0027s a stunning car,\u0027 she says. \u0027I\u0027ve worked really hard, we don\u0027t spend much on our social life, and I really appreciate cars.\u0027It\u0027s a fun and empowering car. I love the adrenaline rush I get when I accelerate and the engine roars, but clearly it aggravates certain men. I\u0027ve never experienced any animosity from other women.\u0027 Professor Groeger explains that this sort of reaction is indicative of the human tendency endlessly to compare ourselves to others. It also reveals that many men still see themselves as higher up the social pecking order than women.\u0027Sometimes, when we come off badly, we\u0027re not that upset by it, for example if the other person is a talented sports person driving a great car,\u0027 he says. \u0027But in other cases we feel resentful if we assume that a person has had success in a way that we haven\u0027t, or that we feel is underserved.\u0027So, if a man is well educated, has worked hard and done quite well for himself but sees a woman driving a car he could only dream of being able to afford, he might feel irritated by that, though it\u0027s obviously sexist.\u0027 Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.\u0027Men sit at traffic lights and look at me while revving their engines in anticipation of the lights changing to green, but I tend to be a bit naughty and deliberately leave them standing,\u0027 says Ingrid, who\u0027s now retired from the company she owned and lives with her partner Richard, 62, in Hertfordshire.\u0027They can\u0027t resist overtaking me. If I\u0027m doing 80mph, they want to do 90mph. They glare at me and I can see they\u0027re thinking: \u0027How dare you be in a car like that?\u0027A youthful 70, Ingrid bought her five-year-old Boxter earlier this year (they cost over £40,000 new). Unlike Maya and Henrietta, she says she also encounters aggression from women drivers — and it annoys her because she feels it\u0027s \u0027not sisterly\u0027.\u0027Last week, I was on the motorway in a variable speed area and there was a woman right behind me trying to edge me out of the way so she could get past. Others try to cut me up.\u0027Ingrid\u0027s love affair with sporty cars began when she was 20 and her father bought her a coveted Austin-Healey Sprite.With the roof down on her Boxter, she often attracts admiring glances from men. \u0027Men seem to think me driving a car like this gives them a licence to flirt with me, and even young guys smile at me,\u0027 she says. \u0027I guess those sort of glances are flattering.\u0027And I do see why some men feel they have to compete with me when they see me in the Porsche. I think it stems from cars having been a traditionally macho item.\u0027But they\u0027re just going to have to get used to more women, in better cars, overtaking them in the fast lane.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/01/4DF704B200000578-5923739-The_19_year_old_was_crowned_with_the_title_a_year_after_she_inke-m-28_1530838484459.jpg","title":"KFC free chicken winner tattoo fried chicken got Schoolies Gold Coast","story":"    Brooke Collins (pictured) won the \u0027Chicken Cheque\u0027 after the fast food outlet conducted a national search for the best \u0027hilarious story\u0027 about the greasy delicacy          The 19-year-old was crowned with the title a year after she inked her ankle (pictured) with the global icon \u0027KFC\u0027 during a Schoolies trip to the Gold Coast\u0027If that doesn\u0027t show dedication and love for KFC then I dunno what does,\u0027 Brooke wrote alongside her Facebook entry.The Sydney girl said she and her friend \u0027bonded\u0027 over fried chicken during the Year 12 and \u0027wanted to get matching tattoos at schoolies\u0027.\u0027So we got to the Gold Coast and had time to kill before check-in, and basically went and got the tattoos after being at Schoolies for not even half an hour!

Lest we forget: Jewish diarist Anne Frank, pictured in 1940, went into hiding with her family in Amsterdam in 1942, and died in a German Nazi concentration camp three years later, after they were discovered and deportedHowever, he also mentioned that \u0027all the papers have been destroyed there\u0027, because on May 14, 1940, while the Frank family was still on a waiting list for possible visas, the American consulate was devastated during German bombardment and all papers were lost.Even without the loss of their visa application, it would have been difficult for the Franks to immigrate to the United States.With hundreds of thousands of people seeking refuge in the US each year by the time war broke out in 1939, Washington was issuing fewer than 30,000 annual visas.The processing of a visa application also lasted several years and included a huge amount of paper work, and affidavits from relatives or friends in the US.Even with all these demands fulfilled, applicants could still be turned down.The new research focused on the paper trail, looking at documents such as the affidavits of support, testimonies on character and other such items provided to the US authorities in the screening process, in addition to items such as birth certificates, wedding certificates, tax clearances and more.The war further complicated any immigration efforts.          Efforts: Otto Frank, pictured with Anne in 1941, is thought to have tried twice to apply for U.S. visas and once to Cuba but was \u0027thwarted by American bureaucracy, war and time\u0027A renewed attempt in 1941 to get the family to the US failed because all American consulates in Germany-occupied Europe, including the Netherlands, were closed by the Nazis.A visa application to Cuba that same year also never came through.While the Franks were not explicitly denied visas by the American consulate, \u0027their efforts were thwarted by American bureaucracy, war and time\u0027, the historians wrote.\u0027All their attempts failed, so going into hiding was their last attempt trying to get out of the hands of the Nazis,\u0027 said Annemarie Bekker, from the Anne Frank House.The family hid for more than two years during the war and it was then that Anne wrote her famous diary.On August 4, 1944, they were discovered and ultimately deported to Auschwitz. Only Anne\u0027s father survived the war. Anne, who was 15, and her sister died in the Bergen-Belsen camp.After the war, Mr Frank had his daughter\u0027s diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into dozens of languages.The house where the Franks hid was turned into a museum that is one of Amsterdam\u0027s most popular tourist attractions."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/09/4DF842D100000578-0-image-a-3_1530867475018.jpg","title":"Grandfather 81 performs BACKFLIP pool two years going viral trick","story":"    Getting ready!

People of Russia began to eat and sell human limbs due to the food struggle during the Russian famine of 1921          This photo taken in October 1921 shows starving children at Samara Camp during the famine in RussiaRussian academics have previously researched and catalogued examples of cannibalism and corpse eating and in one account described how a woman refused to give over her husband\u0027s dead body because she was using it for meat.The starving peasants were even seen digging up recently buried corpses to retrieve their flesh, as well as eating grass and animals that were previously considered pets. The police took no action as cannabalism was considered a legitimate method of survival.Eventually aid workers from America and Europe arrived and in 1921 one wrote a stomach churning account of what they\u0027d seen: \u0027Families were killing and devouring fathers, grandfathers and children.\u0027Ghastly rumours about sausages prepared with human corpses though officially contradicted, were common. In the market, among rough huckstresses swearing at each other, one heard threats to make sausages of a person.\u0027Annother aid worker reported : \u0027Families were killing and devouring fathers, grandfathers and children.\u0027Under the headline \u0027Mother turns cannibal\u0027, the Mirror reported on January 16,1922: \u0027Famine is so acute in the Pugatjewsk district of Samara that a woman at the village of Mokscha was found eating the corpse of her daughter.\u0027          A couple with their starving children during a famine in the U.S.S.R., circa 1922          This photo taken in 1921 shows a family stricken by famine in the Volga region, Russia, during the Russian Civil War          In this picture taken in October 1921, famine-stricken refugee children are seen in Russia during the Russian Civil WarOther disturbing images from the famine show children suffering with severe malnutrition, their stomachs bloated and almost every bone in their body visible.One of the worst hit places was the city of Samara, situated in the southeastern part of European Russia at the confluence of the Volga and Samara Rivers.Aid from outside Russia was initially rejected by Lenin because he saw it as other countries interfering. Polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen came to the city in 1921 and was horrified by what he saw - almost the entire city was dying from hunger.He raised 40 billion Swiss francs and established up to 900 places where people could get food.Lenin was eventually convinced to let international aid agencies in and Nansen was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.The American American Relief Administration, who were told they could not help in 1919, were granted access to the sick and starving in 1921 and provided great relief along with European aid agencies such as Save The Children.Lenin died shortly after the famine, in 1924, and was replaced by Joseph Stalin who became the  leader of the Soviet Union.Uncle of Alesha MacPhail posts video of them playing togetherSun seekers hit the beach in Scarborough as heatwave continuesMPs arrive at Chequers for day of discussion around Brexit blueprintPolice on the Isle of Bute confirm Alesha MacPhail was murderedCouple say they\u0027ve decided to show the World Cup at their weddingShocking moment man films himself being SHOT in the face during argumentRescue mission: Footage emerges from depths of flooded Thai caveLove Island: Alex munches on biscuit as Wes chats with MeganMusician Elvis Costello plays Global Citizen Festival in 2013Thai er who died shares video before travelling to caveTerrifying moment newlyweds e for cover as branch fallsSunshine set to continue to bathe Britain    A canteen for starving people in the town of Pokrovsk, near Saratov, in the Soviet union, in 1923  A starving child is pictured by a door frame (left) and another (right) is seen looking weak and frail in famined Russia          A child is pictured crying in a hospital of  Samara.

So it is one-zero for us then.\u0027We do have caviar, but I am pretty sure they can manage without caviar and it will be a good game. Otherwise they are welcome to visit us. It will be a fantastic match between two great teams.\u0027He added: \u0027We had Netherlands and France in our (qualifying) group and we beat Italy in a play off.

But we go in to the quarter final in a very good mood.\u0027  The Swedish delegation have been privately meeting human and civil rights leaders in Russia and supporting their work. Mr Sjostrand added: \u0027 England have so many good players and they should beat us. But it would be so boring if life was always like that.\u0027He said the Swedish fans would support England if Sweden is knocked out and added: \u0027Harry Kane is a fantastic player and we follow the Premier League in Sweden.    Despite Sweden claiming victory in the battle of the hotels, Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be hoping for a repeat of their heroics when they beat Colombia on Tuesday (pictured)\u0027I am a Manchester United supporter and one of my daughters is called Ester because of Manchester.\u0027 I also follow Ashley Young , Rashford and Lingard. England have so many good players.He said he expected between 1000 and1500 fans to be in the Samara Arena on Saturday evening to be supporting Sweden.He added \u0027To come here is a challenge because of a lack of flights and it is really expensive.\u0027We had 500-6000 people at our last match because it was in St Petersburg and it not so difficult to travel from Sweden. People came by car and by train through Finland.\u0027We hope for a great match and of course a Swedish victory. But overall, a fair match which will be great for the supporters and enjoyed by the world.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/10/4DF8318B00000578-5924913-image-a-22_1530869652502.jpg","title":"How Jesse Lingard Englands King Social Media","story":"    This tweet by Jesse Lingard this week assured his place as the king of social media in the England team, whose image has been transformed by players\u0027 use of Instagram and Twitter          He is now turning his footballing and online prowess into a strong brand, based on his distinctive goal celebration, in which he spells out his initials with his hands          He is now busy building a brand around his celebration and his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027The public\u0027s love of the England team is a million miles from when Sam Allardyce lost his job as England manager  after he was filmed talking to undercover reporters posing as businessmen.Back then, confidence in the national team was at rock bottom.  But now, just two years on, England have rebuilt their public image, thanks to squeaky-clean Gareth Southgate and his squad of fresh-faced young players.Among them is 25-year-old Lingard, who, with four million Instagram followers, is at the head of a group of stars whose social media posts are watched by thousands of young fans.EXCLUSIVE: Sweden\u0027s WAGS will stay at the same hotel as the...EXCLUSIVE: Man dumped by Gareth Southgate\u0027s wife for England...Share this articleA social media hit this week came Jesse filmed fellow young player Trent Alexander-Arnold saying \u0027It\u0027s coming home\u0027 to him on the pitch after the Colombia victory.Lingard has also posted videos of himself dancing in his pants with Ruben Loftus-Cheek in the changing room, being shaved by teammates and celebrating with fans.Such videos give fans a players\u0027 eye view of the World Cup and take supporters inside the England camp in a way never seen before.     He is currently believed to be single after his relationship with Jena Frumes ended in scandal          Jena split from Jesse before tweeting: \u0027At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride\u0027          Lingard and Ms Frumes split up in March after she posed for steamy pictures in his shirtSocial media experts say his and other players\u0027 tweets and videos are building a new image for the national side, totally distinct from the days of \u0027dentist chair\u0027 drinkathons and Graham Taylor\u0027s \u0027turnips\u0027.Former Twitter head of sport Lewis Wiltshire told The Daily Star: \u0027If there is a player who uses Instagram better or more effectively than Jesse Lingard, I\u0027m yet to see them.\u0027These players are from a generation where they understand and enjoy this stuff.\u0027I\u0027m convinced it\u0027s at the heart of why this England team\u0027s public image is different from, say, 10 years ago.\u0027Mr Wiltshire says he doesn\u0027t believe a representative handles Jesse\u0027s social media for him, as with other players, which may be part of its success.The Manchester United midfielder could now use his performances in the World Cup to launch a strong Beckham-like \u0027brand\u0027.He has used Instagram to give fans a players-eye view of the World Cup, including video of him dancing in his pants in the changing room  He stays close to his grandmother and grandfather, who helped get him into football as a childThree weeks before the tournament, Lingard applied for four trademarks, three centred on his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027 and another featuring his goal celebration, in which he holds his hands in front of his face and spells out his initials.He has since launched a clothing range, including caps, T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with his goal celebration logo, which have already all sold out on his website jlingz.com.Andy Sutherden, head of sport  marketing at H+K Strategies, told CityAM: \u0027Jesse Lingard\u0027s team has acknowledged the fact that if he does well in Russia, there’s an immediate opportunity but one with a very short shelf life. \u0027They’re also understanding of the fact that people who become known for something different - think Crouch and the robot - extend their marketing appeal beyond the audience of sport.\u0027 Meanwhile, there are rumours that Manchester United bosses are set to increase his wages from £75,000 to £150,000 to keep other clubs from trying to tempt him away.          The 25-year-old midfielder is one of a new generation of players who is savvy with social media          While communicating with his millions of Instagram followers, he has created a strong brand          He has now used the platform to launch a range of clothing, including these JLingz capsOne thing that makes his social media postings different from some of teammates is the lack of a girlfriend.He dated childhood sweetheart Emma Hyde for five years until he ended it in 2016.He later went out with glamorous US-based Instagram model Jena Frumes, but she dumped him after a tabloid newspaper revealed he had sex with an admin assistant from Sheffield in a hot tub.Jesse remains committed to his family, and even has a picture of his mother Kirsty, 49, in his room in Russia.As a boy he attended Beamont Community Primary school in Warrington, where most of the boys his age wanted to play rugby league.His grandfather Ken, a former GB power lifter, was the one who suggested he take up football and ferried him to training sessions and matches.

People of Russia began to eat and sell human limbs due to the food struggle during the Russian famine of 1921          This photo taken in October 1921 shows starving children at Samara Camp during the famine in RussiaRussian academics have previously researched and catalogued examples of cannibalism and corpse eating and in one account described how a woman refused to give over her husband\u0027s dead body because she was using it for meat.The starving peasants were even seen digging up recently buried corpses to retrieve their flesh, as well as eating grass and animals that were previously considered pets. The police took no action as cannabalism was considered a legitimate method of survival.Eventually aid workers from America and Europe arrived and in 1921 one wrote a stomach churning account of what they\u0027d seen: \u0027Families were killing and devouring fathers, grandfathers and children.\u0027Ghastly rumours about sausages prepared with human corpses though officially contradicted, were common. In the market, among rough huckstresses swearing at each other, one heard threats to make sausages of a person.\u0027Annother aid worker reported : \u0027Families were killing and devouring fathers, grandfathers and children.\u0027Under the headline \u0027Mother turns cannibal\u0027, the Mirror reported on January 16,1922: \u0027Famine is so acute in the Pugatjewsk district of Samara that a woman at the village of Mokscha was found eating the corpse of her daughter.\u0027          A couple with their starving children during a famine in the U.S.S.R., circa 1922          This photo taken in 1921 shows a family stricken by famine in the Volga region, Russia, during the Russian Civil War          In this picture taken in October 1921, famine-stricken refugee children are seen in Russia during the Russian Civil WarOther disturbing images from the famine show children suffering with severe malnutrition, their stomachs bloated and almost every bone in their body visible.One of the worst hit places was the city of Samara, situated in the southeastern part of European Russia at the confluence of the Volga and Samara Rivers.Aid from outside Russia was initially rejected by Lenin because he saw it as other countries interfering. Polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen came to the city in 1921 and was horrified by what he saw - almost the entire city was dying from hunger.He raised 40 billion Swiss francs and established up to 900 places where people could get food.Lenin was eventually convinced to let international aid agencies in and Nansen was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.The American American Relief Administration, who were told they could not help in 1919, were granted access to the sick and starving in 1921 and provided great relief along with European aid agencies such as Save The Children.Lenin died shortly after the famine, in 1924, and was replaced by Joseph Stalin who became the  leader of the Soviet Union.Uncle of Alesha MacPhail posts video of them playing togetherSun seekers hit the beach in Scarborough as heatwave continuesMPs arrive at Chequers for day of discussion around Brexit blueprintPolice on the Isle of Bute confirm Alesha MacPhail was murderedCouple say they\u0027ve decided to show the World Cup at their weddingShocking moment man films himself being SHOT in the face during argumentRescue mission: Footage emerges from depths of flooded Thai caveLove Island: Alex munches on biscuit as Wes chats with MeganMusician Elvis Costello plays Global Citizen Festival in 2013Thai er who died shares video before travelling to caveTerrifying moment newlyweds e for cover as branch fallsSunshine set to continue to bathe Britain    A canteen for starving people in the town of Pokrovsk, near Saratov, in the Soviet union, in 1923  A starving child is pictured by a door frame (left) and another (right) is seen looking weak and frail in famined Russia          A child is pictured crying in a hospital of  Samara.

So it is one-zero for us then.\u0027We do have caviar, but I am pretty sure they can manage without caviar and it will be a good game. Otherwise they are welcome to visit us. It will be a fantastic match between two great teams.\u0027He added: \u0027We had Netherlands and France in our (qualifying) group and we beat Italy in a play off.

But we go in to the quarter final in a very good mood.\u0027  The Swedish delegation have been privately meeting human and civil rights leaders in Russia and supporting their work. Mr Sjostrand added: \u0027 England have so many good players and they should beat us. But it would be so boring if life was always like that.\u0027He said the Swedish fans would support England if Sweden is knocked out and added: \u0027Harry Kane is a fantastic player and we follow the Premier League in Sweden.    Despite Sweden claiming victory in the battle of the hotels, Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be hoping for a repeat of their heroics when they beat Colombia on Tuesday (pictured)\u0027I am a Manchester United supporter and one of my daughters is called Ester because of Manchester.\u0027 I also follow Ashley Young , Rashford and Lingard. England have so many good players.He said he expected between 1000 and1500 fans to be in the Samara Arena on Saturday evening to be supporting Sweden.He added \u0027To come here is a challenge because of a lack of flights and it is really expensive.\u0027We had 500-6000 people at our last match because it was in St Petersburg and it not so difficult to travel from Sweden. People came by car and by train through Finland.\u0027We hope for a great match and of course a Swedish victory.

It also puts him in the company of Hollywood power players such as Oprah, Sarah Jessica Parker and Johnny Depp, each of whom have made literary inroads of their own. In the last decade, in fact, the celebrity imprint has become something of a cottage industry, an endeavor mutually beneficial to publishing houses in pursuit of stars and their lucrative fanbases and celebrities looking for another feather in their cap.Lena Dunham’s Lenny Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House, spawned from the actor-writer’s Lenny newsletter, a weekly feminist bulletin she launched with collaborator Jenni Konner in 2015. Aiming to “to push the ball forward ... with wit and style”, the imprint launched in 2017 with Jenny Zhang’s Sour Heart, a collection of coming-of-age tales about young immigrant women in America. Lenny Books’s next release was Courage is Contagious, a series of essays by marquee authors about former first lady Michelle Obama, which was followed this summer by Caroline Kepnes’ novel Providence. As the editorial director of the recently-launched SJP for Hogarth, another imprint of Penguin Random House, Sarah Jessica Parker published Fatima Farheen Mirza’s timely novel A Place for Us, about an Indian Muslim family navigating life in California. While a follow-up has yet to be announced, Parker, the honorary chairman of the American Library Association, selected Jonathan Miles’ Anatomy of a Miracle as the organization’s Book Club pick this year.Depp’s cryptically named Infinitum Nihil – meaning “nothing is forever” – was launched in 2012 as a ision of HarperCollins. The actor, unsurprisingly, pledged to green-light “publications that might ordinarily never have breached the parapet”, but in six years the partnership has bore little fruit: projects such as a Bob Dylan biography and a Yoko Ono photo-biopic have been indefinitely delayed. But Depp did release and write the introduction for a long-lost novel by Woody Guthrie, House of Earth, which came out under Harper Perennial.As the natural extension of her uber-successful book club, Oprah Winfrey and Flatiron Books announced An Oprah Book in 2016, the media mogul’s first publishing imprint. Oprah’s memoir, originally titled The Life You Want (now maybe titled The Path Made Clear), was slated to be its flagship release but has since been in limbo. In its absence, though, An Oprah Book led with Food, Health and Happiness, the former talk show host’s first cookbook. Ironically, the collection of 115 nutritious, Oprah-approved recipes sold like hotcakes.Though it will close once it’s published all books under contract, the late Anthony Bourdain’s imprint with the publishing house Ecco, Anthony Bourdain Books, has been the most prolific of all celebrity-sanctioned imprints, with almost a dozen releases to its name since launching in 2011. Bourdain, of course, was as much a writer as he was a chef, with a refined taste in literature and an eye for stories, people and places on the margins. That’s reflected in Anthony Bourdain Books, which has published LA Son by Roy Choi, Prophets of Smoked Meat by Daniel Vaughn and Marilyn Hagerty’s Grand Forks, a “history of American dining in 128 reviews”. Before it closes, Anthony Bourdain Books has several more releases in the pipeline, including Jose Andres’ forthcoming We Fed an Island, about the renowned chef’s time in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, and Prisoner by Jason Rezaian.Also with Grand Central Publishing, Handler inked her imprint deal back in 2010, before such forays were the ambition du jour of celebrity bibliophiles. Her first release with Borderline AmazingA Chelsea Handler Book was Lies that Chelsea Handler Told Me, a collection of humiliating tales delivered, as the book jacket states, by Chelsea’s “friends, family and other victims”. The imprint seems to have been dormant since then, with no additional titles to its name, but Handler herself has penned five books with Hachette, including My Horizontal Life, a series of dispatches from the comic’s one-night stands, and the best-selling Are You There, Vodka?

Why isn’t this top of the political agenda?The long-term warming trend is driven by the release of greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide. Many alternative causes have been tested by scientists: the effects of sunspots, volcanic eruptions and other natural events. Only greenhouse gas emissions, dominated by fossil fuel use, explain the warming over the past century. This understanding isn’t just retrospective: 30 years ago this summer, climate scientist James Hansen told a US Senate committee that the climate was changing and fossil fuels were the main culprit. He made headlines worldwide with predictions that if emissions continued our planet would continue to warm, which it inexorably has.Today’s heatwave is not related, as some have suggested, to the every-few-years shift of Pacific Ocean currents that affects global weather patterns, known as El Niño. A new modest-sized El Niño is predicted for later this year but is not yet detectable. Today’s heatwave is what is expected as Earth moves to an ever warmer state. But it is worth watching the news for the coming El Niño later this year: if it turns out to be a large event, next summer could bring more extremely hot weather. And beyond that, as the climate warms, summer heatwaves will escalate in their severity.We will therefore also need to adapt. There is a lot we can do. At an inidual level, we can cool our homes by keeping the curtains and windows shut on the sunny side of our house during the day to slow the rate at which it heats up, and then open windows at night to cool it down. We also need to keep a close eye on the very young and very old because they cannot regulate their temperatures very well, and suffer most in the heat. The major 2003 European heatwave killed 70,000 mostly older people. Changes to social care, for example, to attend to the needs of people who are vulnerable to high temperatures, can help avoid such death tolls in the future.Beyond this, many aspects of society will require deep and difficult changes, including to our own mindsets. In the summers of the future, particularly in the south of England, we will regularly live in Mediterranean-type conditions. Adapting our national infrastructure, particularly around maintaining our water supplies, updating our housing stock as it is built to retain heat, and altering how we manage our land to avoid further catastrophic fires, will all be required. It is under-appreciated that climate change will transform the very fabric of the experience of living in the UK.This coming new reality is not high on the political agenda. Climate change is a greater threat to the UK than EU directives, terrorism or a foreign power invading. Yet the scope of our political discussion on future threats is limited to Brexit and spending on defence. Instead of this blinkered view where the future is the same as the past, we need to step out of the intense heat and take a cool look at what we are doing to our home planet.The development of farming and rise of civilisations occurred within a 10,000-year window of unusually stable environmental conditions. Those stable interglacial conditions are over. Human actions are driving Earth to a hot new super-interglacial state. What scientists call the Anthropocene epoch, this unstable time, is a new chapter of history. Today’s heat is a forewarning of far worse to come. To live well in this new world needs political action to catch up with this changing reality.

Perhaps none is more keenly felt than the legacy of disappointment and hope for the future. This World Cup has been no different. England beat mediocre teams to get themselves into the last eight. Expectations race ahead of the side’s visible, albeit\u0026nbspyouthful, talents. The Swedish team England face on Saturday will no doubt provide stiffer opposition. Yet something feels different. There’s an inkling this England squad has hidden depths. Unlike teams over the last 22 years, it won a big game on penalties. In a rare departure, the England manager Gareth Southgate is articulate and thoughtful – recognising sporting success could awaken something in the country. Nations tell stories of themselves to make sense of their experience. TV audiences suggest a yearning for a tale that binds us together. Support for England is about shared values.

Team up with cartoonist Dix to tell the story of a vengeful 17th-century peasant You may not think you know Dulle Griet but you probably do – she’s the breastplated peasant striding across a war-torn land towards the mouth of hell in one of the most famous paintings by the 16th-century Flemish master Bruegel the Elder. Bertolt Brecht saw her as his own Mother Courage – “the Fury defending her pathetic household goods with the sword. The world at the end of its tether.”Jim Broadbent’s version of her is rather different. “She’s a plain woman whose tragedy is to look like me,” says the actor, whose dignified recent screen roles, such as the curmudgeonly camera seller in Julian Barnes’s The Sense of an Ending or the tragic Gloucester in Richard Eyre’s King Lear, can lead one to overlook an important biographical detail: he cut his acting teeth in the 1980s as one half of a grandiosely named comedy duo, the National Theatre of Brent, hamming it up as Marie Antoinette or the Virgin Mary in uproarious re-enactments of the Bible and the French revolution.Broadbent, as his friends have told him, is a “notoriously picky” actor. Though he seems to be a constant presence on stage and screen, he quite often has time on his hands. His original idea was to make a film of Dull Margaret, with himself in the title role. He wrote the screenplay and showed it around, but when the money failed to materialise and he began to feel the zeitgeist moving against female impersonation, he decided to put her in a graphic novel instead. And who better to approach for the illustrations than the Welsh cartoonist Dix, whose Roll up! Roll Up! comic strip for the  had enlivened his day for two years in the early 00s with the antics of a ghoulish circus troupe. “I just felt we shared a sense of humour,” Broadbent says.The Dull Margaret who stars in their new book may be Griet’s darkest incarnation yet. She’s a potato-faced wraith adrift in coastal marshlands who emerges naked from the sea and is not above chopping the hand off a hanged man to enrich a putrid love potion, which she smears on her face in an attempt to witch away her loneliness.Leaping from the end of a jetty on a broomstick, she plops ignominiously into the sea, only to re-emerge two pages later in what looks like a gastroenterologist’s bad trip – a writhing tangle of orange dragon coils looming out of a palette of sombre greys and browns. And so her misfortunes continue, not least because of her own bad behaviour and her inability to choose between money and love.Is she mad? Or monstrous? No, no, no, protests Broadbent, gallantly. “I love her. I have total sympathy for her and enjoy her struggle. In a heightened way, she’s looking for what we all want: comfort, a reasonable standard of living and love. She gets robbed and abused and humiliated, and that sets her on a journey to take back control.”It turns out that this is only the fourth time author and illustrator have met. They collaborated via early-morning emails, because Dix, who lives in Hay-on-Wye and has a day job at a computer software company, does his art work between 11pm and 4am.Dix picks up the story, confessing that it took a while for him to “find” Margaret – “one was too fat, one was too neurotic and one was too vulnerable”. This was partly because he thought Broadbent was after someone who looked like one of his Roll Up! Roll Up! circus grotesques (the horizontal comic strip format rules out long, skinny people).It didn’t help, he adds, that that at first Margaret had no nose. “She was beginning to look a bit aquatic, so we thought later on we’d give her a nose – which was a nice thing to do.” Broadbent’s blue eyes widen at this revelation. “I wasn’t aware of your nose, no-nose journey,” he fires back, though he agrees it was important that she had no fat on her – “she has no carbs in her diet”.Given that Margaret is a mythical figure who rides a broomstick and stirs severed hands into potions, this sudden swerve into dietary literalism might seem surprising – but it underlines how deeply rooted the story is in the marshy coast of Lincolnshire, where Broadbent and his artist wife, Anastasia Lewis, have a cottage.It’s also deeply indebted to Bosch’s hellscapes, Goya’s witches, Daumier’s pictures of travelling acrobats and Rembrandt’s glowering Low Country landscapes – not to mention Dix’s own oddball aesthetic. “Lack of pupils in eyes is something I’m quite fond of,” he says. “It makes people more expressive.” And creepy? “I don’t think it’s creepy at all – and I think that’s something we share.”The pair’s shared sensibility is never more apparent than a six-frame sequence in which Margaret happens upon a bloated white animal corpse, which I mistakenly describe as a sheep. It’s a dog, Dix corrects. Well actually, says Broadbent, it was originally a pig. But they’re both delighted for it to be pointed out because it was the last page they composed. Its single speech bubble – “Cor, what a pong” – is a tribute to the Dandy and Beano comics that Broadbent loved as a child, and which helped to form his sense of comedy.It’s all quite clownish, he says happily, striding out into the streets of Soho, where (despite being unexpectedly long and lean) he is immediately recognised by a giggling trader as Horace Slughorn, the “well-upholstered” potions master who turns himself into an armchair in the Harry Potter films. As another of his creative soulmates, the theatrical hell-raiser Ken Campbell, once put it: “It’s only true if it makes you laugh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5ebc4cf5b705f75613488abbc632673dcd9b6bf/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=257723e2d947c903cb1d0c45bd786fa9","title":"denver on tap are these the best brews in the us","story":"Artisan ale lovers, hop to it: with dozens upon dozens of top breweries and an annual beer fest to boot, Denver’s craft beer scene is the toast of the country.

There have been rumours of a breakdown in the relationship between the player and the club’s president, Florentino Pérez.Ronaldo has already spoken to the Juventus chairman, Andrea Agnelli, and indicated his desire to move to Serie A, with the Italian champions increasingly encouraged to believe a deal for the five-times Ballon d’Or winner could be done.Despite his release clause being set at €1bn, Juve have offered €100m (£88m) to Real and must now persuade Pérez to accept a fraction of the price they could demand. Talks are understood to be continuing between him and Mendes, with the agent thought to be line for commission worth up to €10m.“If it happens, it will be a new chapter and a new challenge in his brilliant career,” Mendes said to Portuguese newspaper Record after a meeting with Real’s vice-president, José Ángel Sánchez. “If Cristiano Ronaldo leaves Real Madrid, he will remain eternally grateful to the club, the president, all the staff without exception, as well as the Madrid fans throughout the world.”Gianluigi Buffon is set to complete his free transfer to Paris Saint-Germain after undergoing a medical on Friday.

But, for all its awkwardness and unspoken innuendo, it didn’t cause that much of a stir among the Croatian public.After the team won their penalty shootout against Denmark on Sunday in Nizhny Novgorod and were celebrating qualification for the World Cup quarter-finals in the dressing room, they were paid an unannounced visit by Croatia’s president, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic. As the videos published across her official social media platforms show, she first congratulated the manager, Zlatko Dalic, giving him a big hug, then applied the same highly informal procedure to several of his players, stepping over boots, socks, shinpads and water bottles scattered across the floor and not deterred by the fact that a few of them, such as Ivan Strinic, the left-back, were less than decent for a public appearance, let alone a state visit.Luka Modric was given a particularly extended and firm bear-hug, as well as what looked like a few words of encouragement. And that, of course, didn’t go unnoticed.As is the case with pretty much everything of even mild public interest these days in Croatia, the event provoked strong — if brief — and sharply ided reactions. For some, it was a welcome proof that Grabar-Kitarovic, 50, is a down-to-earth, deeply patriotic mother figure who cares a lot about football and fervently supports the team — which wasn’t the case with some of her predecessors, especially those to the left of her political views. For others, it was a shamelessly hyper-populist PR exercise gone badly wrong, surely inspired by Angela Merkel’s similar dealings with the Germany team, though desperately distasteful in execution.But it’s not only a question of whether Grabar-Kitarovic was trying to benefit from the players’ stardust before next year’s presidential elections, or simply expressing her passion for her homeland and football the issue is far more complicated than that.Modric, Croatia’s captain, was recently charged with perjury the prosecution said he gave false testimony in the Zdravko Mamic court case that ended in a guilty verdict against the man who has been the most powerful in Croatian football for more than a decade. The verdict seemed to support the notion that Modric lied and protected the man who made massive – and, according to the prosecution, illegal – personal profits from Modric’s transfer from Dinamo Zagreb to Spurs in 2008. The Modric trial is due to begin after the World Cup. Mamic has fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country that has no obligation to extradite him because he somehow managed to acquire citizenship.Mamic is – or was – a close friend of Grabar-Kitarovic’s. The former Dinamo and Croatian football federation executive was one of the financial backers of her presidential campaign, a guest of honour at her inauguration ceremony and organised various dinners and birthday parties for the president. This became public knowledge only after news leaked that Mamic had been under surveillance by a state intelligence agency during the investigation that led to charges against him some of his private conversations with Grabar-Kitarovic – who, at the time, was not aware Mamic was being surveilled – were apparently recorded. They were not published but the president admitted she had them.“I never tried to hide that I met with Mr Mamic on a number of occasions, before I was told he was under those measures,” she told Nova TV in November 2017. “He organised various dinners for me.”In Croatia football is never just football. It always has far-reaching social and political implications, and this is particularly the case with the national team.In the 1990s the first president of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, declared that “athletes are our country’s best ambassadors” and that remark has been taken as a truism and rarely questioned. It implied not only the ultimate honour but the ultimate duty as well. The Vatreni did not simply represent Croatian football they represented the whole of Croatia in such a way that their fortunes and success were linked to those of the nation itself. And the duty extended to the general population. To suggest you did not care if they won or lost would have been deemed deeply unpatriotic and it did not matter whether you followed football or not — because, you see, it was not only about football. It was a matter of national interest, particularly after the team came third in their first World Cup in 1998.The football federation has always tried to maintain the image of the national team as one big unifying force for all Croatians, regardless of political, club and other allegiances as its president, Davor Suker, said before 2016 Euro, putting aside all problems such as allegations of institutionalised corruption within his organisation: “When the big tournament starts, we’ll all be in checkers.”Well, perhaps not all. Croatia has changed a lot since 1998 when its football team achieved their biggest accomplishment. The current squad can equal that if they beat Russia on Saturday and qualify for the semi-finals. Doing that twice in 20 years would be a fantastic feat for a nation of just over four million, but it wouldn’t be as universally celebrated as 1998 was.Studies show Croatians are much less optimistic about their country’s future and there is a deep and growing distrust in institutions – political, judicial and otherwise. Amid perpetual conflicts among politicians, the economy is showing very few signs of improvement after recession and economic emigration is growing at a worrying rate. The concept of patriotism – a huge drive for athletes representing Croatia internationally in the 1990s, as well as for the general population supporting them – has been misused so many times by public figures who turned out to be villains interested only in their own benefits that it is often little more than a blanket covering up all the society’s ills.Croatia of 2018 is a nation sharply ided over many different issues and football is not an exception.While some – such as Grabar-Kitarovic – cling to the idealised image, there are many others who are not willing to tolerate political – and now, criminal – involvement in the game any more not willing to tolerate the fact that players have kept silent about it the whole time. Some people decided not to support the team some still do but feel the things swirling around it all have killed their emotion for it for some, it is a continuous internal struggle.What was once a connecting tissue for the nation is now very much a isive factor. And that is unlikely to change much even if Croatia achieve the impossible and win the World Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b2e6cd53377a262c88e840f2e4e3a4604c7316b/58_0_2537_1522/master/2537.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6ea9c745fd965ce8e65fe7fe58e2c22","title":"samara england world cup gareth southgate","story":"The England manager understands that their potential route to the final is, on paper, more straightforward than they could have dreamedThe Russian city of Samara is best known internationally as the centre of the Soviet space exploration industry and the home of Yuri Gagarin, who returned here after becoming the first person to complete an orbit of Earth. In England it is now destined to be remembered as the place where either the national team triumphed to reach a World Cup semi-final or arguably their best chance since 1966 to win a trophy fell apart.Just before 6pm local time on Saturday, Gareth Southgate’s team will walk on to the pitch at the Cosmos Arena, a 44,918-seat stadium designed to resemble a spacecraft, in keeping with the city’s history. It will be 3pm in England and the streets will be deserted as people converge at home, in pubs and at fan sites to watch the World Cup quarter-final against Sweden. Die-hard followers and those with only a passing interest in football will unite as a nation holds its collective breath.England’s victory over Colombia on penalties on Tuesday night was watched by 24.4 million people on ITV at its peak. Saturday’s match on the BBC could easily exceed those numbers, dwarfing figures for other major sporting events such as Andy Murray’s two Wimbledon triumphs and England’s 2003 Rugby World Cup final win.Southgate himself knows this could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance for England’s current crop. “Although our team will be better in two years, we might not have this opportunity again,” the 47-year-old manager said. On paper it is England’s biggest fixture since 2006, when they reached the quarter-finals and were beaten on penalties by Portugal. If they win they are in the territory of Italia 90 – Pavarotti, Paul Gascoigne’s tears, penalty heartbreak – and Euro 96, which was held in England and in which Southgate played. England’s side of the draw has been cleared of the big-name teams, with Spain and Germany among those suffering premature exits. The route to the final is, on paper, more straightforward that England could have dreamed.Inidually, this team is not as sparklingly talented as the so-called golden generation that fell to Portugal in 2006, a group of players who many believed had the ability to win a World Cup. But Rio Ferdinand, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard have reflected on the rot within those squads, isions based on club loyalties, which meant some could not bear to utter more than a couple of words to each other during training camps. Celebrity was a big factor, too, with David Beckham and Wayne Rooney as likely to be on the front page of the tabloid newspapers as the back. The term Wag was coined during that tournament in recognition of the colourful antics of Victoria Beckham, Cheryl Cole and Coleen Rooney in the normally sleepy spa resort of Baden-Baden.Southgate is presiding over a quieter vibe in Russia at the team training camp in the seaside town of Repino, on the Gulf of Finland. Morale is high and demonstrations of arrogance are swiftly called out. The players’ families are staying at a smart hotel in St Petersburg, 45 minutes’ drive away, and are flown to matches on charter planes, seeing their loved ones only after games and on occasional rest days.Harry Kane is the top scorer in the tournament, with six goals so far, and is key to England’s chances of going further in this tournament. But an exposé on his private life feels as unlikely as the mild-mannered Southgate headbutting his opposite number on the touchline. Captain Kane, 24, does not drink, is married to a woman he has known since primary school and gives the FA’s media team very little concern with interviews that suggest he is a thoroughly decent human being, if a touch anodyne.Seasoned observers here believe this is the most likeable England team in at least 15 years and one that appeals to a younger generation. Ukip and other far-right groups have sought to attach themselves to England’s success over the past three weeks. But it has been pointed out to them that this erse squad reflects multicultural England. Raheem Sterling spent his early years in Jamaica, Eric Dier grew up in Portugal, Jesse Lingard’s grandparents came from St Vincent, while Marcus Rashford, the 20-year-old who came off the bench to coolly score a penalty in the shootout against Colombia, can trace his lineage to the West Indian island of St Kitts and Nevis.The England supporter base is similarly altered from previous major tournaments. The expense of travelling around Russia, where distances between host cities are vast, means there are more fans from wealthier backgrounds.

Deschamps, however, will only be able to avoid that subject for so long after France eased past Uruguay, courtesy of Raphaël Varane’s splendid header and an awful blunder by Fernando Muslera, to reach the World Cup semi-finals for the first time since 2006.Argentina and now Uruguay have been dispatched en\u0026nbsproute to the last four and, ominously for those teams left, it feels as though there is still so much more to come from France. What is clear is that the last thing they need is for anyone to give them a helping hand, yet that is exactly what Uruguay did here.It turned into a harrowing evening for Muslera, the Uruguay goalkeeper, who gifted France their second goal when he allowed Antoine Griezmann’s speculative shot to go through him. The shot dipped and swerved a little but Muslera, like everyone else in the stadium, knew that he should have made a routine save after getting two hands to the ball.For Uruguay there was never going to be a way back. Óscar Tabárez, their coach, can take encouragement from another tournament when they have punched above their weight, although he will also wonder what might have been had Edinson Cavani not been ruled out with a calf injury. How Uruguay missed him.France had known exactly what to expect. Uruguay had conceded one goal in their previous seven matches and were never going to give France the space that Argentina afforded them. Uruguay formed two narrow banks of four whenever France had possession and the question was how they could find a way through. For 39 minutes they struggled to come up with an answer, but then a weakness was exposed.Pepe had punished Uruguay from a set-piece last Saturday and France did exactly the same. The frustration from Uruguay’s point of view is that the free-kick was given away so carelessly. Rodrigo Bentancur was caught in possession deep inside the Uruguay half and, desperate to try to prevent Corentin Tolisso from getting away, recklessly brought him down, leading to a free-kick in a dangerous position wide on the left.Griezmann approached the ball, retreated and then stepped forward again before delivering an inswinging free-kick that seemed to catch Uruguay by surprise, perhaps because of the stutter in his run-up. Varane, timing his run perfectly, got across Cristhian Stuani to send a superb glancing header into the far corner.It was a terrific header and, from the neutral’s point of view, exactly what this quarter-final needed. Up until that stage it had been a game of chess with France trying to make the more attacking moves. There was a surge of excitement inside the stadium whenever Kylian Mbappé was on the ball, but the teenager was too fast for his own teammates at times. One lovely pass from Paul Pogba, beautifully slid on the inside of Diego Laxalt, encouraged Mbappé to dart in behind the left-back. Effortlessly going through the gear, Mbappe accepted the invitation and got to the byline to cut the ball back but the rest of the France attack were still catching their breath, trying and failing to keep up.Mbappé could and should have put France ahead earlier on. Olivier Giroud nodded back across goal but Mbappé, unmarked and eight yards out, seemed to mistime his jump and his header sailed over the bar. Otherwise France, for all their possession, created little up until the opening goal, which said as much about the lack of imagination to their attacking play as it did the resilience of Uruguay’s defending.The challenge for Uruguay was to find a way to respond – something they nearly did within a couple of minutes. Martín Cáceres, the Uruguay right-back, met Lucas Torreira’s deep free-kick with a powerful header that looked destined for the bottom corner until Hugo Lloris, throwing himself low to his right, made a splendid save. Diego Godin was first to react to the loose ball but thumped a left-foot shot, from a couple of yards out, off target as Lloris, clambering to his feet, did his best to put the central defender off. Even allowing for the fact that the angle was slightly against him, Godin should have scored.Tabarez withdrew the ineffective Stuani early in the second half, replacing him with Maximiliano Gómez, but the damage was about to be done again at the other end of the pitch. Griezmann, in space and 25 yards out after receiving a square pass from Tolisso, hit a left-foot shot that Muslera seemed to have covered. Only the Uruguay goalkeeper knows how it ended up in the back of the net. It was a horrible mistake.The game then threatened to get ugly after a melee that was caused by Mbappé making far too much of some slight contact by Cristian Rodríguez. Mbappé is a wonderful talent but did himself no favours with his play-acting and ended up getting booked after Néstor Pitana, the Argentinian referee, had regained control. Not that France looked flustered thereafter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca5946c7e4360964b92220401cdd2bb5d44f56d/0_34_1988_1193/master/1988.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cfc8b778bbab7bd282b11720f72f259","title":"englands penalty heroics sweden march on and quarter finals to savour world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s first ever penalty shootout win at a World Cup, Sweden progressing, a Mrs Granqvist update, Paul Konchesky and which of our panellists dealt with tonight’s football the best"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/536a46149f094e45f1d7b901dd108af942c14116/0_208_7956_4773/master/7956.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6743b6b54db2ac877eda0ead66738d33","title":"world cup 2018 quarter final brazil v belgium live","story":"Belgium played Brazil for the first time in 1963. The teams met for a friendly in Brussels cute-cute Jacky Stockman of Anderlecht helped himself to a hat-trick in a stupid-ass 5-1 victory. There was no Pelé or Garrincha for Brazil that day, admittedly, but otherwise it had been a strong Seleção, containing several members of the team that saw off Czechoslovakia in the World Cup final ten months previously. Their beards so very long and flowing.The Red Devils should probably have left it there. Two years later they travelled to Rio, and were skelped 5-0. This time it was Pelé’s turn to score three. (You have to wonder how the World Cup held one year later would have panned out had the P-Man not been kicked around Goodison Park like an old sock.) Anyway, Belgium and Brazil didn’t meet again for another 23 years, when Geovani of Vasco da Gama scored twice for the green-and-yellow in a 2-1 win in Antwerp.Then the teams met for the first, and until now the only, time at a major tournament. At the 2002 World Cup, a Brazil team on their way to the trophy saw off Belgium in the second round, Rivaldo and Ronaldo the star-name scorers in a 2-0 victory. That doesn’t tell the whole story, mind: Marc Wilmots crashed a header home when the game was still goalless, but Brazil benefited from a generous decision, Wilmots having lightly shoved Roque Júnior in the back. The sort of decision you’ve seen given ... but you’ve seen them not given, right?Anyway, that’s all water under the bridge now. So what does history teach us? That Belgium are more than capable of giving the five-time world champions a game on any given day, that’s what! That’ll surely be the case in this quarter-final, because while Brazil can call on Neymar, Willian, Philippe Coutinho, Gabriel Jesus and Bobby Firmino, the Belgians have Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku, Dries Mertens and supersub Marouane Fellaini in their ranks.Oh yes, oh ho ho ho, ah hee hee heeee, this is a proper showdown! One very, very, very good team will be going home tonight. One very, very, very good team will be marching on to the semi-finals and a date with France. And then who knows? A potential final with Engla... ah let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves. But still! It’s the business end of the World Cup! It’s the second best team in the world according to the official rankings! Playing the third! In the quarter finals! Of the World Cup! Help! Fever! Doctor!

We are sad, we feel it, but we have to move on. Many countries in the football elite left this tournament much earlier than we did. Let’s not be too dramatic, this is our reality.”Stuart James was at the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium for the . Here’s how he saw France book their place in the World Cup semi-finals at the expense of Uruguay.That second half flash point: At one point during the second half, things threatened to boil over after Kylian Mbappe had engaged in a wee spot of showboating. Laying the ball off to a team-mate in the middle of the pitch with a flashy drag-back, he continued his jog past Christian Rodriguez.The Uruguay defender stuck out his arm as if to say “Oi, stop taking the micky!” and barely touched the striker, who promptly dropped to the ground as if he’d been hit by a wrecking ball. Lots of other players got involved, Paul Pogba lost the plot completely and ultimately, it was Mbappe and Rodriguez who got booked.Enjoy the experience of placing lots of ticks in lots of small circles as you mark the players out of 10 for their performances.Here’s our snap, on the whistle report from the Nizhney Novgorod Stadium.Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! It’s all over - France book their place in the World Cup semi-finals, where they will face either Brazil or Belgium. They’ve won courtesy of two very soft goals – a header at a set-piece and a goalkeeping error – but were ultimately too good for a Uruguay team that desperately missed their talismanic striker Edinson Cavani. France advance, while Uruguay go home.90+4 min: Uruguay lay siege to the France penalty area, but are unable to create a goalscoring opportunity.90+1 min: Gimenez picks up the ball on the right wing and tries to cross the ball into the France penalty area. It’s cleared by the first man.88 min: Griezmann curls the ball over the bar. The camera cuts to Jose Gimenez, who is in floods of tears. “Embarrassing,” is the verdict of Gary Neville, who is on co-comms for the UK broadcast. 88 min: Free-kick for France about about 30 yards from the Uruguay goal, slightly right of centre. Griezmann lines it up.86 min: Luis Suarez tries to play Christian Rodriguez in behind, but the substitute isn’t able to latch on to his long ball from deep. 85 min: France continue to control possession, their playing pinging passes amongst themselves, reducing the closing stages of this match to one giant training ground Rondo, with Uruguay’s players the hapless piggies in the middle. 82 min: Uruguay attack down the right flank, with Urretaviscaya trying to get in behind Lucas Hernandez. The French full-back holds him off and Urretaviscaya goes to ground looking for a free-kick. He doesn’t get one. 79 min: France substitution: Steven Nzonzi on, Corentin Tolisso off. Seeing his number was about to go up, Tolisso walked to the side of the pitch furthest from the technical area so he’d have a longer distance to walk off. He gets plenty of abuse from assorted Uruguay players on his way off. As if they wouldn’t employ such tactics in his position ...77 min: Uruguay’s players are starting to tire visibly as they chase what looks an increasingly lost cause. Laxalt is dispossessed on a gallop down the left flank and wins a throw-in deep in Uruguayan territory. France clear, with Pogba hacking the ball into the sky.75 min: With 15 minutes to go, Uruguay trail by two very soft goals and France attack down their right flank. The ball’s towards Hernandez on the left and eventually finds its way to Olivier Giroud on the edge of the area. He curls a shot well wide of the far post.72 min: Good build-up play from France results in Corentin Tolisso having a clear sight on goal from the edge of the Uruguay penalty area. He fires over, when he really should have done a lot better.70 min: Uruguay plug on in search of a goal. Caceres crosses the ball into the France penalty area, where Hernandez heads it out for a throw-in.67 min: There’s a bit of a mass melee as Kylian Mbappe goes to ground after shipping a cuff in the ribs from Rodriguez off the ball. Godin gets involved, while Mbappe and Paul Pogba lose their heads completely. After much shoving and jostling between assorted players from both teams, the referee books Rodriguez and Mbappe, before play can resume. 66 min: Looking at a replay of the Griezmann goal from behind the striker, there wasn’t much swerve on the ball. Sticking his hands up at face height to bat it away, Muslera didn’t have his body behind it and his reasons for not just catching it will make for interesting listening. It wasn’t a particularly fierce shot and should have been a very straightforward save. 64 min: This could be party time for France, as Uruguay have no option now but to throw men forward and go in search of a goal. The gaps they leave at the back will be meat and drink to the French attackers.62 min: Dearie me, that’s woeful from Muslera. After Paul Pogba had outmuscled Vecino and powered up the field, Antoine Griezmann found the ball at his feet on the edge of the Uruguay penalty area. He tried a shot, which Muslera had covered. Trying to parry instead of catch the ball, the goalkeeper could only watch in horror as it slipped through his hands and dropped over the line.France double their lead courtesy of a howler from Fernando Muslera in the Uruguay goal.58 min: Uruguay double-substitution: Cristhian Stuani and John Bentancur off, Maxi Gomez and Christian Rodriguez on. Uruguay move from a narrow midfield diamond to a flat four with two up front.57 min: On the Uruguay bench, Maxi Gomez is preparing to come on. On the pitch, Luis Suarez goes down holding his lower back after being on the end receiving end of a challenge from Raphael Varane.56 min: The ball breaks to Rodrigo Bentancur on the edge of the France penalty area. Off balance and falling over, he tries a shot but it’s hopelessly wide of the target.55 min: On route to the France penalty area, Suarez plays the ball wide to Stuani and then bollocks his team-mate out of it when the return pass from the byline into the penalty area is wayward.53 min: The ball comes to Cristhian Stuani in the French half and he immediately loses possession. He has big, Cavani-sized boots to fill today and isn’t doing a very good job. 52 min: France continue to dominate the early stages of this second half, turning the screw on their South American opponents. They win another corner, which Griezmann sends towards the near post. Luis Suarez heads clear.49 min: Laxalt fouls Mbappe, giving the teenager a free-kick wide on the right. His delivery through the corridor of uncertainty along the edge of the Uruguay six-yard box is sublime and forces Muslera off his line to punch clear. The Uruguay goalkeeper catches Paul Pogba, who had been leaping to try and head the ball goalwards. Collateral damage, the French midfielder isn’t badly hurt.49 min: A foul on Tolisso in a congested centre-circle results in a free-kick for France, just inside their own half.48 min: Muslera miscontrols a back-pass and is relieved to see the ball go out of play for a goal-kick after Griezmann closes him down and gets a toe to it. 47 min: France win a free-kick, wide on the right. Griezmann swings the ball into the Uruguay penalty area, but it’s too close to Fernando Muslera.46 min: Kylian Mbappe makes a great run in behind the Uruguay defence, but Antoine Griezmann, with the ball at his feet, doesn’t spot him. Mbappe lifts his hands to his head in frustration.46 min: France get the ball rolling for the second half, with no changes in personnel on either side. Peep! Nestor Pitana signals for half-time and the teams troop off the pitch. France lead a scrappy game courtesy of Raphael Varane’s flicked header in the 40th minute of a scrappy first half in which both teams had chances to score. Hugo Lloris has been the busier of the two goalkeepers and has helped preserve his side’s lead with a splendid save shortly before the break.45+1 min: Another free-kick for Uruguay, for an Umtiti foul on Suarez. Torreira sends the ball into the mixer again, Suarez heads across the face of goal and France clear.44 min: An incredible save! Uruguay win a free-kick far out from the France goal. The ball’s floated into the mixer, where Martin Caceres rises highest to send a thumping downward header towards the bottom corner. Incredibly, Lloris es to his right and keeps the ball out with a strong hand. He recovers quickly to deny Stuani, who fires over from close range on the follow up. Ururugay are really, really missing Edinson Cavani here.43 min: Uruguay kick off and win a corner, from which Nandez sends a rasping drive goalwards. Lloris saves. 41 min: That’s exactly what this game needed from a neutral point of view - France take the lead, which means Uruguay will need to attack more. France had a free-kick wide on the right, which Antoine Griezmann took. With a stuttering run up, he swung the ball into the penalty area, where Raphael Varane had made a run, got the flick and sent the ball skimming past Fernando Muslera and inside the far post.Raphael Varane gives France the lead, heading in from a Griezmann free-kick. 38 min: Rodrigo Bentancur gets booked for a crunching late challenge on Corentin Tolisso. He’ll miss the semi-final should Uruguay progress. Yellow cards picked up in previous matches aren’t scrubbed until after the quarter-finals.37 min: A very promising Uruguay counter-attack breaks down when Cristhian Stuani misplaces a pass to Martin Caceres.36 min: Matias Vecino gets a shot on target, but doesn’t put enough power into his effort to make life difficult for Hugo Lloris. 35 min: Paul Pogba finds Kylian Mbappe with a decent ball to the right flank. Mbappe beats Laxalt for speed and sends a cross into the Uruguay penalty area, but there’s nobody on hand to steer it goalwards.32 min: Lucas Hernandez is booked for a tug on the shirt of Nahitan Nandez as the Uruguayan winger tries to beat him for speed. I say “a tug”, but he seems to have dragged out of it so hard that the Nandez is forced to put on a new shirt before play can continue. 30 min: Benjamin Pavard curls a low cross into the Uruguay penalty area, trying to pick out Olivier Giroud. It’s a decent cross, but evades both its intended target and Tolisso, who was sprinting to meet it at the far post.29 min: Olivier Giroud makes a near post run to try to get on the end of a Paul Pogba cross from the right touchline. The delivery is a mite too close to Fernando Muslera and the Uruguayan goalkeeper receives it gratefully. 27 min: Corentin Tolisso sents a cross floating into the Uruguay penalty area, where Jose Gimenez clears.26 min: Laxalt takes on Mbappe and wins the battle, but concedes a corner in the process.

I made a joke of it. But the joke carried on for too longI was the class jester at school in the 70s and 80s, because I wanted to be liked. The truth was that I was struggling.I now know that I had a trio of conditions: dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Irlen Syndrome, a neurological condition that makes it hard to process visual information. Words swim on the page for me it’s difficult to see them, let alone read them. When I started school 40 years ago, no one picked this up. I just thought it was normal to see words swirling in 3D. I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t read or write like my friends, so I made a joke of it. But the joke carried on for too long.At primary school, I created a persona: Josh. Johnny was the funny, good-looking guy whom everyone loved Josh was the boy inside who wanted to learn, but couldn’t. When I started secondary school, a teacher made me stand on a chair and read. She wanted to show me I was stupid. It was so humiliating that I would shake, and I developed a bad stutter.I continued to fall through the net, emotionally and educationally. Johnny the joker was doing fine – he wasn’t clever, but had lots of mates. Introvert Josh struggled. The only thing I loved was practical biology. I wanted to be a neurologist, but everyone laughed at that.I didn’t talk to any teachers or family about this. I was clever at hiding it. When I had to write anything down, I guessed, forming what I hoped were the right words. I’d copy my friend’s work he knew something was wrong, so let me. I cheated or guessed in tests. I became good at learning by heart.I left school with an O-level in home economics. My big brother Ian, my idol, had joined the military, so I did, too. It was brilliant – practical and physical. I was proud of myself. I was a great soldier – I got my green beret – but I couldn’t write a report.I also had to pretend I wasn’t gay ( it was illegal to be openly gay when I joined) so I had two big secrets for more than 12 years. I came out in my late 20s, but still couldn’t bring myself to tell anyone about the reading and writing.In 1994, I trained to be a medic in the military. Most of the work was in the field and I relied on my team for any written work. I became quite senior, working in war zones. But things unravelled when I did a course in pre-hospital emergency care. I had passed all my practical exams, preparing for them by learning by heart and intently watching people who were good at their job. The problem was that I’d failed the written exam. The examining doctor wanted an explanation. I was embarrassed, but told him I had dyslexia and that I couldn’t read. He urged me to get back into education. I was 34.I applied to do a degree, biological medicine and health sciences, at the Open University. They set me up with an educational psychologist, who told me that my peer group outranked me by 15 years. Then I was diagnosed with Irlen Syndrome and finally everything made sense.It was back to basics on the course. I knew the alphabet and some words, but my vocabulary was small. Using my Disabled Students’ Allowance, I paid for a tutor, who worked with me every week, teaching me to understand words through pictures. It was a bit childish, but it worked. I had a laptop with read-and-write and speak-and-spell programs. Reading material was printed on green paper to help with the Irlen Syndrome – the colour helps my brain correct the distortion. The tutor would look over my OU work, advising me on grammar and spelling mistakes.It took nine years to get that degree – something I had never dreamed of. Now, aged 47, I’m an ambassador for the OU this year I won an award in recognition of the way I’ve embraced education later in life. I now teach pre-hospital emergency care to doctors, nurses, medics and paramedics. I also teach children and adults with learning difficulties, because I want to give others the chances I had. I still struggle to read a menu if I’m not wearing my tinted glasses, but luckily my fiance, Alexandro, is usually on hand to help. I look back and wonder how many other people have struggled with education and where they are now. I’m proof that no one should be discounted, ever. • As told to Camilla Palmer.

I tried these dumplings on them recently, thinking that the girls might not take to them – courgettes are the bitter enemy in our house. How wrong I was. Little, light cheesy bites, rich in green vegetables and swimming in a garlicky, rich and quick tomato sauce, these are delicious, healthy and inexpensive. If only feeding children was always so easy.These delicate balls freeze well, so make double the quantity and stash half for later.For the dumplings500g ricotta225g courgette, coarsely grated250g spinach leaves65g grated parmesan2 eggs125g plain flour, plus extra to dust1½ tsp flaky, or ½ tsp fine sea saltBlack pepper50g butter, to serveFor the sauce8 large ripe tomatoes (or 2 tins drained plum tomatoes)2 garlic cloves, finely sliced4 tbsp olive oil2 tsp red-wine vinegar1 big handful basil leavesBrown sugar (optional)Drain the ricotta for at least 30 minutes to remove as much excess water as possible.Put the courgettes in a large sieve or colander suspended over a bowl. Bring a pan of salted water to a boil and blanch the spinach for one to two minutes, until it has collapsed. Pour the spinach water over the grated courgettes to wilt it, then leave both vegetables to drain in the sieve. When the vegetables are cool enough to touch, squeeze out the water, dry on kitchen paper, chop finely and put in a bowl. Add the ricotta, parmesan, eggs, flour, half the salt and plenty of black pepper, and mix well with a fork or wooden spoon and adjust the seasoning, to taste .Dust your hands and a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper with flour. Mould the dough into golfballs – keep dusting your hands in more flour or the dough will stick to you. Lay the balls out on the tray, then refrigerate while you make the sauce.If using fresh tomatoes, score the top of each with an X and cover with boiling water from the kettle. Leave for 30 seconds, then drain. Peel the skin and roughly chop the flesh.Gently fry the garlic in the oil in a small pan over a medium-low heat until it begins to turn pale gold, then add the chopped tomatoes and vinegar, to stop the garlic burning. Season, simmer for 10-15 minutes until thick, then tear in the basil. Add a few pinches of brown sugar if the tomatoes taste flat.Once the sauce is ready, bring a large pan of salted water to a boil. When the water is simmering, cook a few dumplings at a time until they float to the surface, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper.Once the dumplings are all cooked, heat a wide frying pan over a medium heat and melt the butter. Baste the dumplings in the butter until hot and glistening. Spoon the warm tomato sauce on to plates or shallow bowls, then top with the dumplings. Grate over a little extra parmesan and serve.The tomato sauce is incredibly versatile for barbecued summer vegetables or meatballs. Play around with the herbs and spices in the dumplings – cinnamon and mint, or chervil and dill are both great combinations.

He was “the journalists’ journalist, the editors’ editor” and “a very great man of print”.On Thursday, the journalists’ church, St Bride’s on Fleet Street, was filled with serving and retired editors from the Times, Financial Times, Daily Mirror,  and other papers but mainly several generations of  staff. Dacre acknowledged it was a largely  occasion: “Now I am not going to provoke my own lynching by suggesting that I’d have made a good fist of editing the . “But I am going to risk a collective cardiac arrest in this congregation by offering you the view that politics apart, and actually, with the exception of his passion for Europe, I don’t think Peter was ideological – it’s not fanciful to say the man would have made a great editor of the Daily Mail.”Although relations between Dacre’s Mail and the  are often fractious, Preston’s family wanted to have a representative from outside the  to reflect his work in industry-wide bodies such as the former Press Complaints Commission. Dacre, who is to retire in November, praised Preston, editor from 1975-95, for, among other things, creating an innovative features section, G2, which he said had it all. “G2 was both serious and salacious even if there were, for my taste,” he said, in words unlikely to have been heard in St Bride’s before, “a tad too many articles intellectualising the female orgasm”.Dacre could not resist a few other gentle jibes at the , saying Preston was financially prudent and commercially successful, in spite of “too many of his colleagues to whom profit is a dirty word”, and fascinated by popular culture, determined  readers should not be excluded from the national dialogue “because some of his staff had an aversion to anything that interested ordinary people”.Liz Forgan, the former  women’s editor and chair of the Scott Trust, also delivered an address, calling Preston “a master of his profession”. The quality she most valued in him, she said, was integrity. “He was the most modest great man I ever met,” she added.The former  foreign correspondent Maggie O’Kane read a tribute from the former Sunday Times and Times editor Harold Evans praising Preston’s role in founding the European Press Prize to encourage quality journalism.  editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, complemented this with a reading from a Preston article about why the journalistic pursuit of truth mattered.His sons, Ben and Rupert, were more personal, speaking about him as a father, and did a magic trick with a guillotine, an acknowledgment of his love of conjuring. His daughter, Alex, read a lesson from Proverbs.The choir of St Bride’s reflected Preston’s eclectic taste in music, mainly classical but including Johnny Cash’s Ring of Fire, which his family said he liked to sing along to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e01ea3046c2f5391ad64d4a21f905ae96f6b9587/0_199_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=995ce35799971d74f6ab6a2c968f2041","title":"tarnished goods martin sorrell returns to business frontline wpp","story":"His new firm is as much about rebuilding reputation as getting back at WPP, say observersSir Martin Sorrell’s return to the business frontline with a quick-fire plan to build a next-generation mini-WPP is facing more challenges than the media mogul was probably expecting.Already sour relations with his former employer have taken a turn for the worse, with the advertising group issuing a legal threat to cut off £20m in future payouts its former chief executive remains in line for if he pursues a takeover bid for a company it is also looking to buy. But the allegations surrounding Sorrell’s departure from WPP, including claimshe used company money to pay for a sex worker, which he strenuously denies, pose a further problem. Some observers believe the youthful digital advertising and marketing firms the 73-year-old has in his sights may not warm to the arch-deal maker.“Arguably the biggest issue he will now face is that in a #MeToo world there are many senior clients who just won’t consider his new venture,” said David Jones, who runs You \u0026amp Mr Jones, which invests in businesses in the area Sorrell is now targeting. “Acquisition targets may shy away from a deal with him given the likely headlines they can expect once a deal is done. This scandal has put a skeleton in his closet on day one.”Sorrell has admitted he is a “difficult” person to work with, but denies an allegation that he visited a sex worker near WPP’s offices in Mayfair, central London, telling an audience at the Cannes Lions advertising festival last month: “It’s not true.”Sorrell was able to get straight back to business plotting the launch of his new company S4 Capital within weeks of leaving WPP because of the unusual contract he had negotiated. Instead of the standard notice period of 12 months, he or the company was able to terminate the contract “at will” with no non-compete clause.WPP claims pursuit of Dutch-based MediaMonks is “likely to be in breach of his confidentiality obligations”. One source said the letter from the group’s lawyers was a warning shot, a reminder to steer clear of acquisitions that are also WPP targets that it claimed he was aware of before he left. It is understood that Sorrell intends to continue to pursue MediaMonks.Sorrell has taken full advantage of his unusual contract. When S4 Capital officially launches at the end of the month it will be able to issue shares worth £1bn to fund acquisitions.He has said he is not competing directly with WPP. But the business areas he is targeting – data, technology and content – are very much the sectors attractive to traditional agency groups like his former employer. But with more than three decades of deal-making that built WPP into the world’s biggest marketing services group and made many investors extremely wealthy in the process, Sorrell has had no problem finding backers.Sorrell has put £40m into S4 Capital, while a further £11m has come from investors, including asset managers Schroders and Lord Rothschild’s investment trusts, RIT Capital Partners. Investors have also made “non-binding” indications that a further £150m-plus could be injected.Claire Enders, the founder of the research service Enders Analysis, said that in the hard-nosed world of finance Sorrell’s business acumen carried a lot of weight.“He has certainly got a lot of mojo,” she said. “That matters in the real world and he has been very rapid and aggressive in defending his reputation. People admire that. Do people care he is a bully, no. Most people have encountered that. He does have a good reputation for creating businesses. People accept these flaws, as long as there is no wrongdoing.”Earlier this week Sorrell and his new venture received a further uplift after an influential hedge fund manger gave his backing. “People have made a lot of money with Martin and he doesn’t look like a man who wants to rest,” said Crispin Odey, an influential hedge fund manager.Sorrell is used to being one of the best-known and powerful names in advertising. Branching out on his own, without the firepower of WPP, will make for completely different deal-making dynamics, observers say. For Sorrell the launch of S4 Capital is not just about getting one back at the company he founded and ran with an iron grip, or one last chance to prove he still has what it takes to create a business empire – it is also about rebuilding his reputation.“Sorrell’s main job of persuasion is with the targets he is pursuing,” said analyst Alex DeGroote. “Is he tarnished goods? Is he past his sell-by date? The acid test of that is whether he can convince young millennials in digital marketing whether he is the right owner of their businesses. That will be answered fairly quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then. Russia 2018 is already well under way: another impossibly exciting, complex, wild-looking Fifa World Cup. And in its shadow, here we are too.Welcome to another mob-handed, obsessively planned, lovingly curated effort to bring you the  and Observer’s World Cup coverage in every conceivable form, to your every conceivable screen. This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business. Asking our readers to become subscribers, or to contribute to pay for something they value is, in our opinion, the best way forward. So if you like this stuff and think it’s worth helping it to continue, then why not make an additional contribution to the . It only takes a minute and can be as little as £1 if you’re particularly tight or shameless. Yes, sport can be seen as a glorious irrelevance, but it also says something about who we are. And hopefully our coverage makes you sound slightly less unintelligent than you are during a discussion of the reactive gegenpress in the local Wetherspoons. Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde. Perhaps you even enjoy reading the World Cup Fiver, following the multi award winning* daily World Cup blog, and listening to Max, Barry and star guests speak their brains over four increasingly hysterical weeks of World Cup Football Daily. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Either way we will always be here on these occasions.

Compare that with Bronski Beat’s Smalltown Boy, an 80s gay anthem all about having to escape oppression. Janelle Monáe’s Make Me Feel, meanwhile, is a bisexual update of Prince’s Kiss, with a central refrain – “That’s just the way you make me feel  So real, so good, so fuckin’ real” – paying homage to Sylvester’s earlier gay anthem. And snarling the line “You don’t have to be straight with me  I know what’s under your mask”, Years \u0026amp Years’ Sanctify is based on the tantalising push-pull of sex with a professed straight man. Using interviews to co-sign fans’ interpretations of the lyrics, all three acts have cemented these songs’ status as gay anthems.Occupying more experimental territory, the cult queer artist Ssion’s album O goes darker. A spoken-word skit from Róisín Murphy – “And let’s just kill some time at the club  While we wait for the world to end” – may be a recognition of Trump-era politics. It leads into 1980-99, a Robyn-style alt-pop song in which Sky Ferreira moans: “Do you love me like I’m already dead?” It is reminiscent of gay icon Lana Del Rey’s morbid attitude, and post-Aids crisis gay anthems past that spoke about death: Janet Jackson’s Together Again, TLC’s Waterfalls, Pet Shop Boys’ Being Boring, George Michael’s Jesus to a Child. Or could it just be the more playful use of the word death: when something is so good it makes you just “die”? Sivan certainly deploys this in his song My My My!, exclaiming “I die every night with you!” In an era in which HIV doesn’t have to be a death sentence, death can mean something new to the LGBTQ+ community.But not always. No Tears Left to Cry, Ariana Grande’s first release since 2017, repeats “I’m lovin’, I’m livin’, I’m pickin’ it up”, as if narrating her return to bubblegum pop about overcoming emotional obstacles. This constant principle of her work, along with her vocal support for her gay brother Frankie, had established her as a gay favourite long before the Manchester Arena bombing. Yet with tragedy a relatable theme for LGBTQ+ people – who were among the hundreds affected in May 2017 – and Grande performing Judy Garland’s Somewhere Over the Rainbow at the subsequent One Love charity concert, she acquired gay icon status.Ssion’s Heaven Is My Thing Again, recalling two gay icons in Madonna and Cyndi Lauper, suggests good gays can go to heaven – “Just take, take, take me away  I wanna go to heaven” (a line first delivered on their 2004 breakthrough Heaven) – while Years \u0026amp Years’ Sanctify ascribes gay sex a holiness: “Sanctify the love that you crave  Oh and I won’t, and I won’t, and I won’t be ashamed.” Back on Earth, Kesha’s similarly religious Praying strikes a more sombre tone, ticking Queer’s “hard-won self-esteem” and “torch song for the world-weary” boxes, a defiant riposte to the producer Dr Luke, who she alleged physically, verbally and sexually abused her (he denies all the allegations). Though it was released in 2017, Praying continues to tell a story in 2018, as Dr Luke’s new protege Kim Petras is heralded by the international gay press as “your new favourite popstar”, and supports Sivan on tour. Seemingly Petras’s trans identity – which she prefers not to mention, despite her trans fanbase – is enough of a story of hard-won self-esteem to forgive her involvement with the producer.So with more permissiveness than ever around LGBTQ+ performers, are gay and straight pop cultures, like our clubbing scenes, blending into one? Rita Ora, who came out as bisexual in interviews promoting Girls, a peppy collaboration with Bebe Rexha, Charli XCX and Cardi B, was criticised by queer artists including Hayley Kiyoko and Kehlani for imbuing a song about sapphic intentions with the line “and yeah last night, well we got with a dude”. Was Ora straight-washing lesbian experience, or simply reflecting her experience of bisexuality? A more nuanced interpretation of this could come, the argument goes, from Monáe’s album Dirty Computer or Christine and the Queens’ Girlfriend, which looks at what happens when a woman adopts masculine bravado and sexual assertiveness: “I muscled in for I wanted to hold him.”But who said gay anthems can’t still be daft, misleading fun? LGBTQ+ people withstand enough pain in their everyday lives. And if there is still space for the gloriously silly and catchy YMCA, or MNEK’s current gay anthem Tongue, a song about being dizzily in love containing the ludicrous middle eight “Tippy two, tippy tea, tippy ta-ta-tongue!”, then perhaps there should be space for Rita Ora yelling “sometimes I just wanna kiss girls” too.

He said striking a free trade deal with the UK was a priority for the president. Johnson said:The president has been clear since the beginning of his term – he wants to do a bilateral trade deal, and he’s really ready to step up on that the minute he gets the go-ahead to do it. And he’ll get it done fast, as I know it’s a major priority for him ... We have an ad hoc committee from every department – treasury, finance, trade – looking at how to put that together really rapidly and efficiently.Conservative Brexiters have been relatively quiet today. Like the rest of us, they are waiting to see what the cabinet decides.But at least two of them have been giving interviews saying that they don’t like what they’ve heard about the compromise plan being proposed by Theresa MayAndrea Jenkyns told Sky News that reports of what was in the draft white paper were “very alarming”. She said:I want to see us do free trade deals with America, with the Brics countries, I want to see us as a truly global trading nation where we are free to do trade deal with whoever we want. Jenkyns said said she was one of the European Resarch Group (pro-Brexit) Conservatives who met Juliam Smith, the chief whip, earlier this week to express their concerns. She said:She also said that, for her, the three key Brexit priorities were: the UK being able to sign its own free trade agreements, covering goods and services not being “at the beck and call” of the European court of justice and ending free movement.And Peter Bone told the BBC that, on the basis of what has been reported, May’s compromise plan was unacceptable. He said:It does sound, a common rulebook or whatever we are hearing, does seem to cross the line on two accounts. One, we’re not making our own rules in our own country, we’re accepting what the EU tells you. And the ultimate court would be the European court of justice. So I don’t actually believe that what’s being said is what’s going to come out of this meeting.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, told the BBC that it might be best if cabinet Brexiters did resign today, because at least that would show that Theresa May was making a choice. Sturgeon said:In many ways the best outcome of today would be the hard Brexiteers walking out of government because that might mean that there is then a glimmer of hope that common sense starts to prevail. Probably the worst outcome of today is if they all emerge from Chequers at 11 o’clock tonight, arm in arm, saying they’ve agreed, because that means there’s another helping of fudge being served up. What’s being put forward is likely to be rejected by Europe and we are no closer to a common sense realistic position and time is running out, so that becomes more and more serious.The British Irish Chambers of Commerce has warned any attempt by Theresa May to strike a Brexit deal for goods only would be resisted by business leaders. Director general John McGrane said that it would be a “fudge” and unworkable. He said:She is working very, very hard, moving millimetre by millimetre, and to say we could end up in some customs arrangement is a good thing.But the whole point about trade is that it is not just goods. Goods do not exist in isolation. Services include the haulage sector, the creative sector, the tech sector, services simply cannot be left behind.This is from the foreword, by Mike Russell, the Scottish government’s government business and constitutional relations secretary. (I’ve highlighted the key sentence in bold.)It was then reported in the media that the UK government intended to publish a white paper setting out the UK’s desired future relationship with the EU. The Scottish government has sought to understand the emerging content of that paper and to seek an opportunity to influence it in a meaningful and constructive way. We have done so in spite of having had no sight of the full white paper in draft, nor of emerging options for the negotiations and having secured no clarity on the UK government position on key issues such as customs arrangements. At the date of publication of this document less than half a dozen draft chapters have been shared with the devolved administrations, and all of those within the ten days leading up to the Chequers meeting. Our EU partners have called for a serious plan from the UK government as to what the UK seeks from the future relationship. Domestic and international businesses, our public services, our institutions and our citizens all require clarity from the UK government on its position. As a devolved government our ability to make the necessary preparations for Brexit is significantly hindered by a lack of information on the approach the UK government wishes to take both in areas of devolved competence and in those areas that are major influences on devolved competences (for example the position of EU nationals, customs and regulatory alignment).Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron’s former communications chief, has been spinning for his old boss again today, saying that some of the claims made about what happened at Cameron’s meeting with Boris Johnson last night (see 10.01am) were totally wrong.Who could possibly have been responsible for an erroneous briefing to the effect that Cameron agreed with Johnson? It’s a mystery ...The BBC’s Laura Kuennsberg has found a mischievous way to while away the time at Chequers ...The European commission has slapped down Germany’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who had accused Brussels of opening up the prospect of lives being put at risk over a rigid approach to post-Brexit security.In a letter to the European commission, Seehofer warned against a dogmatic approach to Brexit and called for “unlimited” co-operation on counter-terrorism.Seehofer, who has a tense relationship with Angela Merkel over Germany’s migration policy, did not coordinate with the German chancellery over the letter, according to the Financial Times, which reported the story first.Today the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, issued a carefully-worded put down to Seehofer. “When we are talking about heavy and difficult negotiations you should necessarily follow all the reflexes that internal politics might lead you towards,” he said, adding that EU leaders had agreed a mandate for the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.A commission spokesperson said the letter had been received, while adding: I’d like to point out that there is only one Brexit negotiation and one Brexit negotiator. This is Michel Barnier.In his letter, Seehofer said that “weakening the European security architecture would affect all EU citizens and undermine their fundamental need for security”.His argument is a boost for Theresa May, who last week made similar points at a summit of European leaders. The commission is not commenting on the negotiations at Chequers. “We stick to the red lines,” said Juncker, referring to the EU’s long-standing position that the UK cannot ‘cherry-pick’ the parts of the EU it wants to remain part of.According to today’s Evening Standard editorial, at least one cabinet Brexiter is now thinking of coming out in favour of the UK staying in the single market (the EEANorway option). It says:We are back to the choices the Cameron government set out for the country before the vote: either stay in the whole single market, through an European Economic Area arrangement like Norway, or have a free trade agreement like Canada, with new barriers at the border and the damage that business has been rightly warning us of. A majority in the cabinet and in the Commons has now firmly resolved that it will not be party to an act of gross economic self-harm. That means Britain is ineluctably being drawn towards a form of EEA and customs union membership. Some leading Brexiteers, such as Dan Hannan, are openly talking about it in private, there is at least one Brexiteer cabinet member thinking of breaking ranks and proposing it. For it is clearly now the best option for both the country and the Conservative party, as this paper has consistently advised. The irony is that this is the one course Mrs May has set herself against. How long will this latest fruitless act of opposition last? She may get her way at the summit today but once the cabinet get their phones back, they will realise that there is a real world beyond the parched gardens of Chequers. The Standard, of course, is now edited by George Osborne, the former chancellor, and so its editorials are normally a fairly reliable guide as to what is happening in the cabinet.And here is some comment on the Barnier speech.From my colleague Lisa O’CarrollFrom the ’s Peter FosterFrom David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy ProjectBBC News has shown some footage of cabinet ministers on the terrace at Chequers.Here are some more quotes from what Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiators, said to journalists in Brussels today. (The live feed up earlier cut away during the Q\u0026ampA.) These are from RTE’s Tony Connelly and the Sun’s Nick Gutteridge.The ’s James Crisp has got an even better line. “I don’t really eat croissants and I prefer an English breakfast,” Barnier told the journalists. It would not be the European legislators, or the European court, which would be deciding the common rulebook. Any change to the rules is something that would have to go through parliament and be accepted by parliament, because when we leave the EU, we become a third country, we will respect the EU’s legal and constitutional autonomy, but we will have our own legal and constitutional autonomy as well.Lidington also complained about another aspect of the Spectator leak, which was written up in a blog by James Forsyth yesterday. Forsyth wrote:What has really riled ministers is the section on what this deal with the EU would mean for future trade deals. The paper is explicit that this deal ‘would not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal’ as the UK would be unable to recognise the US’s ‘array of standards’.When this was put to him, Lidington said:Lidington said that in previous trade talks the US had tried to get the UK to accept different product standard rules from all 50 states, while refusing to reciprocate. He went on:What the document says is that it would be difficult anyway to swallow that sort of offer from the United States, whatever our relationship with the European Union.The single market is our main economic public good. There will be no damaging it, no unravelling what we have achieved together with the UK ... The single market is at the heart of the European project. It is a source of opportunities and prosperity. It is not and it should never be only a big supermarket. It is a common areas of economic, social and cultural life between us. It should be developed in all its dimensions ...The single market brings a wider choice of products and services, lower prices, and better quality. It also implies protection through EU rules and workers’ rights, providing the stability that protects savings and investment, air quality ... It attracts foreign direct investment and it facilitates joint investment in our research, innovation and in our industrial capacity. It allows professionals like architects to offer their services anywhere in the EU ... And it should be permanently adapted to be more inclusive and to give access to the ersity of European cultures, with the development of a genuine digital market.In this period, when the EU has faced so many challenges, it becomes even more important to consolidate and to strengthen the single market. Our single market is the foundation of our unity.We cannot countenance a proposal where amnesties would be provided to terrorists. We owe a debt of gratitude to the bravery of the soldiers and police officers who upheld the rule of law and are accountable to it.The EU is prepared to change its Brexit position if Theresa May softens her negotiating red lines, Michel Barnier said today.The offer could be seen as an strategically placed olive branch coming just as the prime minister tries to fuse a deal between the warring sides of her cabinet in a showdown at Chequers. “I am ready to adapt our offer should the UK red lines change,” said Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said in a placatory speech in Brussels.“Our objective has always been to find an agreement with the UK, not against,” he said speaking to the Institute of International and European Affairs.He also called on all sides to stop warring over Ireland imploring everyone to “de-dramatise” the issue. But he warned that the EU would not shift its own red line on the single market, saying it should not be viewed “as a big supermarket” from which Britain can pick and choose. He said:The single market is our main economic public good. We will not damage it. We will not reverse what we achieved with the UK. We must find solutions that respect the integrity of the single market.This may douse any hopes that May could emerge from Chequers with a package that simultaneously units the cabinet and is acceptable to the EU which has always said access to the single market is conditional on the UK accepting freedom of movement of people. Hardline Brexiters were horrified to learn that she was preparing to soften her red lines by asking for access to the single market for goods and will see this as confirmation that the EU will not countenance a special compromise for Britain on immigration.However the conciliatory tone of Barnier’s speech was striking and may help edge negotiations to the next phase. On Northern Ireland he repackaged the need for a backstop solution spelling out the need for regulatory alignment on the island for live-stock and agri-food. This was necessary for food safety and animal health across the border and would allow farming to continue as it does, he said. He explained:Our own backstop solution would mean the limited set of EU rules would continue to apply in Ireland as it does today, which means there would be no need for checks at the border.In Germany pupils have been answering questions about Brexit in their exams. As my colleague Philip Oltermann reports, some of them have come up with a simple solution to the Irish border problem - a referendum on whether or not Northern Ireland should remain in the UK.That wouldn’t go down well with Arlene Foster ...Here are some more pictures from Chequers.This was the scene as a queue of ministerial cars lined up this morning.This is the room where the cabinet has been meeting.Barnier says in current circumstances it is becoming even more important to strengthen the single market. It is the foundation of EU unity, he says.And that’s it.

Then aged 23 with a three-year-old son, she had been forced to leave her two-up two-down house on the other side of the town centre when it was condemned as unsafe.Doherty is now 72 and she’s still there. “It was heaven coming here,” she says, sitting in her sunny front room. “It felt brilliant because we didn’t have a bath in the old house or an inside toilet. Everything here was perfectly decorated. It was so lovely.”There are housing estates like the one Doherty has called home for nearly half a century all over the country: the same pebble-dashed walls, paved paths and neat lawns. But somehow, over the years, Lower Falinge has come to represent something much more complicated.While locals insisted the figures were warped by the exclusion of parts of the estate with a higher number of owner-occupiers, and by the high level of hostel accommodation nearby, other media organisations jumped on the story. The following day the  published an article with the headline: “Rush-hour silence in a welfare ghetto”.From then on, as the area continued to top lists measuring levels of deprivation, the estate became a symbol of poverty, poor-quality housing and inequality. Photos started to crop up in all kinds of contexts, often in stories with no connection to Lower Falinge at all. In 2014, an article in the Independent with the headline: “England’s poorest will live nine years less than the richest, according to stark new ONS stats”, was illustrated with a picture of the estate. A 2015 New Statesman piece on myths about inequality was too. In 2016, the national media descended on Lower Falinge again, when David Cameron announced that “sink estates” could be demolished to make way for new homes. Although he did not mention it by name, journalists and photographers looking for an example of a “sink estate” outside of London once again arrived in droves, further establishing its status as a stock image of poverty.“Millions of ‘just managing’ families are on the edge of poverty – report warns”, reads a 2017 headline in the Express, accompanied by an image taken on an overcast day. The same image appears alongside the Sky News headline from the same year “‘Divisive’ white working-class label is ‘all talk’”. A list of landlord Tory MPs who voted against making properties “fit for human habitation” in the International Business Times and a piece in Prospect magazine about the benefits cap were similarly illustrated. Many  stories have featured images of Lower Falinge, too, including a recent story about the lack of funding for social housing in the north of England. But for many residents, these depictions do not fit with the image they have of where they live. “Every estate has its problems, no matter where you go, but they always seem to pick on us,” says Doherty. “We’re just normal people, wanting to get on with each other.”Andy Littlewood was chair of the Lower Falinge tenants and residents association when the media frenzy hit in 2016. “We’ve had to put in a lot of work to undo the harm that the press has done to us,” he says.The effect of the estate’s reputation on residents is wide-ranging, he says. Many will not tell potential employers where they live for fear it will put them off. “They just say they live in Rochdale because they’ve been turned down from jobs that they thought they had a good chance of getting when they’ve written Lower Falinge as their address.” Littlewood says the impact on younger people growing up on the estate is particularly potent. “The kids are fed up of being told they’re nothing,” he says. “If you tell a vulnerable person enough times that they’re scum, that they live on a sink estate and that they’re thick, eventually it’ll mess with their heads and they’ll start to believe it.”Littlewood does not dispute that many people on the estate are out of work – he is unable to work because of epilepsy – but is studying part-time for a degree in maths and computing from the Open University. The amount of employment and support allowance paid out per person on the estate is three times the average for the borough of Rochdale as a whole. And although Littlewood admits “it’s not perfect”, he says he loves Lower Falinge.Andrew Johnson, who lives in neighbouring College Bank – a group of tower blocks that can often be seen in the background of pictures of Lower Falinge – agrees. “It’s really handy,” he says. “I’m literally a two-minute walk from the town centre with supermarkets on my doorstep. It isn’t chaos, hopelessness and despair.”Marie Kelly, 37, is one of a small group of residents who spend their spare time tending to the estate’s community garden. On an implausibly hot day, she proudly gives a tour of the flower beds, which have produced, among other things, strawberries, purple sprouting broccoli, lettuce, carrots, beans, onions and potatoes. Kelly sees working on the garden as a kind of therapy. “I suffer with some mental health issues and it gives me something to focus on,” she says. For Clare Tostevin, the director of growth at Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH) – a tenant and employee co-owned mutual housing society that runs the estate – there is a wider problem with the way tenants of social housing are presented.“We need to think about how we change that narrative, because areas of social housing are full of people getting on with their lives just like all of us,” she says. “There’s this idea that if you’re in social housing you’re desperate, you’re needy, it’s your last resort, and that’s just not the case.”Although Tostevin is highly critical of the language used in Cameron’s sink estate announcement, the initiative provided RBH with £560,000 of funding to draw up regeneration plans for the estate. The proposals include the refurbishment of 10 blocks on Lower Falinge and the replacement of 15. Four in seven of the neighbouring College Bank tower blocks are in line for demolition, with new townhouses planned to replace them. Many residents are hostile to the move – upset they will lose their homes – a fact Tostevin says demonstrates that the estate is loved by those who live there.A new set of photographs have been taken now, this time on a sunny day, and they tell a different story. And even if the change is a wrench, it is welcomed by some. Doherty’s block is one of those earmarked for demolition. Although she will miss her home hugely, she is looking forward to moving into a more accessible ground-floor flat. “The estate has changed a lot over the years,” she says. “When we were young we would never throw rubbish on the floor or do anything like that, but there are still loads of lovely people here. “I’m not ashamed to say I come from here. I’ve never been ashamed to say I come from Lower Falinge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad9a0c1768123d58c0e8073474161f687bac68c/0_200_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f121dab1c3fc258fa7a1f985616c606","title":"chess magnus carlsen sets out schedule","story":"The world champion has carefully chosen which events to attend before his meeting with Fabiano Caruana in NovemberMagnus Carlsen is taking no chances. The 27-year-old Norwegian, who defends his world crown against Fabiano Caruana of the US in their 12-game, €1m series in London starting on 9 November, has set out his programme of pre-match tournaments which are as significant for what they omit as for what they include.Carlsen is the clear favourite to defeat his 25-year-old challenger, but at the back of his mind must be the memory of the close calls in his last two title defences against Vishy\u0026nbspAnand in 2014 and Sergey Karjakin in\u0026nbsp2016.The Indian failed to spot an elementary Carlsen blunder in game six which would have given Anand the lead going into the second half, while Karjakin missed a winning opportunity in game nine which would have put him 2-0 up with three to go.Carlsen’s next two events are both elite grandmaster tournaments, at Biel in Switzerland starting 22 July where his rivals include two GMs from the world top 10, and at the Sinquefield Cup in St Louis on 16-29 August, which will feature the final Carlsen v Caruana game before London. In mid-October, a month before the start of the match, he will warm up by leading Oslo at the European Club Cup in Porto Carras, Greece. He will miss the competitive and stressful 190-nation Olympiad at Batumi, Georgia, from September to October where Caruana will have the responsibility of first board for the US team as they seek to repeat their golden triumph of 2016.Earlier, Carlsen declined his invitation to the chess Grand Tour which is dominated by speed events. Caruana accepted but his decision proved catastrophic. The American had previously been in fine form, winning successive first prizes at Berlin, Karlsruhe and Stavanger, but the rapid and blitz at Brussels and Paris found him out. He shredded points profusely, and lost a total of 25 games at the two events.Carlsen has never been beaten in a tie-break, so the reality is that Caruana’s chances of winning the match will depend on the 12 classical games. It is logical for Carlsen to take meticulous care to hone his classical skills, especially for his six games with the black pieces.Seventy years ago when the Soviet Union’s Mikhail Botvinnik began his 15-year reign, world championship matches were of 24 games and the holder could keep his title either with a 12-12 result or, if losing, by winning a return series the following year. Botvinnik proved a specialist in both methods, and kept his crown into his 50s. The 12-game format is supposed to produce a contest with equal chances, but arguably Carlsen enjoys as great an initial advantage as Botvinnik due to his tie-break superiority.Good luck to the more than 250 competitors in the sixth annual DeMontford Bell Kings Place Festival to be staged today at the home of the . Play in five tournaments is from 10.30am to 6pm, and you can take a bye if you want to watch England v Sweden. The England Olympiad GMs Luke McShane and Matthew Sadler are top seeds in the Open.My first reaction to this game from the Russian Higher League was that the grisly fate of the black king at the end was probably initiated by the offbeat opening choice of 3…h6. But hold on, there are more than 50 database games with Harry’s modest push, The black players include GMs and IMs, and even two of my fellow chess journalists.Objectively, White’s counter 4 a3 is harmless, and later White sacs his d4 pawn for only moderate compensation. Black is well in the fight right up to move 17…Re8?? when he probably planned 18 c5 Bf8e7,seeing too late that White has 19 Nxf7! Kxf7 20 Qh5+ and it’s curtains. Hence the game finish, where the shivering black king is confronted by a mighty force and Moskalenko resigns without waiting to see whether White will meet 20…Kh8 by 21 Bxh6! or 21 Rf6! both of which lead to mate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10c80969fda9bc389b5a80ccdf972224c5e9348d/0_22_5298_3179/master/5298.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfbc7d7159217e0290fd08fa0eb5ff7c","title":"ufc 223 preview max holloway concussion","story":"It’s troubling when a fighter shows concussion-like symptoms, but particularly in the days before a bout rather than after itMax Holloway didn’t appear to be his usual cheery self during his appearance on the Fox Sports television program UFC Tonight on Wednesday. So Bisping, the former UFC middleweight champion, decided to press the issue.“Max, you say you feel great, don’t be offended when I say this, but you look like you just got out of bed,” Bisping noted. “Are you tired? What’s going on? How’s the weight cut? Are you drained? You look a little sleepy.”Holloway, 26, had already been forced to withdraw from a lightweight title fight with Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 223 in April after experiencing difficulty during his weight cut.If Holloway (19-3) was encountering similar trouble ahead of Saturday’s scheduled featherweight title defense against Brian Ortega at UFC 226 in Las Vegas, it’s a mere formality at this point. It turns out Bisping was onto something with his queries: Holloway wasn’t right. He withdrew from the fight on Wednesday citing lingering concussion symptoms, meaning he was, in effect, concussed when he was being interviewed.“Max’s team and UFC staff noticed Max was not normal since late last week,” Holloway’s manager, Brian Butler, said in a statement. “This became obvious to many watching his interviews and public appearances the past few days. He was showing concussion-like symptoms before he even started his weight cut and was rushed to the ER on Monday where they admitted him over night.“Initial scans seemed OK, and he was released Tuesday afternoon but symptoms still continued. Max fought with his team to continue with the fight. He showed some improvement over the next day but was still showing obvious symptoms. After open workouts, he crashed and was very hard to wake up, when he did he had flashing vision and slurred speech. He is now back in the ER for further tests.”Where Holloway goes from here is unclear. It’s alarming when any athlete experiences concussion-like symptoms, but particularly when it’s a fighter who is feeling the effects of his sport’s punishing nature days before a bout rather than after.Maybe Holloway’s isn’t a rare case but rather something that happens quite often with the warning signs ignored. Maybe it’s simply an indicator of progress that the public is even aware of Holloway’s plight. Retired two-ision champion boxer Timothy Bradley experienced a myriad of neurological issues in the aftermath of his 2013 fight of the year with Ruslan Provodnikov, and he was frank in discussing how he dealt with lingering symptoms.Bradley admitted that he was dizzy months later while preparing for a bout with Juan Manuel Marquez, and that his “speech was a little bit off.”The toll required to become – and remain – a top-level fighter reaches far beyond the physical punishment the athletes sustain on fight night.Sparring is often brutal, with recent studies showing that headgear does little to stave off the effects of blows to the head.And as Bradley illustrated, you never stop paying for some particularly grueling fights, even if the fighters appear fine to the naked eye.In this case, Holloway didn’t appear fine to the trained eye of Bisping, and fortunately, he was pulled off the card before he sustained possibly life-threatening damage.It’s a refreshing approach to Holloway’s health and safety in a blood sport where far too often the first call is to satisfy the machismo fans and media demand from the fighters.Retire on your stool after receiving too many blows? You’re branded a quitter. Having an off-night and simply losing, though not in any brutal fashion? Don’t give in, or your reputation will be shot to tatters.But in a day and age in when NFL players are retiring before they even reach the age of 25 citing health reasons, and awareness of the damages of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) is ever-growing, just maybe, Holloway’s removal from UFC 226 is a sign of progress, and not based around an outlier who simply has something very wrong with him.After all, these guys are routinely absorbing elbows, knees, punches and kicks to the cranium from well-trained athletes, and surely, Holloway isn’t the only combat sports athletes who has experienced such symptoms in the lead-up to a major fight.“The differential diagnosis could include … possible metabolic, toxic, inflammatory or even infectious causes if there had been no evidence of concussive or subconcussive blows,” Dr Margaret Goodman told the . She’s a Las Vegas-based neurologist who has examined thousands of fighters and is the former chief physician for the Nevada State Athletic Commission.Goodman also is the co-founder of the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association, the agency which oversees drug testing protocol for many of the biggest boxing matches, and she was the chair of the commission’s medical advisory board.She believes Holloway will undergo “extensive blood tests in addition to perhaps a Pet scan (positron emission tomography) depending on changes to his condition. Even if his condition resolves, it’s crucial to still determine the possible etiologies in order to protect him from recurrences or worsening – especially if related to prior concussions which can be additive.”So Holloway won’t compete Saturday, and his absence from the event’s co-main leaves the UFC with another gaping hole on a major card.As Thursday’s news conference wrapped up, light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier slipped off the stage and crashed onto a speaker before he limped away, and White surely couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Cormier is set to challenge heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic at UFC 226, and White could ill afford to lose one half of his main event, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec848039d6849225a8b0e0c37a9a5be73088672/90_89_4814_2888/master/4814.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da0680457339f88098dc1e0536199aad","title":"talking horses melting dew the best bet at a baking sandown park horse racing tips","story":"Rio Ronaldo was initially called the winner of the London Insurance Day Handicap and then minutes later the result was amended, calling Vibrant Chords the first homeThe sport of racing has been embarrassed at Sandown on Friday by the latest example of a photo-finish result being incorrectly decided, by a racecourse judge with a history of making such mistakes. Rio Ronaldo was initially called as the winner of the opening sprint but, after bookmakers had begun to pay out, an announcement was made to the effect that Vibrant Chords was actually the winner, following further scrutiny of the photo-finish print.The judge who blundered is Felix Wheeler, who made a similar mistake at Kempton in March that was not discovered for several days. That led to the introduction this week of a new system of double-checking results and the initial suggestion from officials is that the new system is the reason Wheeler’s latest error was caught within minutes, rather than at some point next week.It is believed that Wheeler was also the judge responsible for a similar mistake in December 2015, when The Blue Bomber was wrongly called the winner over Quarenta at Lingfield.Sandown is going to be baking for the fixtures the London track stages on Friday and Saturday. Temperatures are due to peak at 28C on both days and Andrew Cooper, the clerk of the course, says he has never known such a prolonged dry and hot spell since he started doing the job in 1990.“We had basically no rainfall in June,” he told me. “We’ve had months in the past when we might only have had 6mm or something like that. The last meaningful rain we saw was during Derby week.”Cooper and his team have been putting down 35mm of water every week just to keep the ground from getting any faster, which is an expensive business. He reports the going as good to firm, good in places on the sprint course and adds that he has been putting plenty of water on the tight bend out of the back straight to ensure runners can get some purchase.After the Eclipse crowds have left on Saturday, Cooper would really like to see some rain turning up in the forecast. “Crikey, you’d take anything,” he said. “Everything will benefit from it. We could do with a double-figure amount of rain at least.” But there is no immediate sign of same.Instinctively as a punter, I find myself looking for fast-ground horses with a turn of foot. You’d imagine that would be the only way to go after a month of such weather. But this morning on my Twitter timeline there’s a hard-working analyst suggesting the race-times at Newmarket last weekend equated to good to soft going, so it’s always worth having a look at the early races and the times they’re run in before taking a view.It so happens that my nap on Friday is still waiting for his first win on turf, having scored three times out of four on the all-weather. But I think fast turf is fine for Melting Dew (4.05), a progressive Sir Michael Stoute four-year-old who’s a 7-2 shot for the 10-furlong handicap.He was game at Chelmsford last time, his second run of the year, and it looks like the drop back to this trip has been helpful. He’s still on a winning mark if able to show his best form here, with Ryan Moore riding him for the first time this year.Earlier, a drop back in trip might also be good news for Barbill (1.50), a speedy Mick Channon juvenile who faded in the final furlong of the Coventry when last seen. He won easily despite a slow start over five furlongs at Bath on his debut and I hope to see some of that raw speed here. He’s overlooked at 8-1 in a small field.David Pipe has had a couple of recent winners and I’ll take a chance on his It’s Obvious (4.30) at Newton Abbot. He was fancied for a similar race there last month but fared poorly on his first run back from wind surgery. At 12-1, I’ll take a chance that he’ll be sharper this time, though it could be that the grey is going to need a slower surface."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b3b47ea36f25c06b2f147a80431e813af21e795/154_0_4513_2709/master/4513.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb11b5f1dca5f2e2d1cb20d5b901a08b","title":"england v india second twenty20 cricket international live","story":"The man of the first match, Kuldeep Yadav, is quite something. A left-arm wrist spinner who can turn it both ways, he makes a habit of bamboozling opposing teams. His T20i stats are unreal: in 11 games, he has 24 wickets, at an average of 11.79, and a strike rate of 9.8. So every ten balls, he takes a wicket. The only other bowler with 20 wickets to have a strike rate in single figures in T20i is Andre Botha (9.7), who played for Ireland for a couple of years from 2008 – and he was military medium, so not the stuff of nightmares. Will Kuldeep go past him today? India, understandably, stick with the XI that won the first game by a street. Kohli cheerfully admits that he would have opted to bowl here too. England are sufficiently rattled to abandon their spin-twin policy – although, to be fair, they usually lean towards seam at Sophia Gardens. Moeen’s absence, on top of Stokes’ and Woakes’, makes for more of a tail, so another top-order collapse will be doubly fatal. For Jake Ball, it’s a T20i debut. It will be interesting to see if Jonny Bairstow continues to languish at No 6.Kohli calls wrong, Eoin Morgan wants to chase, and England leave out Moeen Ali for Jake Ball.Evening everyone and welcome to the second T20 international. Is it me, or has the world turned upside down? There was a time when England might have had a nice friendly home series against India, only to get a rude shock when the Australians arrived, but the past month has been the exact opposite of that. Tim Paine’s Aussies were a pushover, beaten 6-0, whereas Virat Kohl’s India did better than that in the space of a couple of hours at Old Trafford. They were instantly assertive and aggressive, alarmingly good at both the basic skills and the dark arts. The England fans, had they not been drowned out by India’s support, could have been singing “Are you Scotland in disguise?” As it’s the best of three, England have to win in Cardiff tonight, which means not collapsing at the first whiff of mystery spin. India can afford to relax, but Kohli will surely see the chance to wrap up the series before many people have even noticed that it has begun.

To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/735b6baab21ebebb46514e92cb299d2f6e4348d0/0_37_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88944b2729ea80508fafac144ce4cb7d","title":"easy does it the slow travel guide to the peloponnese greece","story":"The majestic peninsula is home to local tavernas, picturesque villages, ancient sites and stunning stretches of coast. Best of all, it’s delightfully unhurried and free of overhyped hotspotsThe Peloponnese, southern Greece’s much-mythologised peninsula, has something of a reputation for philoxenia – the tradition of giving a warm welcome and showing generous hospitality to visitors. It’s also a region that embodies the very ideal of slow travel: local food and drink, plenty of walking, zero stress, tapping ancient rhythms and community spirit.Of course, this comes from the people. But it may also have to do with vital statistics. The peninsula is about the size of Wales, yet receives only a small percentage of tourists in comparison to the big beasts of Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Halkidiki and others. This means there’s no need to jostle among crowds.A topography of indented coasts, river valleys, steep mountain ranges and small coastal peninsulas encourages rural integrity over road-building. In hundreds of small villages, local ties are strong, there are festivals aplenty, and life revolves around farming and fishing, family and friends – and, naturally, local tavernas.Even the staples are sybaritic, from the famous Kalamata olives and green-gold oil to purple-hued tsakoniki aubergines to barrel-aged feta cheese. Wine grapes have been grown across the sun-baked slopes for centuries.For all its old-world charm, the Peloponnese is also a land of almost unlimited scope for exploration. It’s home to some of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, including Olympia and Ancient Messini, as well as many others lesser-known but no less enthralling. Much of Greece’s mythology originated here, including the main players of the Trojan wars.If you want relaxation, this unique part of Greece delivers in spades. Get the inside track on the must-visit villages, beaches and beauty spots, for the ultimate go-slow break in the Peloponnese ...Mani, the second finger at the southern tip of the Peloponnese and, by extension, mainland Greece itself, is one of the most beautiful regions in the country, with a mountainous spine running down to what were – until relatively recently – some very remote spots. The sun rises late on the coast because of the high Taygetos mountain range. Mornings tend to be lazy affairs where locals and visitors mingle to enjoy leisurely coffees and late breakfasts.It is also home to the pretty town of Kardamili. This laid-back little place is wonderful for walkers planning to hike the Viros gorge ditto for birdwatchers, artists and writers – little wonder that Patrick Leigh Fermor chose this village to be his home. The small beach resort of Stoupa is just a few miles to the south.Eat and drinkAll the local eateries are traditional family-run tavernas – as authentic a Greek culinary experience as you’ll find anywhere.  Kiki’s Taverna, up a side street from the town square, does dishes of the day rather than a set menu – favourites include sea bream and goat’s meat – ensuring produce is fresh and seasonal. It’s really traditional and popular with locals. If you want a stunning view with your meal, try Dioskouri Taverna, which overlooks the little harbour of Kardamili, for a fresh fish and sunset combination. It also sells local sea salt, olive soap and honey.StayThe Liakoto and Anniska hotels are on the sea front with the Taygetos range behind – Kardamili is blessed by both sea and mountain scenery. Anniska has a more traditional look and feel, with a stunning terrace where breakfast is served and drinks flow all day. Liakoto has sea-view rooms with private balconies overlooking the magnificent Messinian Bay. Both hotels have a very high number of repeat guests.This away-from-it-all haven is at the start of a string of fine, sandy beaches, culminating in the fantastic lagoon-like curve of Voidokilia in the heart of the nature reserve here – with wetlands excellent for birding. Close by is the historic town of Pylos, where the naval battle of Navarino was fought in 1827, during the Greek war of independence.Eat and drinkThere is an extensive choice of tavernas and cafes, which are really only busy at weekends and in peak season, when the locals from Pylos come for a swim and a fish lunch. Elia does superb salads, aromatic grilled sardines, and octopus with capers.StayZoe Resort’s 20 attractive studios and apartments have a large swimming pool and gardens leading down to the beach. Or you could opt to stay in the older – but no less charming – 24-room Zoe hotel.This historic town is known for the imposing walls of its Venetian fortress, which stretch out towards the sea. It’s very sleepy spot, with a wide sandy beach shelving very gently into shallow waters.Eat and drinkThe Klimataria restaurant is very well regarded, and eating out in the garden courtyard is a reason to visit in itself. Chicken in mustard sauce is delicious, as are the grilled veggies.StayThe Ulysses hotel, a small and friendly lodging with just nine rooms, is great for the beach. Breakfast is excellent and the hotel makes its own fresh lemonade – perfect for kicking off the morning. The Markopouloses, who own the Ulysses, are a mine of information and treat their guests as one of the family.The stunning, rugged hamlet of Gerolimenas, at the head of a fjord-like inlet, was once a busy trading post now it’s a nostalgic post-boom village, and comprises a mere handful of stone houses, a couple of tavernas and a beach.Eat and drinkThe fish – guaranteed fresh – is excellent here. Head for the harbour and you won’t go wrong.StayIf you want remote coupled with contemporary boutique-style comfort, a stay at the Kyrimai hotel should suit. Converted from a 19th-century warehouse, with sea to three sides, the hotel has a standout restaurant, and you can plunge directly from its jetty into the clearest of seas. Recommended for couples more than families, this is definitely one for romantic getaways.Find last-minute summer holiday deals at sunviloffers.

According to a group of German students who have sat the first school exam on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, the answer could be straightforward: give Northern Ireland a referendum on whether to stay in the UK or the EU.In April, students of English in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg were asked as part of their school-leaving exams to write about the differences between the hopes connected to Britain’s EU referendum and the reality of Brexit so far.Now that the Abitur – the certificate of general qualification for university entrance, equivalent to the UK’s A-levels – papers have been marked, some students have revealed some of the creative solutions they came up with.“If I understand it correctly, the conflict with the border is there because Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU,” said Daniel Boppert, 19, a student at the Lessing gymnasium in Karlsruhe, who scored 14 out of 15 points in the written English test.“Now they need a special solution. Perhaps they should have another referendum, but only for those in Northern Ireland, to see if they want to stay in the EU or in the UK under the new conditions after Brexit.”The dispute over the Irish border has proved one of the main sticking points of the Brexit negotiations. Any UK ergence from EU regulations – a key boon for many Brexit advocates – risks creating a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and unravelling the peace process.Boppert said that although he had some sympathy with the Brexit vote, “I don’t really understand it. I can see how the sovereignty idea has some appeal, but surely you can’t get around the fact that the economy will take a hit in the coming years. I don’t know if perhaps Boris Johnson had a special appeal, but it all sounds very naive to me.”His classmate Ole Ermel, 18, said it would be dangerous to revoke the referendum result and hold another UK-wide vote. “It would be absurd to simply void such an important democratic decision. Where would that lead to?” said Ermel, who scored 15 out of 15. “But perhaps they could have a vote only in Northern Ireland?”The exam, sat by about 31,000 students, asked for comment on a drawing by an Indian cartoonist, Paresh Nath, contrasting “Project Fantasy” – represented by a man in a bowler hat soaring to the sky on a UFO – with the realities of economic uncertainty and “job confusion”.“What I got from the cartoon was that the British people had a lot of hopes for Brexit, such as an upturn in the economy, and that these hopes haven’t really been fulfilled,” said Rebecca Gartner, 18. “Instead there has only been uncertainty.”David Blinov, 18, said: “I put that Brexit was a backward step for Europe. We have had 60 years of peace in Europe, and the EU has played an important role in that. Now the danger is that the EU as a whole could collapse.“I can see how people voted to leave because they felt patriotic, but I find patriotism pretty moronic,” he added. “If you happen to have been born in another country then you would have felt patriotic about that country. It’s so random.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d28faa13ebe504e3747c6688c90e1dfef48547/0_120_4297_2578/master/4297.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f013bd89a14d776b3f3ea00fb8eeaac6","title":"japan appetite eel same fate bluefin tuna","story":"Diners eat eel for an energy boost in summer, but its popularity has depleted stocksOversized inflatable plastic eels dangle from the ceiling of a supermarket in Tokyo as late afternoon shoppers inspect the real thing – beautifully packaged and prominently displayed – on the shelves below.In specialist restaurants run by generations of the same families, diners eat sweetened broiled eel, which is thought to take the edge off the heat and humidity of a Japanese summer.These annual rites are performed in honour of a dish that has been part of the culinary landscape for centuries. But Japan’s appetite for Anguilla japonica – Japanese freshwater eel – has come at a price.Eel stocks are a fraction of what they were in the 1960s, and conservationists say continued overconsumption could condemn the animal to the same fate as the Pacific bluefin tuna.The environment ministry designated the Japanese eel as an endangered species in 2013. The following year, the International Union of Conservation of Nature added it to its red list of threatened species, blaming overconsumption and environmental damage to the rivers and coastal areas where they spawn and grow.The plight of the eel has come into sharper focus as Japan prepares to mark the Day of the Ox in the lunar calendar – two days that this year fall on 20 July and 1 August – traditionally considered the hottest days of the year.Overfishing of juvenile glass eels, which are transferred to farm ponds where they are fed until they reach maturity, has led to record price rises, forcing restaurants to post notices apologising to customers for charging them significantly more each year for a simple kabayaki.The market price for adult eels rose to a record ¥5,300 (£36) a kg in March, about one and a half times higher than last year, according to the Union of Eel Farmers Cooperatives of Japan.The decline in stocks has been accelerated by illegal fishing, according to Kenzo Kaifu, a professor at Chuo University in Tokyo and an expert on eel conservation.The Day of the Ox, Kaifu said, “might be the perfect opportunity to think a little more deeply about the eel problem we’re facing, and make it a topic of conversation”.On those and other sweltering days throughout the midsummer, people are drawn to skewered fillets of eel that are dipped in a soy-based sweet sauce, cooked slowly over charcoal and served on rice.The dish, which is rich in vitamins, is eaten to provide a much-needed energy boost at the height of summer some believe the smoke from an eel cooking on the grill gives an immediate pick-me-up.Last month, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan agreed to leave the upper limit on catches of juvenile eels unchanged, to the dismay of conservation groups. China, which has the biggest single annual quota of 36 tons, much of which it exports to Japan, routinely shuns multinational efforts to restrict catches.Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora are expected to discuss the increasingly precarious future of the freshwater eel at a meeting next May.Some retailers are already taking action. The supermarket chain Aeon said it would stop procuring Japanese eels whose origin and journey through the supply chain was not properly documented. Instead it will switch to short-fin eels, a cheaper variety commonly found in Indonesia, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Some eel farmers are fattening their stocks so a single fish produces enough meat for two dishes, despite concerns that the bigger bones, which are usually barely perceptible, will put off some diners.Despite advances in farming methods, it is still not possible to raise eels from birth to maturity. Fisheries have to catch juvenile eels in the wild before transferring them to farm ponds.Campaigners are calling on consumers to resist the urge to eat Japanese eels this summer and throughout the year.“Even though there is a severe shortage, Japan, Taiwan, Korea have together decided not to reduce the catch quota next season,” said Kazue Komatsubara, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace Japan.“The fishery agency said there was no scientific evidence to support a reduction in catches. But Japan could reduce its catch quota by itself to help the eel population recover. It has to take responsibility as the biggest market for the Japanese eel.“The only way to avoid supporting illegal fishing and to be a responsible consumer who supports sustainable fishing is to stop buying eels.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3555748.1530826151!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may prepares to take decisive move on brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish sources expressed concern that Theresa  May’s anticipated move would be unacceptable to Brussels. Photograph: Sean GallupEPATheresa May has urged her cabinet to take “another step forward” towards a Brexit deal when they gather in Chequers today, as hardline backbenchers warned against remaining too closely aligned with the European Union. The Irish Government expects that Friday’s meeting, billed as decisive on the UK’s approach to leaving the EU, will see Ms May definitively signal a clear move towards a soft Brexit. However, sources in Dublin stress they will wait to see what happens in Chequers. Previous signals from London that Ms May was going to take on the hard Brexiteers in her Cabinet have only led to disappointment in Dublin. “Extreme caution on our side” was how one senior source described it.Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said a leaked proposal for regulatory alignment to be discussed at Chequers would turn Britain into a vassal state, as Downing Street denied that the plan would make a trade deal with the United States impossible.The Spectator reported on Thursday that a document circulated to ministers proposes that “the UK should maintain a common rulebook for all goods including agri-food” and would make “an up-front choice to commit by treaty to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on goods”. The document says that the deal “would not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal” as the UK would be unable to recognise the US’s “array of standards”.The prime minister’s official spokeswoman rejected as “categorically untrue” the suggestion that Britain would be unable to negotiate a trade deal with the US, whose president Donald Trump visits the country next week.On Thursday, Brexit secretary David Davis declined to deny reports that he had written to Ms May warning that her new customs proposal would be unacceptable to Brussels. The “facilitated customs arrangement” would see Britain leave the EU’s common external tariff arrangement. But all goods entering the UK would be tracked and charged the EU tariff if they are destined for Europe. Though officials in Dublin said they would wait for the outcome of today’s meeting, the Irish Government has been encouraged by meetings the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney held with a series of UK ministers in London on Wednesday. It was strongly signalled to Mr Coveney that Ms May realises there is no majority in Westminster for a no-deal Brexit, sources said. But Irish sources expressed concern that Ms May’s anticipated move would be unacceptable to Brussels, and interpreted the prime minister’s visit to Berlin on Thursday as an effort to ensure that the EU does not reject the British initiative out of hand.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that a suggestion by Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz that Brexit negotiations could be extended after next March’s deadline would “create more uncertainty”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

And the PM and the president will obviously have a chance to discuss trade next week,” the spokeswoman said. “What I can be very clear on is that it is categorically untrue to suggest that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US.”Brexit secretary David Davis declined on Thursday to deny reports that he had written to Ms May warning that her new customs proposal would be unacceptable to Brussels.

They were discharged in May and are at a secure location.Novichok was identified as the compound used in the attack by experts at the science and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down. Novichok is not a single toxin but a family of  so called fourth generation nerve agents developed by the Russians in the 1970s and 1980s. In some forms, it is reported to be between five and eight times more toxic than earlier nerve agents, such as VX. It can be stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients which, when mixed, react to produce the weaponised nerve agent. This makes it easier to transport and handle – an advantage for an assassin.Michelle Carlin, senior lecturer in forensic and analytical chemistry at Northumbria University, said that it can be used in the form of an ultra-fine powder as well as as a liquid or vapour. It kills after being ingested or absorbed through the skin.Is it the same batch that affected the Skripals?Dr Carlin said it would be unusual if the couple had been affected by nerve agent from the same source as that used against the Skripals four months ago.She said the new case was surprising and, while it is difficult to speculate over where the poison came from, it would be unexpected if it were from same source.It is difficult to speculate whether this is from the original source used in the Skripal case however, if it was from the same source, it is unusual that it has taken four months for someone to be affected by it, Dr Carlin said.Novichok in Salisbury: How could this happen four months after Skripal attack?What is the risk to the general public?Professor Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said the Skripal episode meant officials had a well-established response in place.She said: You do not need to seek advice from a health professional unless you are experiencing symptoms.She also urged not to pick up any unknown or already dangerous objects such as needles and syringes.What should I do if I visited these locations?You should clean clothing and items you had with you while you were there.Clothing that is dry-clean only should be put in two plastic bags (ie. a double layer), tied at the top and stored safely – PHE is reviewing the best way of cleaning these items and will publish information in due course.Items such as phones and handbags should be cleaned with baby wipes. Jewellery, watches and glasses should be washed with warm water and detergent and then rinsed in clean cold water.Should I destroy items of clothing?Public Health England says this is not necessary but if you want to do this put them in two plastic bags, tie them at the top and dispose of  it in an outdoor bin in the normal way.What effect does Novichok have on the body?Novichok, like all nerve agents, disrupts the chemical signals between the nerves and the muscles which control vital organs, said Dr Carlin.This can lead to breathing difficulties, loss of control of bodily functions, increased salivation, convulsions, paralysis.”Outward symptoms may include white eyes, convulsions, drooling and – in the worse cases – coma, respiratory failure and death.Nerve agents can act within minutes but they can also take hours to take effect. Much depends on the exact toxin, the dose and the delivery method. What is the treatment for those exposed to Novichok?Patients exposed to nerve agents are normally given the drug atropine, which reduces muscle spasms and the production of saliva. It needs to be given as soon after exposure as possible – ideally within minutes.It is likely that atropine was used to treat the Skripals, said Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds.Doctors may also use a drug called pralidoxime, an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals.Treatments for exposure to nerve agentsWhat are the long-term effects of exposure?Little is known about this, although exposure is thought to lead to long-term harm. One of the Russian scientists who helped develop Novichok, Andrei Zheleznyakov, was accidentally exposed and, according to a book about the history of chemical weapons, War of Nerves by Jonathan Tucker, he suffered permanent ill health including hepatitis, epilepsy, severe depression and an inability to concentrate.

With ticket stubs posted on social media sites by proud supporters, England fans wanting to travel to Russia need only copy down the ticket numbers and submit those, and can obtain a Fan ID in minutes.The ruse gets them into Russia visa free and allows them to buy match tickets on the black market.World Cup 2018 | Fixtures, groups, squads and moreThousands of extra fans are expected to head to Samara, 650 miles south east of Moscow, for the biggest England game since the semi-final against Germany at Italia 90.The game with Sweden is officially sold out but tickets are being advertised on the resale website Viagogo for up to £1,000. Fifa has lodged a criminal complaint in Switzerland against the ticketing agency.An analysis shows a huge spike in Google searches for ‘world cup tickets’ immediately after England’s win at 10.20pm on Tuesday and another spike at 7am yesterday when fans woke up. An astonishing 24.4 million people watched the match on ITV, the biggest televsion audience since the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.British Airways announced yesterday it was laying on larger aircraft on flights into Moscow and St Petersburg “to make sure as many fans as possible are able to travel”.One flight booking website said it had seen an 83 per cent increase in bookings to Russia in recent days although Kiwi declined to give actual numbers of people flying out. The biggest surge was in fans wanting to travel from Leeds to Russia - a three-fold rise in bookings - which may be linked to the fact that about a quarter of Gareth Southgate’s squad hails from Yorkshire.Russia World Cup in pictures: New puff July 3rdKevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporters’ Federation, said: “Getting the Fan ID is no longer the issue. Fans have posted their tickets on social media and that’s enough to use that to obtain the Fan ID. Supporters have discovered that the Fan ID and purchase of tickets is not linked by an database. They are not connected.“At the moment we are seeing a lot of chatter about getting to Samara. But fans are going to find it hard to get there in time. The price of flights from Moscow have soared as has the cost of accommodation.”England fans have, until now, steered clear of Russia, deterred by the fears of attacks by Russian hooligans and plunging diplomatic relations following the Kremlin-ordered nerve agent attack on the spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, Wiltshire, in March.Just England 2,000 fans watched the penalty shootout defeat in the Spartak stadium, outnumbered by at least ten-to-one by Colombians. Gareth Southgate, the England manager, has urged more fans to travel to cheer the team on and it is expected that at least 5,000 England fans will make the difficult journey to Samara.  About 10,000 supporters are anticipated to flood into Moscow if England reach the semi-final and the possible showdown with Russia.Fans already in Russia are now delaying their return home. Kieran O’Mara, 20, from east London, said after the Colombia win: “I wasn’t planning on going to Samara but more savings are being transferred and I’m going to stay on. I was saving up for a car but not now.”Hotels and homeowners have hiked prices in Samara, an industrial city unused to an influx of tourists. Even dingy flats were being advertised for rent at more than £1,000 a night.A two-bedroom flat on Sadovaya street near the downtown area was going for £1,378 on Saturday night despite its garish decor including bright pink floral wallpaper and a cheap sofa covered with a blanket. With no prior reviews on Booking, it appeared to have only recently come on the market.“Villa Chic” on offer outside the city centre was priced at 1,019 a night although it did include .what appeared to be a lapdancing pole in a party room with wall to wall mirrors, sauna and a karaoke machine.The cost of flights out of Samara and back to Moscow have also shot up with one budget airline charging £400 one-way for the one-hour 40 minute flight. Trains are an option but can take 18 hours, which means fans would have to leave Moscow on Friday to make kickoff in Samara the next day.Samara, Russia\u0027s sixth largest city, is an industrial hub of more than a million people located in a bend of the Volga River. The top tourist attraction is a bunker built 120 feet below the ground for Joseph Stalin as the Germans advanced in 1942.The city is known as the centre of the Russian space industry, since the Soyuz rocket, which remains the only way for astronauts to reach the International Space Station, is manufactured there.The British Government has banned ministers, senior officials and members of the Royal family from attending the World Cup following the Skripal poisoning but Labour has suggested shadow ministers could watch England if they wished.

I really find that bizarre. Well, that\u0027s one way of saying we don\u0027t care about you, isn\u0027t it?The Archbishop and his family also spoke about offers to pray for them, which often make disabled people uncomfortable. He has spoken in the past about his own periodical struggles with depression, which he described as the black dog.I\u0027ve had times when people have said, \u0027Could we pray for you?\u0027 And if I wasn\u0027t the Archbishop I\u0027d have actually said, \u0027I\u0027d really prefer that you didn\u0027t\u0027. But I feel that I can\u0027t always say that.He said he prays for Katharine but does not pray for Ellie, because he sees her disability as part of her. Katharine Welby also said she had been upset by one offer to pray for her addiction to negative thinking.I\u0027m not addicted to negative thinking, I\u0027m depressed and anxious medically, she said.Numbers to callIt\u0027s a chemical thing going on with me, it\u0027s not an addiction. And that was really unhelpful. I felt very unsettled by that.They\u0027re trying to be helpful, but they\u0027re not listening. And inclusion and welcome in Church is about so much more than accessibility physically.Research reveals high fees for booking flights over the phone – and Ryanair is the worst offenderFinancial adviser could face jail over £2m owed to ex-wifeWimbledon 2018: Rufus the Hawk has double the workload as pigeons hide in new £70m roofEngland fans rush to Russia after finding ticket \u0026#39loophole\u0026#39 Iran nuclear deal in doubt as world powers fall short on Tehran\u0026#39s demandsGirl, 10, youngest ever person to climb 15 mountains in under 24 hoursAlesha MacPhail: Teenager charged with rape and murder of girl, 6, on ButeTeenager charged with rape and murder of six-year-old Alesha MacPhailHarry Kane hails cancer patient, 5, as \u0026#39inspiration\u0026#39 and vows to beat Sweden for him on SaturdayTurkey arrests two Britons over Kurdish \u0026#39terror propaganda\u0026#39Farewell to tripe and eels as young find traditional British foods are not to their tasteNational Gallery fulfils \u0026#39long-held dream\u0026#39 to buy £3.6m first work by female artist in 27 yearsBin lorry gets stuck in road as heatwave melts surfaceHow popular is Donald Trump?

fulfils long held dream buy first work female","story":"digitalservices@telegraph Artemisia Gentileschi, Self Portrait Self Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandriadigitalservices@telegraphThe National Gallery has acquired its first work by a woman in nearly 30 years, as it pays £3.6million to help realise a “long-held dream” of redressing its lack of female artists.The self-portrait by Artemisia Gentileschi will become just the 21st painting by a female artist held in the gallery’s permanent collection, with women making up less than 1 per cent of its 2,300 works.The oil painting, acquired using funds from trusts and major donors and dated from 1615-17, depicts the artist as Saint Catherine of Alexandria in a rare and newly-discovered self-portrait which came to light at a French auction last year.Hannah Rothschild, who in 2015 became the first woman to chair the National Gallery Board of Trustees, said: “The acquisition of this great painting by Artemisia Gentileschi realises a long-held dream of increasing the National Gallery\u0027s collection of paintings by important women artists.“Gentileschi was a pioneer, a master storyteller, and one of the most progressive and expressive painters of the period.“One of a handful of women who was able to shatter the confines of her time, she overcame extreme personal difficulties to succeed in the art of painting.The National Gallery acquires its first painting by Artemisia Gentileschi“This picture will help us transform how we collect, exhibit and tell the story of women artists throughout history.”Gentileschi, a follower of Caravaggio, was the first female members of the Accademia del Disegno in Florence, with painting works for notable contemporaries including the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Charles I of England, and Philip IV of Spain.Born in 1593, she trained under her father, the painter Orazio Gentileschi, whose works are already in the National Gallery.In 1611, she was raped by Agostino Tassi, a collaborator of her father’s, with a subsequent seven-month court case seeing her humiliated and physically tortured as she testified.The National Gallery said: “Her biography has long overshadowed her artistic achievements, but she is now recognised as one of the most talented painters of her generation.”It will join 2,279 works by men in the National Gallery permanent collectionArtemisia Gentileschi’s paintings have often been interpreted as autobiographical, usually featuring strong female heroines, repeatedly based on her own image and utilised as a symbol of feminist empowerment.Self Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria includes a broken spiked wheel, which Catherine escaped before being beheaded and martyred.The painting, which had been lost to history, emerged at auction in Paris in December, sold to a dealer for an artist record of €2,360,600.Brought to the attention of the National Gallery, its new owner was tracked down by curators and a sale arranged for £3.6 million thanks to major donations from the American Friends of the National Gallery, the National Gallery Trust, Art Fund’s Sir Denis Mahon legacy, Lord and Lady Sassoon, Lady Getty, and Hannah Rothschild.Hannah Rothschild with Self Portrait as Saint Catherine of AlexandriaIt will be conserved before going on display early next year.The National Gallery currently has 20 works by women in its collection. The first was bought in 1878, Portrait of a Man by Catharina van Hemessen c1552, while the latest, a series of five works by Paula Rego, were presented in 1991.Gabriele Finaldi, National Gallery director, said: “The National Gallery’s remit covers Western European painting from around 1250 to 1900.“However, for a great deal of this period women were largely denied the same opportunities that were afforded to men and as a result only a handful were able to succeed in the art of painting.Dr Gabriele Finaldi, director of the National Gallery“Therefore, works by women artists of this period are very rare compared to works by male artists, and our collection reflects that historical fact.“However, although it is far more difficult for us to purchase great works by women artists, the National Gallery regularly works with women artists for its exhibitions and other programmes – most recently with Tacita Dean.“We have more exciting plans for the future that we will be announcing over the coming months.”Please review our commenting policyResearch reveals high fees for booking flights over the phone – and Ryanair is the

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

It was\u0026nbspvery orderly\u0026nbspand professional\u0026nbspbut there was a level of chaos to the amount of layers we had to achieve to really be able to put the Oasis on the screen. I had to go back and forth from the actors to the V Camp tent maybe seven or eight times a day, then to the editing room to see how this was all cutting in, and then outside to shoot the live-action portions of the film.

The whole or part of the backstop can be replaced by the agreement on the future relationship,” he said.“We must all de-dramatise this backstop. We will obviously need to clarify how and where these controls will be done but ultimately these are only technical controls on goods – no more, no less.”The timing of the speech appears to make it a direct appeal to the PM’s cabinet, who are likely to be following the negotiator’s words closely while they try and hash out a coherent policy at Ms May’s country retreat.The EU has effectively suggested Northern Ireland stay in the customs union and continue to follow single market regulations. This would prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland but would introduce customs and regulatory checks for goods on ferries between Northern Ireland and Great Britain – though no passport checks for people.We must all de-dramatise this backstop.This “backstop” would apply “unless and until” another solution was found to prevent a hard border: either a specific solution for Northern Ireland or an overarching trade deal between the UK and the EU that removed the need for checks.The UK has rejected the EU plan and says it wants to remove the need for a hard border with a trade deal or backstop that applies to the whole UK. Part of the opposition comes from the DUP, a Northern Irish unionist party on which Theresa May currently relies for a majority in the House of Commons.The EU has said there can be no Brexit deal without solving the Irish border question, and a no deal is expected to be an economic disaster for the UK.Speaking at the Institute of International and European Affairs think tank in Brussels Mr Barnier reeled off the benefits of single market membership, such as EU standards being emulated around the world, more leverage for trade deals, and seamless trade within the bloc.“In the Brexit negotiations there are still too many questions and too few answers,” he said, later adding: “We still have a long way to go and we do not have much time. The European Council in October is approaching rapidly. On the issue of Ireland and Northern Ireland we obviously need more clarity and most importantly certainty in the long run.”Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The UK would have to be in some form of customs union and single market to prevent border checks – which outside those institutions comprise both checks to make sure products are following regulations, and checks to make sure appropriate customs regulations have been followed.Soon after today’s Cabinet meeting the UK government is expected to publish its white paper laying out its policies – just three months before the deadline to end the negotiations in October.The UK reportedly wants to stay in the single market for goods only, but EU officials and member states worry that this give the UK an unfair advantage over member states and are expected to reject such a proposal if made.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of. A full-length Scandinavian mink coat.”RANDOM TV irritations: Jeremy Corbyn’s insanely annoying habit of giving a triumphant little sniff every time he thinks he’s made a good point.BBC presenters turning Aneurin Bevan into the L Ron Hubbard of their NHS cult. News ­reporters describing everything that’s happened quite a lot as being: “On an industrial scale.”Over-familiar BBC continuity announcers suddenly greeting me with a: “Hi, I’m Russell.” (Don’t care.) And a bite massage therapist from Hollywood called Doctor Dot failing to provide the necessary health and safety warning before she told This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes: “Ruth’s going to be biting you tonight.”’Cos she’d have bitten off more than she could chew if she did.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “Alphabetically, what day of the week comes first?” Andy: “Tuesday.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “In which decade of the 19th Century was the Crimean War fought?”Simon: “The 1950s.”Andrew O’Keefe: “TV series Twin Peaks is set in which fictional town?”Dan: “Transylvania.”“No, Twin Peaks.” NHS cultists gathered last week to applaud, grovel, sing, dance and grin like madmen in its honour.I exaggerate a bit, obviously. The singing and dancing doesn’t begin until tomorrow night on ITV.It was still an unsettling experience though, watching BBC2’s NHS At 70: Live, from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham, hosted by Anita Rani a level eight cultist from The One Show, Nick Robinson and Helen Skelton, who was in the maternity unit warning that we may “hear screaming”.As well as the massed ranks of staff, there were also NHS bigwigs and former patients who were encouraged to stand, clap and thank nurses, doctors, ambulancemen, chemists, the woman on reception, everyone.The nasty suspicion is, of course, that all this BBC worship, which makes Kim Jong-un’s birthday celebrations look really half-ar*ed, carries a political edge and is designed to shut down every single argument apart from the ones that say:A)The NHS needs more money. Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine. So instead of going to hospital when you crack your head open you will be prescribed tickets to go and see Russell Brand . . .”AAAAAAAAARRGH!The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “In 2017 which Hollywood star was made a dame at the age of 100?”Will: “Joan Collins.” Oof.King Kylian Mbappe taking the World Cup by the scruff of the neck with France’s thrilling 4-3 victory over Argentina.The Sky Planner’s damningly accurate verdict on Bear’s Mission With Warwick Davis: “Contains scenes of moderate peril.”Love Island narrator Iain Stirling breaking into a water fight discussion to announce: “God I’m lonely.” And the magnificent Laura going all Malcolm Tucker on Wes after he admitted he wanted to “crack on with Megan”.“Do me a favour then, f*** off.” Truly, hell hath no fury like a Scottish woman scorned.GOOD Morning Britain, Wednesday,  rent-a-gob Afua “problematic” Hirsch says: “I am English, but why do I feel uncomfortable ­answering that question?”Because if you ever stopped playing the professional victim and admitted this great liberal democracy had afforded you all the most ­extraordinary privileges in life, including an ­expensive private education, you’d swiftly have no point, purpose, job or income, obviously.ON Monday’s This Morning, the arrival of “Britain’s Sexiest Cow”, a Jersey milker called Char, prompted the obvious Schofield question: “What was the competition?”Two Friesians, an English Longhorn and Naomi Campbell, I’d imagine.THIS week’s winner is Simon Cowell and a Hawaiian feather god from the Royal Academy’s forthcoming Oceania exhibition, which you’ve probably booked already.Emailed in by Spud, of London.Picture research: Amy Reading.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they do.Remarkably, one in 20 British nurseries is banning superhero costumes because they believe these colourful outfits are making our children aggressive.This attempted taming of tots doesn’t stop there though.Four in five nurseries won’t allow any weapons — whether they are plastic pirate ­cutlasses or harmless pop guns.This is totally wrong.When I was with my mates on the school yard or messing about on building sites I ­pretended to be Superman or ­a soldier, replaying what I had seen in John Wayne war films.These games teach you vital lessons that you will carry on into later life, like I did with the military.There is kinship, holding your own and negotiating with the kid who is getting a bit rowdy.I learned right and wrong, how to ­interact with others and when I was ­stepping out of line.But it didn’t make me think: “I want to join the Army and kill everyone.” ­Everyone plays those games, and some become accountants.I certainly allowed my daughter to play “fighting” and there is no evidence such activities make people more violent.When kids get out their toy swords or bows there is laughter and joy.This is about the normal competitive urge. Whether it’s sport, watching The X Factor or wishing to be top in your class, there is a desire to win.It is wrong to pretend ­otherwise, because when these kids enter the real world of work they will face a very ­competitive atmosphere.If you don’t fight to get to the top, you will go under.We can’t all be soft and cuddly. ­Societies need people with different talents and attitudes.There is a clear antipathy towards the armed services as a career in these ­nursery bans.Britain is struggling to find new recruits at the moment, and the last thing we need is children growing up believing this is a bad choice.Being a soldier, sailor or part of the RAF are valid ­professions. We need these real-life superheroes.My daughter considered ­joining the Armed Forces. She looked into the idea of a ­military scholarship when she was 18.I was all for that, but in the end she decided upon ­something else.There is an idea that these games are just for boys, but girls want to be involved as well.Warfare is part of our genetic make up.It has been like this since the time of hunter-gatherers who had to defend their food sources — first their hunting grounds then later, when we became farmers, our lands.The reason we have been so successful as a species is the ability to defend ­ourselves.Back in medieval times kids would play with wooden swords and it was once ­obligatory for all males aged over 14 to practise the longbow on Sundays.We all go “ahhh” when we see puppies or kittens tussling and rolling about with their siblings, but what they are doing is learning to defend themselves.The idea that stopping any gameplay which involves ­fighting is going to change hundreds of thousands of years of human development is ­nonsensical.The complaint that toy weapons fuel a chaotic atmosphere in our nurseries is nothing more than a sign of laziness among the employers and employees.They are taking the easy route by simply banning lively games. This is more about making life easier for the staff than it is about helping our kids. They just want the ­children sitting there passively, possibly watching television or playing on a tablet.That is not what young ­children are about. They have a huge amount of energy to burn, and it is wrong to corral them into increasingly sedate life-styles.We have enough problems with obesity without demanding the next generation sit quietly all day long.The truth is that children will use up calories when they run around pretending to be in Star Wars or The Incredibles.The staff shouldn’t be bringing their own political ideas into the playground. They shouldn’t be making the children conform to what they think. Instead they should be focusing on ­fostering the imaginations of children by allowing them to explore these ideas.Steve Jobs, who helped to bring the iPhone and the iPad to the world, was inspired by Star Trek, and there were quite a few people getting zapped on that.By allowing children to play cops and robbers or pirates or cowboys or superheroes they are developing storytelling skills which will be vital in their ­education.Do we want them to come to read ­William Shakespeare with no prior ­knowledge of what conflict is?Any writer will tell you great storytelling needs drama and to have drama you need conflict.Going back as far as Greek literature there was greed, envy and jealousy underpinning the narrative. These nurseries fail to recognise the quality of the gameplay generated by young minds.They should be harnessing the roleplay and getting involved. The staff could ask why one person is always the baddie and what the kids enjoy about being the goodie.Superhero movies always contain a ­positive moral tale that children can learn from. There is good, there is evil, there is a recognition that someone has acted wrongly and they explore ways to improve our behaviour.When kids play cops and robbers, it is the police who win.The baddie always gets their comeuppance and the cops are the smarter ones.It’s not about arming our children with guns, it’s about arming them with the tools they need to be more creative.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was with a tall crew-mate. They were both drinking vodka straight out of the bottle and talking quite loudly.I left them there to go and watch Englands World Cup match at Le Grotte, a bar near the quayside. It is the one all the crews favour. I did not see Rebecca there, though it was quite crowded.I invited her and her colleague to join me and a member of my crew to the Jacuzzi on our sundeck. She said something about a great result for England, but wasnt making a lot of sense otherwise.She was still drinking vodka but could only manage three sips or so. I had to help her down from the sundeck when she left around midnight.Her colleague stayed behind. I got her off the boat OK, and helped her onto her own gangway. I could not go on with her because it was private.Rebecca was very unsteady on her feet. The last I saw of her was when she entered the doors to the ship. It is very sad.Earlier reports that she had left the boat to visit the local bar were incorrect, according to a crew member who said she watched the game aboard the Polonia.The Maltese-registered vessel had arrived at the Italian port last week and was undergoing a changeover ahead of a new arrival.Crew members raised the alarm in the morning when she failed to turn up for breakfast and found her lifeless in her cabin.Colonel Pier Enrico Burri, of the Imperia Carabinieri, yesterday told The Sun Online: The cause of death is still unknown but it seems as though she may have stumbled or slipped inside her cabin and hit her head or neck hard, breaking her vertebrae.She seems to have died between 12pm and 1am and her body was found about 8am. An Italian member of crew rang to alert us.The body was on the floor. The cabin was single, she slept there alone and very small as they are on boats. Her suitcases were on the floor as though she were rearranging things.She may have hit her head on the door of the cabin or while getting her suitcase down. These cabins are very constrained.He added: There was no blood and no traces of violence or other people. It seems as if no one else was on board when she died.The autopsy has to be done still but it looks like an accident.And Matteo Andracco, the lawyer representing the boats owners, said the boats chief engineer heard her alarm go off about 6.30am.After a few minutes when she didnt turn it off he went in and saw she was not moving, so they called an ambulance. In her room there were two levels, a lower level with the bed and an upper level with a small bathroom.It seems likely she fell down the five or six steps between the levels. So far nobody is under investigation. Police believe it was just an unlucky accident.Neighbours of Rebeccas, in Londons trendy Notting Hill, paid tribute to her, saying she was a genuinely nice person who always said hello.One, called Chris, said: She never caused any trouble here. She kept herself to herself, but always said hello to me and my kids.He added: Its genuinely shocking to hear, she was so young. Its always the nice ones it happens to.

with pro-Brexit junior ministers called in to meet the PM, in case they need to be suddenly promoted.But in a boost for the PM, its claimed Boris met David Cameron last night - and the former Prime Minister convinced him he has to back Mrs May.SALADSWheat, beetroot, squash and feta cheeseNew potato salad from the Chequers estateMixed salad leaves from the Chequers estateSummer tomato saladPUDDINGSScones with clotted cream and strawberry jam from the Chequers estateSticky tea loafFruit platterThe PM also won round Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a passionate Brexiteer, by holding one-on-one talks with him in Downing Street after his meeting with the other pro-Leave ministers.The other Brexiteers who are still on the fence include Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt, Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom.Mrs Mays de facto deputy David Lidington was sent out to bat for her this morning to persuade wavering ministers they should pledge support.He told the BBCs Today programme: What the PM is wanting to do today is to have a package of proposals that delivers on the referendum vote.We need to do that in a way that minimises the disruption to British jobs, British trade and investment in our country.The New Customs Partnership which would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU was rejected outright by Brexiteers in the Cabinet.And trade experts warned that the technology needed to make Max Fac - a solution which replaces border controls with electronic monitoring - work wont be ready in time for Brexit.The third way is designed to bring a compromise on customs between the two systems.Britain would scrap the blanket tariffs applied by the EU on most goods coming in from outside Europe, and instead set its own import duties.That is essential in letting the UK strike new trade deals with the rest of the world, with goods coming in tariff-free from countries such as the US.But to enable big companies to continue using supply chains which span the whole of Europe, Britain will continue to apply EU tariffs on around 4 per cent of products - classified as unfinished goods.And European tariffs will also be put on goods which pass through Britains ports on their way to the EU, but never enter the domestic economy.Another measure which would tie the UK closely to the EU is Mrs Mays proposal for full regulatory alignment for goods.That means Britain would copy European regulations on what products can be sold in shops.Its intended to ensure goods can still be imported and exported freely, while avoiding curbs on the services sector which makes up most of our economy.But it could prove controversial because it may hinder trade deals with countries who have different standards for their goods.But ex-minister David Jones warned: This is going to be less than the full Brexit that weve had repeated promises of from the Prime Minister.Nicky Morgan, the former Education Secretary turned pro-EU rebel, said any Cabinet ministers who cant get behind the PM should quit rather than sniping at her internally.She added: What we cannot see is a position that is briefed out tomorrow morning and over the next 48 hours Cabinet ministers begin to undermine and query it.Arriving at the summit today, Chief Whip Julian Smith - who is central to ensuring Mrs Mays plans can make it through the Commons - said he was ready and raring to go.And Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, revealed she was preparing for the marathon meeting by eating a breakfast of cold pizza.Mr Smiths deputy Chris Pincher last night asked Tory MPs to show public support for the Prime Minister by tweeting out a message of unity ahead of the Chequers talks.But Labour have mocked the summit - sending ministers a Cabinet survival kit including pyjamas, Red Bull, bags of fudge and even a draft resignation letter.INNER CIRCLETheresa May has hatched her Brexit customs plans with the help of a few key aides - and is relying on Cabinet loyalists to give it full-throated backing.Her de facto deputy David Lidington has been crucial to putting together the proposal, and was sent out to defend it on the airwaves this morning.And Chief Whip Julian Smith will be the key figure in forcing the plan through the Commons, against the opposition of Brexiteer MPs.Mrs May can expect to be backed by her closest allies such as Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and Transport Secretary David Lidington - even though they were on the opposite side of the 2016 referendum.HARDCORE BREXITEERSSeven Brexit-backing ministers have been meeting this week to co-ordinate their response to Mrs Mays proposals.They are led by Boris Johnson and David Davis - the two big beasts whove expressed the most public anger about the possibility of a soft Brexit.Michael Gove, whos been strikingly loyal to the PM so far, is also a member of the group who are threatening to quit over the plan.Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, International Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House, have also attended the Brexiteer crisis talks.But Trade Secretary Liam Fox has apparently been won over by Mrs May after a late-night chat in Downing Street.SWING VOTERSA key group of ministers - mostly Remain voters who now back Brexit - are thought to be on the fence about Mrs Mays customs compromise.Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson have both grown close to the Tory Brexiteers despite voting to stay in the EU two years ago.Treasury Secretary Liz Truss - who also has her eye on the leadership - is keen for Britain to embrace the opportunities of Brexit rather than just enacting damage control.And Natalie Evans, Leader of the House of Lords, is a wildcard as a Brexiteer whos previously been loyal to the PM but may now be running out of patience.PRAGMATIC LOYALISTSThe largest Cabinet grouping is made up of ministers who dont want to rock the boat - and just want to get Brexit over with so the Government can go back to the day job.The ultimate example is Jeremy Hunt, who voted Remain and now says hed change his mind, but is more focussed on boosting the NHS than the details of customs arrangements.Justice Secretary David Gauke, Education Secretary Damian Hinds, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock and Housing Secretary James Brokenshire - all promoted this year - are in the same category.And the Cabinets more junior members - Scotland Secretary David Mundell, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, Attorney General Jeremy Wright and Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes - are also seen as pragmatic figures who support a Brexit compromise.REMAIN ULTRASThere are just two senior ministers who are dedicated to forcing through the softest Brexit possible.Philip Hammond has become a hate figure among Brexiteers because of his obsession with avoiding short-term disruption to the economy.And Business Secretary Greg Clark is accused of teaming up with large firms to convince Theresa May she needs to stay aligned with European rules."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418519098.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"legoland discovery centre birmingham pensioner turned away","story":"Yvonne Radcliffe, 74, had travelled alone across Birmingham to visit the new £7m Legoland Discovery Centre, which had opened the day before.But the Lego-loving mums plans were shattered when a security guard told her that adults were barred unless they were with a child.The elderly pensioner was forced to walk nearly a mile back to Birmingham Snow Hill station, before getting a train back to her house.Yvonne, from Hall Green, Birmingham, said: “I couldn’t believe it.Adults make Lego, it’s wonderful. Yet I wasn’t allowed in because I didn’t have a kid with me. You couldn’t make it up really.“I think Lego is fascinating. I’ve watched documentaries on TV and saw it was opening in town.“I told my daughter I fancied a day out to see it, so I got on the train to Snow Hill and walked the rest of the way there.“Once I got there, I walked in and a girl stopped me and said I wasn’t allowed in. She said it’s the rules - I must be accompanied by a child.A spokesman for Legoland said: Legoland Discovery Centres are not theme parks but small, indoor attractions specifically conceived and designed from a child’s perspective to provide safe and fun environments for families with children aged 3-10 to enjoy together.“Many of the key features in the attraction therefore are not suitable or designed for the use of older children or grown adults of any ability - the soft play area, or some of the rides for example.“In order to constantly maintain a welcoming environment in which to play, the centres do not permit entry to any groups of adults, adult couples, or lone adults, regardless of race, gender or ability, who are not accompanied by a young child or children.We will be holding regular adult only evenings linked to every attraction in order to showcase specific attractions within the centre, such as Miniland and including additional events for adults."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000334742742.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"loch ness monster ness capture plan scotland","story":"Officials drew up a set of guidelines on how to protect the new species - including releasing it back into its watery home.The partly serious, partly fun code of practice was written in 2001 by Scottish Natural Heritage, which is funded by the Scottish government.SNH said it will dust off the plan and put it into action should the fabled beast be discovered, reports the BBC.It says officials should take a DNA sample from the monster so scientists can study the creature.Then it should be released back into the Loch with measures put in place to make sure it is not disturbed - as it would be an extremely rare species needing conservation.SNH, which promotes Scottish wildlife and natural habitats, said the 17-year-old code of practice remained relevant today.The organisations Nick Halfhide said: There was a lot of activity on the loch at the time about Nessie.So, partly serious and partly for a bit of fun, we drew up a contingency plan about how we would help Nessie if and when she was found.Some of the lessons we learned then have been relevant when we have reintroduced species like sea eagles, and were used when, a couple of years ago, four new species were found in the sea off the west coast.He added the plan would need to be updated when Nessie is discovered, and local communities and businesses on the shores of Loch Ness would be consulted.The discovery would lead to a boom in tourism to the Loch, which already attracts 400,000 visitors a year from around the world because of the legend.Tales of a monster go back nearly 1,500 years to when Irish missionary St Columba is said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD.More recently there have been numerous sightings and pictures - some of which turned out to be faked but others remain unexplained.The creatures appearance has been described as resembling a plesiosaur, an ancient sea monster that died out with the dinosaurs.Earlier this year an international team of scientists gathered environmental DNA from Loch Ness for analysis.The study will aim to confirm what species live there - including possibly any unknown animals that might be lurking in the 754ft depths.A road built alongside the 23-mile lake made it easier for people to visit and sightings of the monster soon followed.The most famous is the surgeons photograph taken by Dr Kenneth Wilson in 1934 and published in the Daily Mail.It fooled people for 40 years and ignited worldwide curiosity in the local myth.But in 1975 the image was exposed as a hoax, created with a wooden head and neck attached to a toy submarine.There have been more than 1,000 sightings since, and a host of documentaries attempting to explain the legend.One of the most convincing photographs showed a brown dinosaur-like hump arching out of the water in 2012.Local tour boat operator George Edwards later admitted he faked it for a bit of fun using a fibreglass prop from a 2011 National Geographic documentary.Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insisted the Loch Ness Monster exists in an interview with ITVs Good Morning Britain.Over the years various efforts have tried and failed to find the beast.In 1987 a £1million exploration called Operation Deepscan used a fleet of 24 boats which used sonar equipment to trawled 23-mile long lake.Nessie must have been hiding because the team came back with nothing.Steve Feltham is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records for the longest continuous Nessie-hunting vigil after moving to Loch Ness from Dorset 27 years ago.He has not seen it yet, but there are ten reported sighting a year on average.In November nine-year-old Sam Knight believed he snapped the monsters fin breaking the surface during a cruise with mum Jo.And last June Australian tourists Peter Jackson and Phillippa Wearne caught a serpentine object on camera while driving along the shore."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418164776.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john lewis bans shopper epilepsy every uk store","story":"Paul Chambers, 54, from Solihull, West Midlands, suffers from epilepsy and needed the goods to be visually perfect.Mr Chambers had spent £900 for the Samsung and Panasonic televisions he bought from the store over a three year period.But he recalls experiencing a number of problems with all of them, including ghosting, calibrating and pixelating.John Lewis told Mr Chambers they were ending their business relationship with him because they were unable to meet [his] service needs and could not meet [his] expectations, BirminghamLive reported.Mr Chambers said: Every time I have taken them back the staff have been very friendly so I was shocked to receive this letter.They have banned me from every John Lewis in the country and I cant buy anything off them online.The letter read: In light of your recent enquiries we now feel it necessary, and prudent, to terminate our business relationship with you.This decision applies to all John Lewis Department stores, JohnLewis and Waitrose.

many of them are already mulling their own strategies for how they could seize the top job, should she fall.In the corridors of Westminster plotting is already afoot, and many ministers and MPs have been going over what to do if the Prime Minister cant get the Government through the next crucial few months.Mrs May faces a tough fight to keep her Cabinet, backbenchers and European colleagues from tearing chunks out of each other.And theres every risk that her precarious position, with a slim majority in Parliament - could topple over.Last year furious Tories said she was just a caretaker Prime Minister after she lost their election, so who could be in the battle to replace her? The Foreign Secretary is still a firm favourite to take over from Mrs May if she quits or is forced out of No10.One of the main faces of the Brexit campaign and still popular with the public, Boris hasnt been shy on making big interventions on our EU exit in the last year.But he chickened out of voting against Heathrow last month by fleeing overseas - leading many to ask whether hes lost some of his bullish bravado. Since he took over from Amber Rudd following the Windrush debacle, Sajid Javid has been making his mark on the Home Office.The new Home Secretary - one of the great offices of state - could be one to keep an eye on. Leader of the backbench Brexiteers, Mr Rees-Moggs popularity among the public has somewhat worn off in recent months.But hes still in a hugely influential role as head of the European Research Group, and has respect among many of his fellow MPs.Hes also reportedly seeking out a PR firm - possibly to help convert his supporters into votes in a future leadership race.However, hes never held a ministerial job and jumping straight to becoming Prime Minister would be a pretty big leap - even for the Mogg, who says he doesnt want the job anyway. The man has made a pretty impressive comeback since stabbing Boris Johnson in the back after the EU referendum - by announcing he would abandon his mate and go for the leadership alone.Since being brought back into the Cabinet hes made headlines with a string of well-received environmental policies - from crackdowns on puppy farming to eco-friendly coffee cups.Dont underestimate what this Brexiteer is capable of. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has been making waves in recent weeks with her intervention in the tax debate.She made a bold speech saying the Tories shouldnt be just banning things and raising taxes in a way that is unConservative to try and compete with Jeremy Corbyns Labour.That followed a huge digital drive to get more followers on her Twitter and Instagram.Critics said she was making a naked bid for No10 - that would be quite something indeed. The Brexit Secretary has ruffled feathers by dropping hints he could quit his role over Mrs Mays strategy in recent weeks.After a bitter row about customs relations with Brussels, the ex-SAS fighter has been knuckling down and helping to deliver our EU exit strategy.This week he held crunch talks with the PM over her too soft Brexit plans, showing hes not afraid to stand up for what he wants, but would be be able to bring a warring cabinet together afterwards? Despite the endless flak that comes with being Health Secretary, Mr Hunt fought to cling on to his job during Mrs Mays last reshuffle, leading many to think that this man has a bit more steel that was first thought.And hes managed to win more cash for the NHS as the health service marks its 70th birthday this year.Despite his poor public image, this Remainer turned Brexiteer could be a key uniting candidate in any such leadership race.The Defence Secretary, though new to being a minister, is also being seen as positioning himself ahead of a possible leadership election.Hes been battling the Treasury very publicly for more money ever since he took over from Sir Michael Fallon at the end of last year.And he was even reported to have said he could bring down Mrs May in a bitter row over funding just last month.But his weedy comments telling Russia to shut up and go away may put people off the idea hes a strong enough leader to get Britain through Brexit.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Leavers say sticking too close to them would not represent the will expressed by voters in the 2016 referendum to \"take back control\", while Remainers argue going too far the other way would lead to chaos for businesses.The plans being considered by ministers could see the UK keep a \"common rule book\" with the EU for all goods, including agricultural and food products.It has also been claimed that Downing Street is prepared to concede that plans to align the UK with EU regulations in this respect would make a free trade deal with the US unlikely - something Number 10 later dismissed as \"categorically untrue\".   Speaking ahead of the summit, which will last well into Friday evening, Mrs May said the government had \"an opportunity and a duty\" to reach an agreement.\"We want a deal that allows us to deliver the benefits of Brexit - taking control of our borders, laws and money and by signing ambitious new trade deals with countries like the US, Australia and New Zealand,\" she said.\"This is about agreeing an approach that delivers decisively on the verdict of the British people - an approach that is in the best interests of the UK and the EU, and crucially, one that commands the support of the public and parliament.\" But the proposals revealed thus far have not gone down well with eurosceptic Tory MPs - and sparked speculation about whether there could be ministerial resignations.Lucy Allen said simply that \"this is not Brexit\", while Andrea Jenkyns said Brexit-backing MPs \"cannot support any deal that restricts our trade with other countries\".She warned \"from what we are hearing, (we are) prepared to vote against this\".One source said Leave-supporting backbenchers do not even think the PM\u0027s plans will end up being put to MPs because \"Boris and David aren\u0027t having it\". Brexiteers have received support from an unlikely quarter, with former deputy PM and staunch Remainer Nick Clegg tweeting: \"I hate to say this, but Brexiters would be right to reject PM\u0027s plan.\"Dual EU/UK tariffs would create vast red tape, smugglers would boom,Parliament would be humiliated. MPs would rubber stamp goods/agri rules from Brussels - right to refuse would never be used as costs too high.\"Better to put this costly, bureaucratic, unworkable proposal out of its misery ASAP. Whatever Brexit means, it can\u0027t be this.\" On the eve of the showdown, Brexit-backing ministers held their own private talks in Westminster.Mr Johnson, David Davis, Michael Gove, Esther McVey, Penny Mordaunt, Andrea Leadsom and Liam Fox met at the Foreign Office.Dr Fox, the international trade secretary, then spent 50 minutes at Number 10 with the PM.A Downing Street source said Dr Fox had been \"for a chat\" and dismissed speculation he might resign."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-ariana-grande-engaged_4334395.jpg?20180612175647 ","title":"i didnt find it funny ariana grande responds to fiances manchester bombing joke","story":"The 24-year-old comedian, best known for his sketches on Saturday Night Live, is alleged to have said that Grande must realise how famous she is because \"Britney Spears didn\u0027t have a terror attack at her concert\".Twenty-two people were killed by Salman Abedi after he detonated an explosive device in the foyer of Manchester Arena shortly after Grande\u0027s concert on 22 May last year.Davidson is understood to have made the joke during a stand-up routine several months after the attack.

Not well at all.Eurosceptic former cabinet minister Owen Paterson said the plans would represent a \"complete breach of Theresa May\u0027s manifesto commitment, reconfirmed to me at PMQs yesterday [Wednesday], to leave (the) single market, customs union and European Court of Justice\".He added: \"We would be out of Europe but still run by Europe.\"Lucy Allen said simply that \"this is not Brexit\", while Andrea Jenkyns said Brexit-backing MPs \"cannot support any deal that restricts our trade with other countries\".She warned \"from what we are hearing, (we are) prepared to vote against this\".One source said Leave-supporting backbenchers do not even think the PM\u0027s plans will end up being put to MPs because \"Boris and David aren\u0027t having it\". :: Will there be any resignations?It feels like we are reaching a tipping point.

Tory Leave-backers held dramatic crisis talks last night just hours before the Prime Minister summoned ministers to agree a \u0027softer\u0027 Brexit plan at a marathon 12-hour clash. Top Tories arrived at her 16th Century country retreat this morning in their sleek ministerial cars - and could be leaving after dark in a taxi. A No10 source warned the Prime Minister had already drawn up an emergency reshuffle plan if she\u0027s hit with mass resignations by Brexiteers - and those who quit must take a taxi the 40 miles back to London. Until then they are being locked in and surrendering their mobile phones to prevent leaks. The source told the Politico website: A select number of ego-driven, leadership-dominated Cabinet ministers need to support the PM in the best interests of the UK.  Or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation of MPs who will sweep them away. Tory Leaver Peter Bone offered to give a lift to fleets of resigning Brexiteers to save them the taxi fare. I will be on my way with my car, 4 seats available, guess another couple of cars will be required! he tweeted.   International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt was one of the earliest arrivals at Chequers for the all-day Cabinet session. Justice Secretary David Gauke and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling were both spotted being driven in. And Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss inexplicably had pizza for breakfast.   Young Remain voters held aloft a banner declaring your Brexit deal screws our future this morning outside the PM\u0027s Buckinghamshire bolthole. But furious Brexiteer Tories fear the 120-page plan will not be \u0027hard Brexit\u0027 enough.  They erupted into fury after it emerged the White Paper, which promises alignment with EU rules on goods, could make a trade deal with the US much harder. Theresa May\u0027s deputy David Lidington today denied a trade deal with the US would be impossible - and said the claims were pretty selective leaks of gobbets from Cabinet papers. But he did not deny they were accurate - saying only they were misquoted.  Instead he said: It’s like one of these theatre reviews that says this was not a brilliant performance and it goes up outside as \u0027brilliant\u0027. Mr Lidington said he was “confident the Cabinet will have a “concrete position that everyone will be able to sign up to” when the summit ends at 10pm. But seven top-level Brexiteers including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were spotted meeting last night in what is expected to be a bid to harden up the plans. Boris Johnson also reportedly met former Prime Minister David Cameron last night - with one source claiming the pair agreed Mrs May\u0027s deal was the worst of all worlds.

Theresa May has put off key decisions about whether to choose \u0027hard\u0027 or \u0027soft\u0027 Brexit, far or close links with the EU, for months due to Tory splits. Now she must make hard choices with just weeks of negotiation time left before the EU\u0027s October deadline. The key split is over how customs rules should work after Brexit. Mrs May had put forward two options - but both were rejected. Now she has put forward a third way, known as a Facilitated Customs Arrangement, that would let Britain set its own tariffs on goods in exchange for closely following EU standards. Brexiteer ex-minister David Jones said Theresa May\u0027s deal looked not very good at all.  He warned the red lines of leaving the customs union, single market and jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would be breached by what is being proposed today. But Remain-backing former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said ministers who don\u0027t fall in line should resign. If somebody said \u0027I just cannot live with this, this is not what I want\u0027 then yes, I think that they would have to think about their position, she told the BBC. Tory Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street urged ministers who refuse to get behind Theresa May’s Brexit strategy to “get off the bus”. Mrs May added: This is about agreeing an approach that delivers decisively on the verdict of the British people – an approach that is in the best interests of the UK and the EU, and crucially, one that commands the support of the public and Parliament. Labour issued a mocking \u0027Cabinet survival kit\u0027 with a can to kick down the road - and a packet of fudge for if Theresa May continues to fudge her options.  Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said: Tory infighting over Brexit has got so serious Labour has been left with little choice but to try and offer ministers a helping hand before this latest peace summit. “But there is a serious point to this. Every single day the Government wastes arguing with itself puts jobs and the economy at risk and increases the chances of the UK crashing out without a deal. No deal would be the worst possible outcome for our country. The EU has a \u0027customs union\u0027. This means the 28 states trade EU goods for free - and set an equal tariff on non-EU goods. For example, US car imports to the EU are taxed at 10%. Being in this customs union helps the UK, because the EU is our biggest trading partner and it prevents lorry checks at the border. Theresa May wants the UK to leave it because otherwise, Britain will have to follow EU rules and cannot strike trade deals around the world. But this creates a huge row with Brussels - and a headache of how to keep the border open between Northern Ireland (UK) and the Republic (EU). Britain was looking at two options: Customs partnership: Liked by Remainers, branded idiotic by Brexiteers. Britain would stick close to EU tariffs on imports and collect them on behalf of the EU. If the UK tariff is lower than the EU one, firms would be able to reclaim the difference. Maximum Facilitation - \u0027Max Fac\u0027: Liked by Brexiteers, but could cost firms \u0026pound20bn a year. Would keep the UK separate from Brussels rules. High-tech tracking devices would try to cut bureaucracy. E.g. Trusted” firms could pay tariffs at regular intervals, not every time they cross a border. Both options were rejected so now Tories are reportedly considering this \u0027third way\u0027: Facilitated Customs Arrangement: A compromise. The UK would leave blanket EU tariffs, allowing us to set our own import duties. But if goods are unfinished or destined to end up in the EU, Britain would still collect EU tariffs on Brussels\u0027 behalf. And crucially, the UK would keep many of the same rules - regulatory alignment - as the EU on standards of goods."},{"url":null,"title":"entire tory cabinet refuse meet","story":"NewsEvery single Tory Cabinet minister refuses to meet young campaigners who want to stop BrexitEXCLUSIVE: Anti-Brexit group Our Future Our Choice sent invitations to every member of the Cabinet - and got a clean sweep of rejections\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter17:14, 6 JUL 2018Updated17:19, 6 JUL 2018NewsThe anti-Brexit group Our Future Our Choice sent invitations to every Cabinet minister (Image: REUTERS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The Tory Cabinet has been accused of ignoring young people\u0027s fears over Brexit after every single minister rejected a request for a meeting.  The anti-Brexit group Our Future Our Choice sent invitations to every Cabinet minister except Theresa May herself. But they were either outright rejected, in most cases, or repeatedly ignored, in the rest, by every single one. In one case Brexiteer Liam Fox\u0027s staff admitted there\u0027d been a deafening silence when trying to fix a date adding: Dr Fox’s schedule is a nightmare. Activist Tessa Milligan, 20, from Hemel Hempstead, told the Mirror: To have flat out rejections or be completely ignored by the entire Cabinet is pretty demoralising. She added: Young people don\u0027t have the best links to government.  Since the referendum it feels like we have been completely written out of any debate about Brexit. The \u0027OFOC\u0027 group claims Brexit is a disaster and should be democratically stopped. It has close links to other well-funded \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 campaigns including Open Britain and Best For Britain. Not content with being ignored, OFOC staged a protest outside Theresa May\u0027s Chequers summit today. In an open letter to the PM, the group wrote: We can only infer from your Cabinet’s wholesale refusal to meet and discuss your Brexit deal with us that you and your colleagues know what we fear: your deal will deeply damage our future. The fact not a single open invitation was accepted sends a loud, clear message to young people across the UK that our thoughts about Brexit are not worth enough to be heard or acknowledged by your government.  While activists talked to police officers outside, inside ministers were furiously at work trying to thrash out a compromise Brexit plan. So close - yet so far. We\u0027ve seen the email replies from Cabinet ministers\u0027 offices giving their various excuses for not turning up. Here\u0027s what they said. What the activists were told  Alun Cairns NO REPLY Baroness Evans Unfortunately, the Lords Leader is unable to attend due to commiting already to another event at the same time. Boris Johnson The Foreign Secretary has considered your invitation and would have liked to accept regrettably he is unable to do so due to diary pressure. Brandon Lewis NO REPLY  Chris Grayling Unfortunately, as I am sure you will appreciate, Chris gets a large volume of speaking invitations and it is not possible for him to accept them all. Damian Hinds The Secretary of State was most pleased to be invited to OFOC. However, diary commitments mean that he is unable to at this time. David Davis NO REPLY David Gauke Many thanks for your kind invitation to meet. David regrets he cannot attend on this occasion. David Lidington  The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office, the Rt Hon David Lidington MP was very grateful for the Invitation to meet with Our Future Our Choice unfortunately due to his current diary commitments and travel schedule, he will be unable to meet with Our Future Our Choice presidents.   David Mundell Rt Hon David Mundell MP has asked me to thank you for the invitation. Unfortunately Mr Mundell is unable to attend due to ministerial and constituency diary commitments. Esther McVey Unfortunately, given the pressure on the diary, both in the constituency and the Department, Esther doesn’t feel able to commit to speaking at the event. She would not like to commit and then have to let you down nearer the event. Gavin Williamson  Thank you for your email to speak to Our Future Our Choice. Unfortunately, due to a ministerial commitments, the Secretary of State, Gavin Williamson , is unable to attend.  Greg Clark The Secretary of State was grateful for your request, but is fortunate enough to receive a great number of meeting and invitation requests, so regrettably, he cannot accept as many as he would like. James Brokenshire James Brokenshire has asked me to thank you for your invitation. However, he regrets that due to extensive commitments he is unable to accept. Jeremy Hunt Regrettably due to pressure on his diary, Jeremy is unable to accept your kind invitation on this occasion.  Karen Bradley Karen has asked me to thank you for the email but I am afraid she is not able to accept the invitation at the moment. Liam Fox I have sent half a dozen emails to [ANONYMOUS AIDE] since you first contacted. There has been a deafening silence. Dr Fox’s schedule is a nightmare. We have no Fridays available as the only ones there are have to be allocated to the constituency. Most Saturdays if he is in the UK, he is already booked up to speak around the country. I don’t really think he is a good proposition for you at all. Matt Hancock He would love to be able to help, but sadly he does not think that this will be possible. Matt’s diary is heavily committed over the coming months, so I am afraid that he is unable to accept. He appreciates you thinking of him though and hopes that the event is a great success.

So here’s your guide to flouncing so you can be ahead of the game. Choosing the PM’s Buckinghamshire country retreat instead of No10 was a masterstroke by the PM. Flouncing out of No10 is a simple business. You tell Mrs May you’re quitting, bowl out of the famous black door, and within seconds you’re in the London streets.  Chequers is 40 miles away from the capital, and potential flouncers have been told they won’t be allowed to use their ministerial cars to take them there if they resign. Legging it is not much of an option either. Chequers has a long drive, a very long one. It is not designed for flouncing.  You will get to the end of it drenched in sweat and feeling thoroughly humiliated. And then, still dripping away, you must wait for a taxi.  But if you have forgotten to take a card for the local Aston’s Taxis cab firm, helpfully placed on the Chequers sideboard for such eventualities, you must walk all the way back up the drive again to get one. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is now off the PM’s flouncing list, as was Environment Secretary Michael Gove last night and then back on it this morning. You can never tell with the Gover as he is adept at changing sides at the last minute.

He\u0027s coming home, he\u0027s coming home, he\u0027s coming, Boris is coming home, hums Boris Johnson under his breath, while WhatsApping his co-conspirators about threatening mass resignations and forcing the Prime Minister to do his bidding. Theresa, meanwhile, is in the drawing room with a length of lead pipe and wondering how many times she\u0027d have to headbutt it to end this hell. For two years now the Conservative Party has been healing Brexit division in the country by demonstrating the same sort of unity you get from putting an atom bomb in a mincer. A huge burst of energy and noise, followed by proto-particles pinging around randomly and leaving behind a toxic goo that\u0027d still make you gag 4.5billion years later.  Despite the fact the Tories haven\u0027t been able to reconcile their stance on Europe for 44 years, some bright spark set a deadline for them to have a Brexit plan by next March. And so as the clock ticks down and the ruling party is fed slowly into the metal teeth of time, they wriggle and writhe in a desperate bid to ensure that on the other side of the grinder lies a land of milk and honey. It\u0027s a bit like watching people invent their own idea of heaven while having their limbs sliced off an inch at a time. Life without fingernails is fine, elbows are ungodly, ONLY THE DEVIL NEEDS SHOULDERS!   In normal political times, the thought of a Prime Minister needing to hold a summit and cut a deal with their own Cabinet would be evidence of an imminent general election. In Year 0002 Anno Brexitus, it\u0027s just another Friday. Albeit one of a finite, and diminishing, number of Fridays available for this sort of economy-shattering farting about. For days and weeks now more than half a dozen of the Cabinet have been having secret 8am meetings in Boris Johnson\u0027s office, and coincidentally over the same period have come a series of leaks about ministers who hate the PM\u0027s plans, ministers who want the PM\u0027s job, and a number of excuses about why pro-Brexit groups breaking electoral law to get a Brexit vote does not, in any way, mean Brexit is undemocratic. It\u0027s still the democratic will of the people, it seems, even if the people\u0027s democracy was broken first. And now here they come. Boris, Gove, Davis - men who all tried and failed to be Prime Minister, and are now trying to be the men in charge of the Prime Minister. And there\u0027s the Prime Minister. A woman given the impossible task of keeping egotists happy, while having no means to achieve it.  Are we all here? Has Boris turned up or is he on a convenient foreign trip in order to avoid reality, again? Ah, there you are behind me. Sit where I can see you please, and hand that ivory-handled dagger to 007. Mr Bond, please guard the door and see that Laura Kuenssberg can\u0027t get in. Right, everyone, thank you for coming to this meeting of St Theresa\u0027s church fete committee, I mean Brexit war summit, whoops wrong paperwork! That\u0027s tomorrow. I hope you all left your mobiles in reception as requested and that the cable ties attaching you to the chairs are not chafing too badly, but you see it\u0027s pretty clear I can\u0027t trust any of you c***s not to leak like that vomiting girl in The Exorcist so these are the lengths to which you have driven me. Now, the problem before us is this. The people have voted to Leave the EU and if we do that they\u0027ll lose their jobs, be foraging out of skips and actively go out looking for Novichok-laced fag butts in order to end their hell, for which we will be blamed. Every business big and small will be utterly f***ed if we impose border controls so we have to come to a customs and trading deal with the EU which allows things to continue much as they are now, and if we do that the editor of the Daily Mail and quite a few of the people tied to that sofa will says it\u0027s not Brexit and bring down our government. F** BUSINESS!  I don\u0027t doubt you\u0027ve tried, Boris, but you\u0027re not helping. Added to this there is a broad agreement we must control immigration, for which we need a hard border at all our ports of entry, and if we have a hard border in Northern Ireland we can wave goodbye to Northern Ireland. If that happens, it will also not be Brexit because it will in fact be \u0027ohf***sh*t\u0027, or at least that\u0027s what the Queen said when she explained how it feels to be racked in the Tower. So here we are. We cannot f** business, but the people have told us to do something that will. If we obey the will of the people, they\u0027ll blame us rather than themselves. If we try to muddle along much as we are now but without any MEPs we will be shot of Nigel at last, but on the other hand Jacob Rees-Mogg will tell everybody we\u0027re EU serfs while moving his investment fund to Ireland. In short, we must find a way of saying it is Brexit without actually doing Brexit, or the country is screwed and so are we. Yes, David Davis. You may speak. It\u0027s going wrong! It\u0027s going wrong! It\u0027s going! Brexit\u0027s going wrong!  Pray tell, David, what were you expecting? Unicorns! Money! Sailing the high seas of international trade like buccaneering privateers of yore! Yes well sadly if you don\u0027t meet the EU rules you can\u0027t trade with the EU and if we don\u0027t do that we\u0027re screwed. You can pin all your hopes on Liam Fox selling secondhand bassoons to Tonga if you like , but it won\u0027t replace a market of 500m people, 45% of all our exports and 55% of all our imports which include, but are not limited to, cancer medicines, cars and fuel. America! America! Yes Liam, America is an option. It will take many years of arguing with a fascist nincompoop who wants to put America first in order to get a deal, and in the meantime you will have been tossed onto the That Was A Stupid Thing To Say scrapheap. Easiest trade deal in history, my arse. It\u0027s coming home, it\u0027s coming home, it\u0027s coming, trade is coming home! The whole point of trade is that it leaves home, Liam. Whyever did I give you that job?  Now see here. If you don\u0027t all agree with me that the country\u0027s future is more important than yours I have an emergency reshuffle plan to replace you all with people better able to act as a team, deal with high-pressure situations and not talk to journalists unless they\u0027re told to. GUFFAW! What crapitudinous traitors could you find prepared to sell Blighty down the river into servitude to Johnny Foreigner, what-what? Well, Boris, you\u0027d be replaced by Harry Kane. I\u0027d tell Rashford to drill the back of the trade deal net, let Pickford save the NHS and bring on Eric Dier to sub Davis and save the day at the 11th hour. And, in extremis, I\u0027d resign and let Gareth Southgate move in to No10. Wot! Replaced by the son of an Irishman! A Portugeezer negotiating with Brussels! And all of them working class oiks!

Tom Enders\u0027 warning came as EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier complained there were still too few answers - despite offering Britain an olive branch.  The twin interventions were made while the Tory Cabinet were holed up in a 12-hour summit at Chequers to thrash out the UK\u0027s Brexit plan. Mr Enders, chief executive of the European plane giant, said: The sun is shining brightly on the UK, the English team is progressing towards the final, the RAF is preparing to celebrate its centenary. And Her Majesty\u0027s Government still has no clue, no consensus on how to execute Brexit without severe harm.   Airbus, which has 14,000 UK staff, triggered a backlash in the Tory party last month after threatening to pull out of the country in a no deal Brexit.  Mr Enders said today: Rest assured we are taking first preparations as we speak in order to be able to mitigate consequences from whatever Brexit scenario may follow. Make no mistake - Brexit, in whatever form, soft or hard, light or clean or whatever you call it, will be damaging for the industry, for our industry, for other industries and damaging for the UK whatever the outcome will be. Meanwhile the EU today told Britain there were still too many unanswered questions over Brexit.  Brussels\u0027 chief negotiator Michel Barnier said: In the Brexit negotiations, there are still too many questions and too few answers. But he also stretched out an olive branch to Britain - as long as Theresa May gives some ground.  Mr Barnier said: As the European Council has made clear, we are ready - I am ready - to adapt our offer should the UK\u0027s red lines change. Time is short. We need to quickly have realistic and workable solutions and obviously we look forward to the UK\u0027s White Paper. The UK\u0027s proposals will facilitate both the UK\u0027s internal political debate and negotiation with us. Our objective has always been to find an agreement with the UK, not against the UK.

One aide to the Prime Minister warned ‘blood on the carpet is no bad thing’ as she faces the threat of a mass resignation. It\u0027s an apt phrase - because Chequers wouldn\u0027t be out of place in a murder mystery. Ministers have been told that their phones will be confiscated on arrival at the luxurious Buckinghamshire retreat to avoid leaks. And between wood-panelled walls and sumptous grounds, talks are expected to last late into the night.  The PM’s country retreat has played host to many important talks in the past, including last year when Mrs May met with senior aides and pollsters to discuss the pros and cons of calling the snap election that resulted in her losing her majority. But what is Chequers and why is it being used for these crucial talks? Here’s everything you need to know…  Chequers is a luxurious country house found just outside of Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire, about 41 miles from 10 Downing Street. One theory is it is named after the chequer trees that grow on the estate. It’s not the biggest of stately homes, with just 10 bedrooms (Buckingham Palace has 240) but it has vast swathes of land - around 1,500 acres are at the owner’s disposal. It also features a huge art collection, with 190 pieces dating from the early sixteenth century to a 1937 piece by none other than Winston Churchill.  It was built in its present form in 1565 by the High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, William Hawtrey, though historians say there has been a manor house on the site since the Roman era. The house has been connected to many important events and personalities in British history. One of its owners was a grandson of the puritanical Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell. Why does Theresa May get to stay there?  Chequers has been at the disposal of the Prime Minister of the day since it was gifted to the nation by its then-owners Lord and Lady Lee in 1917. The Chequers Act of 1917, which was given Royal Assent on 20 December 1917, established the house as the country residence of the Prime Minister. In the past, most PMs were landed aristocrats who already had country retreats, but for those with lesser means like Lloyd George it was necessary to have an estate to host foreign dignitaries and the like.  Interestingly, this was the first Act of Parliament to even acknowledge the existence of a Prime Minister, even though the title had been used unofficially for over a century. Since Lloyd George first stayed there in 1921, Chequers has been used by PMs for crunch summits and meetings like today’s - but also for family Chrsitmases and simply relaxing weekends amid the stresses of office. What famous events have taken place there?

Known as Panama disease, the fungal infection has already spread throughout Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Central America. But if the infection reaches South America the Cavendish banana – the species most commonly sold and consumed worldwide – could face extinction. Cavendish bananas are genetically identical to one another, which allows Panama disease to rapidly decimate entire harvest yields. Some five billion Cavendish bananas are eaten each year in the UK alone.  But salvation for banana crops could come in the form of a rare Madagascan tree, which grows an unpalatable, wild species of banana that is immune to Panama disease. Plant biologists are rushing to create a hybrid of the two species of banana in the hope of creating a infection-resistant strain. But there are only five Madagascan banana trees in existence. The disease does not affect the fruit itself, but rapidly kills Cavendish banana plants.

Joyce Ross had settled down to eat her dinner when she heard someone entering her ground floor flat through the front door.  Her suspicions were immediately aroused, so the brave OAP armed herself with the back scratcher and urged the scruffy stranger to get out, Chronicle Live reports .  But in an ordeal lasting around 20 minutes, the burglar barged past the 73-year-old and refused to leave her flat despite Joyce repeatedly asking him what he wanted and shouted at him to get out. The pensioner stood her ground and eventually sent him packing when she picked up the back scratcher she keeps to deal with annoying itches, and chased him with it.  Detectives are still hunting the man, who snatched Joyce’s handbag before he fled. And the courageous victim has told why she had to stand up to the invader. She said: “I stayed in control and I just wanted to get him out. I don’t think it has sunk in yet, but I do think I was quite brave now. “I stood up to him because he came into my house. He had no right to just walk into my home like that. He pushed his luck and I think I shocked him by standing up to him. The shock and the anger just kicked in.” Joyce, of Byker, Newcastle, was sitting on her sofa watching television when the man crept in at around 6.15pm on Monday.  She had earlier closed the blinds on her front window to stop the glare from the early-evening sun hitting her screen. When Joyce first heard her front door open she assumed it was a member of her family letting themselves in. But she went to investigate after calling out and getting no answer. And as she reached the doorway she was confronted by a tall stranger who was standing in her hall mumbling to himself. “I could tell that he was really out of it,” said Joyce. “He never spoke, he just mumbled to himself. “I said: ‘Get out, get out. Just tell us what you want but get out’. My defence was just shouting and I was waving my arms, but he seemed oblivious to it. He didn’t say a thing, then he moved forward.”  The man then pushed Joyce against the door frame as he walked into her lounge. “He was just standing there mumbling,” she continued. “He wasn’t saying anything or doing anything so I just didn’t know what he wanted. If he had asked for a packet of tabs I would have given them to him just to get him out.” Joyce picked up the blunt table knife that had been on the tray next to her tea, but the intruder knocked it out her hand. She reached for her phone and tried to dial 999, but again he took the handset off her.  Determined Joyce then spotted the back scratcher her granddaughter had bought home as a present from a holiday in Benidorm, which she always keeps near her sofa. “It wasn’t really to use as a weapon, it was just a threat,” she said. The man quickly grabbed something from the coffee table and ran out the front door and fled down the street. It wasn’t until Joyce returned to the living room that she realised her bag, containing two purses and a mobile phone, had gone. Joyce then called the police.  She was treated at her home by paramedics for a small cut to her head sustained in the struggle. And detectives are now appealing for help from the public to identify the man, while praising Joyce for her bravery. Det Sgt Tony Scott, of Northumbria Police, said: “The man responsible is most likely an opportunist thief so people would have seen him on Denmark Street before this incident. “He has entered the house through an unlocked door and been able to make off with Ms Ross’ purse but I am sure he wasn’t anticipating the reception he received. “Ms Ross showed great courage to stand up to the man and force him from her home. We are making sure she is safe and supported but I want to praise her for her actions.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bride refuses screen world cup","story":"NewsBride REFUSES to screen World Cup quarter-final match - so guests say they\u0027re not comingThe woman has also banned guests from checking their phones and says her big day is a \u0027football-free zone\u0027\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByElaine McCahill12:40, 6 JUL 2018Updated13:15, 6 JUL 2018NewsThe woman has also banned wedding guests from checking their phones (Image: EyeEm)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA bride-to-be has refused to screen England\u0027s World Cup quarter-final match against Sweden at her wedding - and some of her guests are not happy.

In response, some of the guests have threatened not to attend due to her attitude.  The woman reportedly posted on Facebook that she had had received multiple requests from guests wanting to know if the football will be shown.

She has it a status on saying she has had multiple requests from guests wanting to know if the football will be shown.

Also, we are doing well, we haven\u0027t been in this situation where we may actually have a good chance of WINNING!!!! for years and probably never will again. The whole country is routing for them. Even people who don\u0027t like football are into it. I just don\u0027t think it\u0027s fair to expect people not to watch it, or not even check their phones! But she added that she understood the bride-to-be\u0027s frustrations and, as she\u0027d got married herself recently, she knew the stress of planning.  Other Mumsnet users agreed the match should be shown. FootballsComingHome said: I would show it, everyone\u0027s going to be checking phones otherwise, my dad was at a wedding in 66 and they showed the match at the reception until it went to extra time, then the bride put a stop to it so they all went to the pub instead. ReservoirDogs added: What kind of numpty gets married when the World Cup is on without checking when fixtures are (the fixtures have been out for ages even if you don\u0027t know which slot England would fit in to)? Even if you are not a fan yourself you know that the majority of people are and will want to see it. But others sympathised with the bride-to-be.

SEAT have published new information on driving in extreme temperatures - claiming that intense heat is almost like driving with a blood-alcohol reading.  According to SEAT, common air-con mistakes – including immediately turning the system on full-blast – could be reducing its effectiveness, resulting in higher interior temperatures and possible dehydration. \u0026Aacutengel Su\u0026aacuterez, an engineer at the SEAT Technical Centre, said: “Open the doors and lower the windows for a minute before turning on the air conditioning to naturally lower the temperature in the interior.”  If rear passengers say they can’t feel the cool air, then the nozzles could be set incorrectly. “It isn’t a matter of temperature, but in which direction the air is flowing inside the car. “The nozzles should be pointing upwards, not towards peoples’ faces. Then the air flows all around the interior of the car and reaches every passenger consistently.” A difference of just 10C – 35C compared to 25C – inside the car can diminish reaction times by 20% – the equivalent to a blood alcohol reading of 0.05% matching the Scottish limit and close to the maximum of 0.08% for the rest of the UK.   UK weather: Trains hotter INSIDE than it is outside as commuters face heatwave misery  With outside temperatures recently soaring above 30C in the UK, hurried commuters and holiday-makers in particular could be at risk of dehydration. Cars parked in the sun can reach 60C. To help reduce cabin temperatures before setting off and while on the move, the Spanish car manufacturer – based in sunny Barcelona – has published the most common air conditioning mistakes that drivers make:  Turning on the air conditioning full blast as soon as you get in the car  When entering a hot car, it’s tempting to turn the air-con on to maximum. However, turning on the air conditioning straight away without opening the windows will just recirculate the hot air.  Instead, open the doors, lower the windows for a minute or two before shutting the doors and cranking up the A/C.  Keeping the air recirculation option activated  Keeping it on can make the windows fog and reduce visibility. Most cars will have an ‘Auto’ option, which can regulate itself to prevent fog while keeping drivers and passengers cool.  Not turning on the air conditioning in the morning  Some summer mornings can be cool, but it’s still a good idea to keep the A/C on to prevent windows from fogging up when the outside temperature rises.  Pointing the air jets toward you  It’s tempting, but it’s counter-productive and stops the car getting an even distribution of airflow.

Kayla Hanna, 20, told the guards she needed the fizzy drink to maintain her blood sugar levels for her diabetes.  She even showed the employees her tattoos on her wrist that indicated her condition and her insulin pack, Belfast Live today reports.   But the overzealous workers took the Lucozade off Kayla at the Red Hot Chilli Peppers gig in Balmoral, Belfast.   Then aged 18, it left the music student very anxious and upset during the show as she feared she\u0027d become seriously ill.  But now Kayla, of Belfast, has been awarded \u0026pound2,000 after a judge ruled Eventsec, which employed the staff, was in breach of the Disability Discrimination Act.  Kayla had the support of The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, which felt Eventsec should have been able to make simple adjustments to meet the woman\u0027s medical needs. Kayla, who has Type 1 diabetes, said: I carry Lucozade with me at all times as it gives me the glucose I need if my blood sugar levels go down.  When the security guard told me I couldn’t bring the bottle in I told her of my condition and showed her the tattoos on my wrist which indicate I have diabetes. She said that, \u0027anyone could have that\u0027 so I also showed her my insulin pack and the meter used to check my levels. She consulted with another guard and they insisted that they had a strict policy and they would not allow me to bring the drink inside. She added: I was very anxious and upset throughout the concert. I stood away from the area near the stage where my friends were because I was afraid something would happen to me and I would not have the Lucozade.  This had never happened me at other concerts I went to. I really hope that, now this issue has been brought to light, it won\u0027t happen again to me or other people who live with diabetes. Mary Kitson, senior legal officer of Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, said: These are the kind of circumstances in which the reasonable adjustment provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act can be most beneficial. They are in the Act to ensure that people with disabilities are not denied access to services by reason of general policies which can, in themselves, be otherwise justifiable and necessary. In this case, the company should have made arrangements to ensure that Kayla could have accessed Lucozade during the concert if needed, for example by directing her to its own medical centre at the venue and providing her with a bottle of Lucozade. That would have been a simple adjustment and would have met her medical needs. The court has ruled that this was a breach of the law and awarded Kayla \u0026pound2,000.” But Eventsec says it is disappointed with the court\u0027s decision.

Rescuers were met with conditions so vile they were forced to wear respiratory equipment when entering the room in Cardiff, Wales. The animals were living amid piled-up filth in the bedroom, which was full of cobwebs, straw, debris and rusty furniture. It took RSPCA staff a day to clear the room. A small number of the guinea pigs died, with the others remaining in the charity\u0027s care.  Barbara Herbert, from Cardiff, has now admitted causing 29 guinea pigs to unnecessarily suffer at Cardiff Magistrates’ Court.

But as nice as it is to have stolen the Australian summer, us Brits just aren\u0027t used to coping with sudden rises in temperature. Still, all it really takes is a bit of preparation. Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

Linda Martin watched with pride as her daughter Maryanne Pilling, now 46, married the love of her life, Tommy Pilling, 60, in July 1995.  The couple tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony at a church in Shoeburyness, Essex, with Maryanne dressed in a Cinderella-style gown. And almost a quarter of a century on, they remain happily married, sharing kisses and cuddles and making amazing memories every day. Maryanne, who lives with Tommy in Southend-on-Sea, tells her husband she loves him three times a day and lights up when she speaks of him.  As well as sharing tender embraces and cooking dinner together, the couple also go out to concerts, play football and laugh with loved ones. Their love has defied both the odds and critics - who have previously called Linda a \u0027bad mother\u0027 for allowing Maryanne to get married. Some have even deemed the couple\u0027s relationship disgusting. But as far as Linda is concerned, the fact her daughter has found somebody to love is the best thing she could have ever wished for.

She spoke out about her inspirational daughter and son-in-law on Jo Piazza\u0027s Committed podcast ahead of their wedding anniversary.   She also told the host: I can always remember saying I don\u0027t care what she [Maryanne] achieves, I just hope to God she finds somebody to love. And she did, she has. And to me, that\u0027s the best thing I could have ever wished for her. Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s fairytale relationship began 28 years ago. The couple, who share a passion for cooking, met through fate in 1990 while working in a local training centre for people with disabilities. At the time, Maryanne was 19 - 13 years younger than Tommy. But from the moment they met, they shared an incredible connection. When asked what she thought of her first encounter with her future husband, Maryanne told Jo: That I love him. Just true love. It wasn\u0027t long after that Maryanne brought Tommy home to meet her family. She giggled happily as she proudly introduced him.  That\u0027s when I realised my little girl was falling in love, said Linda. Although Tommy was fairly quiet, Maryanne soon brought him out of his shell. And a year after they met, things became very serious. Deciding he wished to propose to his beloved girlfriend, a besotted Tommy bought a plastic ring for her from a vending machine. He then gave it to Maryanne, who was elated. She excitedly showed her mum the ring, saying Tommy wants us to get engaged. Linda, who admitted her first thought was good God, sat down with her daughter and Tommy and asked them what they wanted. Tommy said I want to marry Maryanne and Maryanne obviously said the same, she said in the podcast, named \u0027Love Me Tender\u0027. I said \u0027right well we better do something about this officially then\u0027.  She took the couple to get a proper ring and for the next four years, they remained engaged, getting to know each other properly. And in mid-July 1995, they tied the knot in a perfect\u0027 ceremony, surrounded by hundreds of family and friends, and so much love. Linda said her daughter looked stunning in her white dress, tiara and long veil, while Tommy donned a made-to-measure suit. For their honeymoon, the couple stayed in a seafront hotel. Afterwards, Tommy moved into Maryanne’s family home. However, amid the post-wedding bliss, Linda received cruel messages telling her that she shouldn\u0027t have allowed her daughter to get married. But she told Jo: For me as a mother, I would have felt I\u0027d failed her if I hadn\u0027t acknowledged the fact that she was in love with somebody.  Maryanne and Tommy later moved into their own flat. Today, they continue to live independently there, next door to both of their mums and across the road from Maryanne\u0027s sister, Lindi. And despite needing assistance from their loved ones with most aspects of their life, including cooking and washing, they manage superbly. They go out on dates and day trips and, recently, Tommy celebrated his 60th birthday with a huge party. As always, his wife was by his side. Pictures of the happy pair - who were thought to be the first couple with Down\u0027s syndrome to wed in 1995 - are regularly posted online.  A Facebook page, set up by Lindi, follows Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s romance and has amassed more than 40,000 followers.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will also have a moment for reflection at the Famine Memorial, before visiting EPIC, the Irish Emigration Museum, which tells the story of the 10 million Irish people who have emigrated across the world. The Famine memorial was built to remember the Great Famine in Ireland during the mid 19th century. About a million people died and a further one million emigrated from Ireland, dropping the population from about 20 to 25 percent.  Meghan and Harry will also learn more about the “bright future of Ireland”, the statement said, with a visit to DogPatch Labs, a shared work space for technology start-ups.

Julie Shann, 55, says that she was told she had terminal lung cancer with “very little” time left to live.  But the diagnosis turned out to be incorrect.  As Julie began planning for her own funeral, she sold her family heirlooms and precious antiques to pay for the costs, reports the Hull Daily Mail .  A month later and experts in Hull Royal Infirmary told her she had never had the devastating disease, and her doctor was not qualified to give her the diagnosis.  For a month I was made to think that I was dying and had to plan my own funeral - it was absolutely heartbreaking said Julie. I tried to stay strong for my children who were supporting me but also grieving, and gave them a brave face, but behind closed doors I cried and cried. I cried myself to sleep at night and every time I went to bed, I didn\u0027t know if I would be waking up again the next morning. It was so horrible to think that every day could have been my last day. Julie said she had been giving the devastating diagnosis when she visited her GP in January 2015, just two months after suffering a stroke. She says she then began to sell off her possessions, believing she was going to die, including her grandmother\u0027s wedding ring and eternity ring, as well as treasured antiques and gold jewellery that would ordinarily be passed down to her children. I had to sell off nearly all my prized possessions to pay for my funeral as I didn\u0027t have the money for it and didn\u0027t want to leave my family with the burden,” she said. “I had to sell my nana\u0027s wedding ring and eternity ring, all my gold and antiques that I had, all of which were meant to be passed down to my kids.” "},{"url":null,"title":"primary school headmaster bans football","story":"NewsPrimary school headmaster BANS football because children as young as four keep \u0027doing a Neymar\u0027Parents at Home Farm School, Colchester, Essex, are shocked by headteacher Richard Potter\u0027s new rule - but he insists the pupils were \u0027taking the game too seriously\u0027\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLouie Smith15:15, 6 JUL 2018NewsParents have labelled the ban at Home Farm School not normal or healthy (Image: SWNS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA primary school has banned football for one week after pupils began copying the \u0027cheating\u0027 antics of World Cup stars. Headteacher Richard Potter scrapped breaktime matches after spotting children diving, arguing with each other, and taking the game \u0027too seriously\u0027. The youngsters had been copying the theatrical antics of players including Brazil star Neymar. Mr Potter, who insists he is not anti-football, says the ban will be lifted once children have written a new code of conduct.  He said: “These are four to 11-year-olds who are trying to emulate the older players - this was causing a lot of arguments. “I am not anti-football at all. This is a learning opportunity to build on their sportsmanship.” One parent at the school said: The World Cup should be an event that encourages more young people to get playing football, not less. “The fact our headteacher has chosen to ban kids from playing football, I feel, is quite shocking.  “There must be another method he can use to discourage children from aggressive behaviour. Parents at Home Farm School, Colchester, Essex, were informed about the change in an e-mail sent out on Wednesday. Headteacher Potter says he he wants to encourage students playing fairly with morals and sportsmanship. During the week ban children will write their own football rules with the help of teachers. Child psychologist Emma Kenny has criticised the move.  She said: Banning kids from football is like tying their arms up. Children are resilient and enjoy having competition as well as - they are just mimicking the professionals. It is part of the world and it is in our DNA. It is a great thing.

The Most Reverend Justin Welby, who also christened Princess Charlotte, will preside over the service in London next Monday. Little Louis, the third child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, will be christened in the Chapel Royal in St James\u0027 Palace. It is the same chapel where his big brother Prince George was christened in 2013. But the Archbishop couldn\u0027t resist making a joke ahead of the big day.  Speaking to BBC Ouch, he said: You know, if you\u0027re at the wedding don\u0027t drop the rings and if you\u0027re at the baptism don\u0027t drop the baby. He added of the Cambridges: They\u0027re a wonderful family, there\u0027s lots of love and it\u0027ll be a great occasion. Prince William and Kate Middleton have kept quiet on who they are going to name as godparents for their youngest child. But bookies are backing close confidants, like the couple\u0027s outgoing private secretaries Miguel Head and Rebecca Priestley, rather than family members. Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: It\u0027s looking increasingly likely the Duke and Duchess will turn to trusted aides over family members.

But in contrast to uncle Prince Harry\u0027s wedding to Meghan Markle in May - where stars like David Beckham and George Clooney got an invite - this is set to be a cosier family affair.  But that\u0027s not to say there won\u0027t be some big names in attendance.  All of the most senior royals are expected to be at the Chapel Royal at St James\u0027s Palace for the event.  As well as Louis\u0027 parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, his siblings Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 3, will also be there.  Royal grandad Prince Charles will also be at the service, along with his wife the Duchess of Cornwall. Louis\u0027 great-grandmother the Queen is expected to attend, despite pulling out of an event last week due to illness.  Her Majesty missed a service at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral marking the 200th anniversary of the Order of St Michael and St George because she was feeling under the weather.   It\u0027s not known if Prince Philip will attend the event. The Duke of Edinburgh, who turned 97 last month, retired from public engagements in 2017. He has only made rare appearances since, and underwent hip surgery in April.  But he was up and about for Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding in May, and was seen last month attending a polo match with The Queen .  As for the Duchess\u0027 side of the family, we can expect to see her parents Michael and Carole Middleton, along with her brother James. Her pregnant sister Pippa should also be there, with her banker husband James Matthews.   As for Louis\u0027 godparents, the Cambridges have not yet announced who they\u0027ve asked to take on the roles.  The bookies\u0027 favourite to be one of the godfathers is Prince William\u0027s outgoing private secretary Miguel Head, while his former nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke is tipped to be a godmother. Whoever is picked, there\u0027s likely to be few of them. Royals favour having a lot of godparents - William has six, George has seven, and Charlotte has five.  Will Harry and Meghan be at the christening? One of the big talking points of Princess Charlotte\u0027s christening is that her uncle Harry wasn\u0027t there. The Prince admitted he was a \u0027bad uncle\u0027 after missing the service in 2015 because he was away on a planned charity trip to Africa.  Simson Uri-Khob, who runs Save The Rhino, told the Mail on Sunday th royal told one of his companions: What a bad uncle I am! I should really be there. But today I am here, this is where I want to be. Luckily, this time he is in London, so it would be very surprising if he and Meghan missed the ceremony.

While we have quite a few details already, from the font being used to the gown, we don\u0027t know if Kate will be snapping her own photos. What we do know is we can expect official photos of the Cambridge family - all four of them - after the event. Prince Louis is set to be christened on July 9 at The Chapel Royal, St James\u0027 Palace in London. Before Prince George, the last royal baby to be christened at St James\u0027 was Princess Beatrice, in 1988. When can we expect the official photos? Previously official photos were shared days after the big day by the palace showing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the new godparents and the Queen with Prince Phillip. Princess Charlotte\u0027s photos were released on the Thursday after the service. Other photos showed the family leaving the church and the couple with their children.  Who will take the official christening photos? Mario Testino is a Peruvian fashion and portrait photographer. He was featured in magazine such as V and Vanity Fair. He took Princess Charlotte\u0027s snaps for her christening, but he\u0027s recently been dropped by Vogue and was left off the official photographer list for the Royal Wedding after it emerged he was being sued by a male model for sexual harassment.  13 male models and assistants went on record with the Times to say he subjected them to inappropriate sexual advances going back to the mid-90s. We are yet to hear who would replace him and take the photos for Prince Louis\u0027 christening. Will Kate take photos of Prince Louis\u0027 christening? Kate is good with a camera too, so it\u0027s not too far fetched. She has released her own photos before via Kensington Palace.  What we know about the service We have a full guide to Prince Louis\u0027 christening. Prince Louis is expected to get the same treatment, with Harry and Meghan also attending, though neither are expected to be named as godparents. Tradition is to ask a close friend rather than family to take on the role. The little Prince will be christened at the same venue as his brother George, though Charlotte was christened at Sandringham Chapel.  Louis\u0027 godparents are yet to be named - though it\u0027s expected it will be revealed on the day - but that hasn\u0027t stopped the speculation. Bookies have William\u0027s former private secretary Miguel Head and childhood nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke as favourites. There\u0027s likely to be more than two though, as Prince George has seven and Charlotte has five.

Dylan Williams, 6, baffled doctors who initially thought the swelling on the right side of his face was caused by either mumps, a tooth abscess or an allergy. But the horrifying truth was that the youngster had one of the world\u0027s rarest cancers which had enveloped his body. Mum, Siobhan O\u0027Flynn, told Mirror: “A couple more days and he would have died. Tumours were pushing out his eye, wrapping around his brain, spine, shoulder blades, ribs and kidneys. “No one could believe that he’d survived - he was riddled with tumours, even his central nervous system was infiltrated. I am forever grateful to the NHS for catching it when they did. ”  Siobhan, 44, said that a swollen cheek had been the only physical sign that her \u0027healthy, robust little boy\u0027 could be so gravely ill. “He had just started year one and I noticed a swollen cheek. My wonderful GP was abroad so I took him to the locum doctor several times and we were told that he might have mumps but I just knew that was not it. Then we took him to the dentist a couple of times thinking it might be a mouth abscess. One night he woke up in pain after his lips suddenly swelled up. We rushed him to A\u0026ampE and they gave him steroids and anti-histamine and the swelling went down so they thought it was an allergy.  But his cheek was still swollen and when his brilliant GP got back she immediately referred us to the dental clinic in hospital where he had an X-Ray and ultrasound.”     And the first X-Ray revealed this enormous mass in his head. The consultant kept us very calm and called a colleague to examine the scans. Then they took ultrasound images of Dylan\u0027s head and it was very quiet in the room as they looked at them. I knew something was wrong but I assumed it was just an abscess. They asked to speak to me alone, sat me down and said \u0027we\u0027re greatly concerned.\u0027 But I wasn\u0027t grasping the gravity of the situation so they said, \u0027Siobhan, what\u0027s the worst thing you can imagine?\u0027 Then I knew and I just collapsed. It was pure shock. But you go straight into doing things so you don\u0027t really have time to process it too much.  He was riddled with cancer but there had been no indication. He had seemed like a healthy, robust little boy. He was eating, going to school. A swollen cheek was the only physical indication. He was admitted to hospital the same day and had biopsies, CT scans, MRIs, X-Rays and blood tests. In his first MRI one of his eyes looked bigger than the other because the tumour was pushing it out.     I had to call his big brother Ruairi to break the news and all I could hear was sobbing on the other end of the phone as I tried to reassure him that we were doing all we could to help Dylan and he was in the best place possible to receive care. With childhood cancer there\u0027s no known reason or cause. Some children are born with it. No one really understands why. Five days later, on Christmas Eve 2016, Siobhan and her partner Nick Williams, 48, were given an exact diagnosis. Their son had stage 4 B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and he needed to start on intensive chemotherapy straight away.  Although the B-cell subtype of lymphoblastic lymphoma rarely manifests as solid tumours outside the lymph nodes, Dylan had many tumours all over his head and torso. Dr Richard Simcock, a Consultant Advisor at the Macmillan Cancer Support charity told Mirror that Dylan\u0027s form of cancer was very rare. He said that lymphoblastic lymphoma is itself a rare disease, occurring in about 11 cases per million population per year, usually presenting as enlarged lymph glands (lymphadenopathy). But only approximately 25% of that small total present with extranodal involvement (i.e. tumours not in the lymph glands), making Dylan\u0027s presentation particularly unusual. Mum-of-two Siobhan said: Dylan was lying in the hospital bed with what looked like 100 people suddenly working on him. It was intense and I was told later on that if his chemo did not start then he probably would not be here now. He was given the chemo drug Methotrexate which is bright orange and so nasty the nurses wear face shields and gloves over their elbows when they administer it.  You just don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening. It\u0027s an overwhelming feeling being helpless to help your child and you have to look to the professionals to do something. You\u0027re instinct as a mother is to pick him up and hold him but you can\u0027t. His cancer was so rare they had not seen it in the hospital for 17 years. His initial chemo lasted 8-9 months, it was really intense and the side effects were difficult. He was so weak he could barely walk. His long hair fell out and he struggled to write due to nerve damage. He had constant sickness, was incredibly fatigued and in constant pain.  At one point he had so many mouth ulcers he couldn\u0027t even smile. He was housebound for weeks and couldn\u0027t go to school, the hospital or the shops after his immune system became so weak that he could not fight off anything. His friends could not even come to play with him. If he even caught a cold he would have to be hospitalised for 48 hours on an extreme course of antibiotics. So far, Dylan has received 28 general anaesthetics, 55 rounds of chemo and 20 lumbar punctures. Every month, he has Methotrexate injected directly into his spine to flood his spinal fluid with the toxic but cancer-killing drug which then flows up to his brain to keep the aggressive tumours at bay.  But the difficult treatment plan managed to shrink Dylan\u0027s aggressive tumours and saved the little boy\u0027s life. Siobhan said: “The conclusion was that the chemo started working just in time. Without the referral from my GP and the fast response of the consultant who saw him he quite simply wouldn’t have made it.  Dylan\u0027s at school today which is good, he\u0027s getting stronger and I\u0027m hoping he might manage the whole day. Siobhan, from Cardiff, has two sons - her eldest Ruairi is 18 and Dylan is now 7.   She writes a blog called www.TheLittleBigC which helps her process the pain, fear and trauma of minding an acutely ill child while raising awareness about cancer.    Being on this journey makes you realise how many kids are in a similar situation. Cancer changes your perspective and makes you re-evaluate what really matters in life.  You suddenly have to find the resilience to help your child deal with whatever they will have to face. But the irony of going through a tough situation is that it brings peculiar positives I never would have thought of.  It\u0027s brought us even closer as a family and it has made us stronger. Siobhan said that Dylan is improving every day but the future is still uncertain.       Now Dylan looks great. His hair is growing back and he is regaining his strength. He\u0027s started to ride his bike again and it just gives me the most immense pleasure to do regular things like bring him to the park and see him eat ice cream. Or see him able to play with his friends again. It\u0027s a cliche but it\u0027s true that the little things in life are the most important. Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) is a rare type of fast-growing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).  It mainly affects people under 35. It is similar to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and is treated in a similar way. LL starts when white blood cells, called lymphocytes, become abnormal and grow in an uncontrolled way. The abnormal lymphocytes build up in one or more parts of the body. The most common symptom is a painless swelling in neck, armpit or chest. Other symptoms may include:  • breathlessness  • cough  • chest pain  • night sweats  • weight loss  • high temperatures (fevers). LL can affect other areas of the body. Other symptoms depend on where in the body the lymphoma is growing. To diagnose lymphoma, a doctor removes a sample of cells (biopsy) from an affected area to be checked for abnormal cells. You will also have tests and scans to find out more about the lymphoma. LL is treated with chemotherapy. Some people may have radiotherapy. Sometimes a stem cell transplant is used to treat LL that comes back. You may be invited to join a clinical trial looking at new ways of treating LL. You can talk about this with your lymphoma doctor.

We don\u0027t know what his prognosis is and he will probably need to be monitored all his life. He may never be able to have children, his heart will always have to be checked due to the affects of chemo, he has nerve damage and he may always have mobility issues.

The heat is expected to top the previous record of 32C - and temperatures are going to stay high this weekend and into next week.  However, there is still little sign of any prolonged rainfall with no significant precipitation recorded since the end of May. Some scattered showers will develop over Britain during the weekend but most areas will remain dry and warm. An amber level heatwave alert has been issued for western parts of England with temperatures soaring over the next few days. London and the South East will bear the brunt of the sweltering conditions — which will last into tomorrow as England take on Sweden in the World Cup quarter final in Russia.    High pressure will dominate the weather with prolonged periods of sunshine and more scorching air from the continent blocking any periods of cooler, unsettled Atlantic conditions. This has created an area of clear air above the UK, where cloud is suppressed and winds have been low to allow maximum heat to come through from the sun. Hot conditions are expected to continue into next week. It may be sporadically cloudy and slightly fresher in the northwest at times with a little more rain or drizzle . However, for those wanting a respite from the heat, there is some hope on the horizon.   More unsettled weather may start to develop later this month with occasional spells of more changeable conditions edging across the UK, particularly in the north and northwest. But to end the month, it looks as though the hot, dry weather will return for much of the country with plenty of warm sunshine. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: “A slightly slacker pressure pattern will allow marginally cloudier, cooler and more showery weather to end the week, but temperatures remain in the mid to high 20s C widely and staying dry and sunny for most.

Yvonne Radcliff, 74, had to turn around and go home after heading for a day out to Birmingham\u0027s new \u0026pound7 million Legoland Discovery Centre. She had set off from her home in Hall Green in the city to the new attraction which opened on Thursday. But the Lego-loving pensioner had her plans for a day out shattered when a staff member told her that no adults could enter without a child.  Yvonne told Birmingham Live: “I couldn’t believe it.  Adults make Lego, it’s wonderful. Yet I wasn’t allowed in because I didn’t have a kid with me. You couldn’t make it up really.  “I think Lego is fascinating. I’ve watched documentaries on TV and saw it was opening in town. “I told my daughter I fancied a day out to see it, so I got on the train to Snow Hill and walked the rest of the way there. “Once I got there, I walked in and a girl stopped me and said I wasn’t allowed in. She said it’s the rules - I must be accompanied by a child. She added: “I was shocked and appalled to tell you the truth. It’s nonsense really. “A family was in front of me so I said can I walk in with them as they had children, she just said ‘No, you’re a stranger’.  “You’d thought they’d take pity on a pensioner - and the kids aren’t off school yet. “I just had to walk away and go back home.”  The Legoland Discovery Centre website states that “adults must be accompanied by children to enter Legoland Discovery Centre”.  The new venue is, however, staging an adult-only evening for Lego fans on July 11 between 5pm and 7pm. In a detailed statement, a spokesman for Legoland said: “LEGOLAND Discovery Centre’s are not theme parks but small, indoor attractions specifically conceived and designed from a child’s perspective to provide safe and fun environments for families with children aged 3-10 to enjoy together.

A study of 2,000 adults identified this as the stage in their lives when they feel they can no longer don the clothes they used to - and instead have to ‘dress their age’. At this point, two thirds become less experimental with what they wear and simply stick to ‘what they know’. Almost half are too embarrassed to adorn ‘on-trend’ clothing and two in five struggle to know what suits them.   Commissioned by savings site VoucherCodes, the research also found 28 per cent of Brits think they dress younger than their actual age.  Anita Naik, lifestyle editor at VoucherCodes, said: “For many of us, what we wear is very much part of our identity and how we want to be perceived by others. “You’d assume that by the time you reach your late 30’s you’ve got your style down to a tee, but how we want to be perceived can change as we get older.  “The results suggest we become a little more subtle with our style as we get older – making us less likely to commit fashion faux pas.” The research found it’s a myth that those in their 30s and 40s stop trying to keep up with the latest fashion. In fact the average 35 to 44 year old spends \u0026pound321.57 on clothing a year – more than any other age group. But sadly around one fifth of items bought stay in the wardrobe - never to be worn. Overall men and women will spend a total of \u0026pound14,210 and \u0026pound20,740 on clothing respectively during their lifetime.  Men will end-up wasting a total of \u0026pound2,292 on pieces which end up in the bin or the local charity shop - and similarly, women will spend \u0026pound3,343 on fashion they later regret buying.  Carried out through OnePoll , the research also found the typical woman will adopt five different styles or looks and the average man will adopt four - throughout their adult years.  It also emerged four in 10 Brits have items of clothing they think they are now too old to wear - although 15 per cent also own pieces they think they are too young for. Around one third of Brits are self-proclaimed ‘followers of fashion’.

Rachel Lapierre\u0027s big win in 2013 saw her bag a guaranteed $1,000 (\u0026pound605) every week for the rest of her life. But instead of spoiling herself, the former beauty queen has been giving her money to prop up her amazing charity. The Canadian was already involved in helping others work when her numbers came up.  But she is now using her winnings to bring joy to other people in her native Montreal, as well as countries like Haiti Sengal and India, BBC reports.  Her work ranges from providing hot food and clothes to the homeless in Quebec to street clinics in Kolkata. The selfless Ms Lapierre said: Money is money. When you\u0027re born you don\u0027t have anything.  And when you go [die], you go with nothing but your memories. You go with what you did here in life. We just try to promote good deeds. Good deeds can be so many things. It can be a bike, it can be food, it can be transport to go to the hospital. It can even be just listening to somebody on the phone because they are lonely. I think happiness comes from the heart. It\u0027s nice to have a new home or car. It can be really fun - but you don\u0027t need that to be happy. Kind Rachel, 56, left her nursing career behind her just months after winning the Lotto.  And she wasted no time launching her very own charity Le Book Humanitaire .   In the 1980s Rachel\u0027s life was very different. She joined a local modelling school and as a result entered Miss Quebec. She won in 1982, and aged 21 toured Canada in the following year. But while the world of pageants and modelling might seem a million miles from running a charity, Rachel sees similarities. She said: At 20, I loved helping, but I did not know that I would necessarily go in that direction. I learnt everything I could. I realised that giving pleasure made me happy and that doing good deeds fed me. Her success led to her setting up her own modelling school, to help young women build careers in the industry.

There will also be work done to put in toilets and disabled facilities for customers and a servery, kitchen and staff room in the back of the property.Blend describes itself on its website as “a diverse band of friends united in our passion for people to experience some of the best coffee and tea the world over”.The Perth branch made headlines recently after hosting a new “Menopause Cafe” for people to talk and support each other with menopause issues.Reform Street was previously dubbed “Dundee’s Saville Row” during its boom period in the 20th century, known for its large number of clothes shops.Although the street has been hit by a series of high-profile store closures in recent years, it has seen something of a resurgence as an up and coming eating out destination.Project Pizza, German Donor Kebab, Coffee \u0026amp Co and Dai Pai Asia Street Food have all opened up on in recent years.Last month it was announced that German Donor Kebab owner Akky Hayat will open another eatery in the street – Hollywood-themed burger joint Fatburger \u0026amp Buffalo – in September.Recently released figures revealed Dundee’s food and drink industry grew by £43 million in the space of just one year, between 2015 and 2016.Council planners will now consider the application for Blend, and write to the applicants with their decision in due course.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b335b8da880a.jpg ","title":"donkey joins in celebrations as dundee woman sandra turns 50","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBirthday girl Sandra McIntosh had an unusual visitor on her special day in the shape of Donkey Bond, a miniature donkey.Sandra, from Downfield, turned 50 and was delighted by the visit from the cute donkey who lives with owner Alison Wiseman at Balnuith Farm, Tealing.The surprise was arranged by Sandra’s fiance Scott Findlay and their friend Nicky Millen.Shocked Sandra said: \u0026#8220You don’t expect to open your door and a donkey to be there, do you?“Maybe flowers or chocolates but I would never have imagined Donkey Bond would be there.“He was so cute.

On the other side, I have to tell you they have trained very focused and hard for one-and-a-half weeks, so there was tiredness in their legs during the game.“We did play good football and passed the ball but there were some mistakes, especially in the middle of the pitch.”Tickets for the Betfred trip to Ross County later this month are on sale.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3de132c3d0e-877x564.jpg ","title":"fraser aird is ready for scotlands toughest test in getting dundee united out of championship","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFraser Aird’s Dundee United career got off to a cracking start with a brilliant solo goal in the friendly at Brechin the other night.And it goes without saying the Canadian international wants to build on the feelgood factor that started up at Glebe Park.As a veteran of the Championship from his time at Dunfermline, however, he knows some tough times lie ahead.Very tough, in fact, because the 23-year-old reckons this year the second tier will be the most difficult in the land.He said: “It’s a tough league. The teams coming down will have an expectation to go straight back up.“Then there are teams that have been down there for a while that will have a real go at getting up.“I would probably goes as far as to be saying in Scotland right now it is the toughest league.“The Championship is the most competitive but we are a club that have ambitions and we are one I think should be in the Premiership. I think we can all agree on that.”That’s pretty much all he has to say on that last point. He knows the best place to show United’s intent won’t be in interviews but out on the pitch and by getting results.And as Csaba Laszlo’s new-look side gels, he’s confident that will be the case.“We need to do our talking on the pitch,” he added.“Hopefully, all the pieces will come together during the season and the goal is to get to the Premiership.“It is going to take time but the pre-season games and the Betfred Cup games before the league season starts are all preparation for the first game against Dunfermline.“And the Betfred Cup gives us competitive games before the season starts but at the end of the day it is part of our preparation for the start of the league.“It’s a lot better playing games than training all the time but we do want to go on a nice cup run as well.”The early signs up at Glebe Park were encouraging and Aird admits he was pleased with how things went for both himself and his new team-mates.“Obviously, I was delighted to get a run out and get the goal. It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me. Obviously, the manager has a vision of the way he wants the team to play and the direction he wants to go.“It’s an exciting time ahead for the football club and I am glad to be part of it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hannah nets dream job at overgate gift shop after chance meeting on way to another interview","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“I absolutely love my job so was more than happy when I got asked to be store manager.”Hannah Murdoch, 24, began working at the Little Thistle Gift shop a week after it opened its doors in October 2015.After working in retail since she was at school, Hannah got the job after a chance encounter with the shop’s owner.She said: “I was actually on my way to another job interview when I noticed the shop had opened in the Overgate.“Little gift shops like this are my favourite kind of store so I always have to go in when I see one.“After chatting to one of the owners, Kevin, he told me to hand in a CV since I was looking for a job.“I got a call from him asking me to come in for an interview and they offered me a job there and then.“I absolutely love my job and after working here for a year, I was asked to become store manager, I was so shocked but more than happy to take on the role.”The Little Thistle Gift Shop’s secret is definitely it’s superb range of gifts – and Hannah says she loves being able to talk to customers about the products.“We have a lot of suppliers that we sell in store but it is very important to that the shop stocks local, independent products.“The owners Kevin and Tracey also make some of their own products which we sell.

Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Friday 6 Jul 2018 5:34 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/01828000/01828031.jpg","title":"Druim Ba wind farm rejected","story":"Plans for 10 turbines at Druim Ba between Kiltarlity and Abriachan have been rejected today by the Scottish Government after a second public inquiry.\u0026nbspGeneral wind farm campaigner Lyndsey Ward was \"delighted\"She said: \"The community has had seven years of wind farm developers trying to get a wind farm in that area.

official opening of the new low-impact buildings and other events at the project\u0027s base in Glen Strathfarrar over two days.One bothy has been dedicated to Strathfarrar-born Pipe Major Willie Ross

contemporary issues of sustainability and local culture.\"The new low-impact buildings, which are similar to the highly popular Nordic summer huts, will provide comfortable accommodation for schools,

from Scottish and Southern Energy towards infrastructure work.Additional financial support has come from Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Highland Leader programme and Social Investment Scotland.The project also hosted an open day and an end of term show by the Summerlings Outdoor Nursery which opened last year to provide young children with the chance to spend most of their time outdoors exploring, playing and learning.Since starting in 2015, the Shieling has built 15 structures and raised funding of \u0026pound330,000 while its revenue income trebled last year.It has provided more

due to start on Monday.Other roads across the city \u0026ndash including Midmills Road in the Crown area and Caledonian Road and Montague Row in Dalneigh are also set to have their potholes filled in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland. He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface. It\u0027 getting worse because of the amount of traffic.\"A lot of people use the road and the potholes have become a real problem.

smaller session with the outgoing primary 7 pupils.They had each been tasked with inviting someone who inspires them to hand out academic achieve-ment prizes.Gregor said: “A pupil from Hazlehead Primary – also called Gregor – wrote to me a few months ago inviting me to his end of term assembly.“I also received an invite to the St Machar Academy awards, and fortunately both events were on at different times during the same day, so I was able to attend.“I am pretty sure the highlight for the pupils, staff and parents was the appearance of the Calcutta Cup which I was able to bring along. I really enjoyed the day and it was great to share some of my experiences as a player and a coach with the two schools.”Hazlehead head teacher Barbara Jones said: “All the pupils had a discussion as part of the curriculum about who they would want to join them on the day, and then they selected someone that they were interested in, motivated and inspired by.“It’s a great experience for them to have someone who is at the pinnacle of his career, especially with the success of the team this year, come and talk to them. We need the positive role models, and he spoke to them about how you deal with things when they don’t work out the way you wanted. It was really helpful.”Councillor John Cooke, who was at the Hazlehead assembly, said: “I’d have enjoyed going to the assembly anyway, because I really like the ethos of the school around pushing kids to fulfil their potential, but it was a real bonus to meet Gregor.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"students moving urged to find out about a refund","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStudents are being urged to find out if they are eligible for a refund on their TV licence.As universities approach the end of term TV Licencing has said that more than 26,000 students in the north-east could get a £50 refund.The organisation has changed the way it calculates refunds meaning if students bought their licence in October and move out in May they could claim some cash back.To qualify, the students need to be leaving halls or another address and moving into a licensed address.Fergus Reid, spokesperson for TV Licensing in Scotland, said: “We’re encouraging all eligible students to take up the refund, which is quick and easy to apply for.“It’s important students buy a TV Licence when starting university to take advantage of the flexible payment options and avoid a fine of up to £1,000.”Students have been asked to change their address or apply for the refund by visiting www.tvlicensing/studentinfo, or calling 0300 790 6113.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"038ex0607eea_story__7","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThere’s substance to this summer story of Juventus not only wanting to buy Cristiano Ronaldo but Madrid being willing, at least, to talk to them about the deal.Whether a guy who has only refused to countenance returning to Manchester United because of the weather – something I know because he told one of his ex-team-mates recently and that team-mate told me – feels differently about grey, clammy, cold northern Italy in winter remains to be seen.Nevertheless, Cristiano is a strange animal and what he demands back for his Herculean effort to be as exemplary and as reliable as he is at his age is that no player, be he Messi or Neymar, can be allowed to out-salary him and also that Madrid show servile love for him.Think of it like this. Cristiano is obsessed with how he looks and would be furious with the mirror if it told him things he didn’t like. But that’s something he can take charge of himself and by all accounts his personal regime, aimed at leaving him able to keep on winning the Ballon D’Or and Champions League, is astonishing.But he’s also obsessed by how Real Madrid treat him. Which is something he feels he’s taking charge of too, by being their most important player (potentially ever) – but justifiably or otherwise it has been a long time since he’s been satisfied either with their treatment of him or by his salary.Now Juventus, I’d say, look an unlikely way for him to spend the autumn of his career, but two things play here. Firstly, when he scored that astonishing overhead kick in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in Turin the Juve crowd spontaneously applauded him and that hit Cristiano where he lives. He loved that and said so, publicly. Juve’s planning started there.Secondly, Juve have earned 275 million euros from the Champions League between 2014-2017 alone, a chunk of which they are clearly disposed to invest in a guy who turns 34 in February and who wants to be paid a basic 25m per season plus 5m in bonuses.It’s bonkers, but if you don’t shoot you don’t score.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency services respond to underground explosion in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPolice and fire services are responding to a major incident in Dundee’s Greenmarket area.Local people have reported hearing a loud explosion at around 8.30am and emergency services were quick to reach the scene.A cordon has been thrown up and onlookers asked to stay well back, according to one witness.Police said buildings in the area had been evacuated as a precaution.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/Dogs-die-in-hot-cars-398x564.jpg ","title":"more than 10 people every day have called the sspca worried about dogs in hot cars","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Scottish SPCA has seen a major increase in the number of calls for people concerned about dogs in hot cars.In just 16 days, between June 18 and July 4, there were 210 calls from members of the public.And over the past year the charity has seen an 80% increase in the number of calls on this issue.Scottish SPCA chief superintendent Mike Flynn said: \u0026#8220We\u0026#8217re very concerned at the number of reports we\u0026#8217re receiving about dogs being left inside cars during the hot weather.\u0026#8220Owners need to understand that it\u0026#8217s completely unacceptable to leave a dog in a vehicle in these searing temperatures, even for a short period of time with the windows down.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"no more overnight closures at strone point","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/07/18, 3:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe second of two nights of planned closure on the A83 trunk road will no longer be needed.The closures \u0026#8211 on Wednesday and Thursday July 4/5 \u0026#8211 were planned to allow resurfacing work at the Strone Point realignment project, near Inveraray.Trunk road management firm BEAR Scotland announced on Thursday afternoon that the works carried out during the Wednesday overnight closure had progressed well, and the surface course of the new carriageway has now been completed.A spokesperson added: \u0026#8216No further road closures will be required during the remainder of these improvement works with traffic management now reverting back to a two way temporary traffic light set up for the final aspects of the project.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert expects no sewage running down streets","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/07/18, 2:18 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe reason for raw sewage running down Tarbert’s streets is under investigation.On Thursday June 28,  sewage was seen bubbling up through drain covers and running along the kerbsides on Harbour  Street.The cause of the discharge is as yet unknown, but investigations are under way.A Scottish Water spokesman said: \u0026#8216Our sewer response team carried out an investigation after reports of a discharge at a surface water pipe at this location.‘This involved using CCTV cameras to try and ascertain what caused this discharge.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"holiday goer caused ruckus prestwick","story":"NewsHoliday-goer caused ruckus at Prestwick AirportIan Graham acted in an aggressive and intimidating manner towards Steven Ringtoul, and made threats of violence in the presence of children.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post16:00, 28 JUN 2018NewsAyr Sheriff Court (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaygoer who caused a ruckus at Prestwick Airport has been fined.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep.

Identity cards can be faked \u0026ndash phone the company to verify their identity.\n\u0026bull Some companies offer a password system. Ask your utility providers if this can be used and if you have a password with a company make sure the caller uses it.\n\u0026bull Never let people try to persuade you to let them into your home even if they are asking for help \u0026ndash they may not be genuine. If someone is persistent, ask them to call at another time and arrange for a friend or family member to be with you.\n\u0026bull Never agree to pay for goods or give money to strangers who arrive at your door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot keep large amounts of money in your home.\n\u0026bull Remember, it\u0026rsquos your home.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings. One consequence is that people who are blind or in wheelchairs virtually have to stay on one side or the other.The Scottish Executive is a signatory to the February 2005 publication: Design Manual for Roads and Bridges.

Campbeltown, appeared from custody before Sheriff Patrick Hughes, charged with behaving in a threatening or abusive manner, likely to cause a reasonable person to suffer fear or alarm, by shouting, throwing a shopping trolley and breaking a window at an address in Campbeltown on June 10.During his trial, two witnesses gave evidence.The first witness, whose house is on the opposite side of the street to where the offences were alleged to have taken place, said she heard a commotion on the date in question and looked out of her window to see what was happening.She said she saw Deavy outside the other house, shouting, but she could not see if there was anyone else present.She came away from the window but 15 minutes later, when she heard \u0026#8216a smash\u0026#8217, she returned to see if anyone was hurt and saw Deavy leaving the property\u0026#8217s garden, \u0026#8216still angry\u0026#8217, she said.She said he threw a trolley that was in the garden to the side.Deavy\u0026#8217s defence solicitor, Mr Buchanan, asked the witness if what she had heard had just been an argument between two people, and if the two were \u0026#8216giving as good as they got\u0026#8217.The witness said that although she heard two voices, she could not hear what they were saying.The second witness, whose window was smashed, said Deavy had been taken to her property in a state of intoxication.Although he was usually welcome, she asked him to leave because he was drunk.When he did not, she decided to leave the property and go for a walk around the block and when she returned, Deavy was gone.When he returned later, the witness pretended she was not in.She said Deavy was chapping the door but she had closed the curtains.At some point she heard a bang and thought that Deavy may have fallen into the wheelie bins outside, but when she went to check she saw that the shopping trolley was over on its side, near to where it had been before.She said: \u0026#8216I sat in silence so he would think I was still away out.\u0026#8217Later, the woman went shopping and when she returned home, she found her window smashed so she called the police.She said that she would not have phoned the police about the earlier events if the window had not been smashed.Mr Buchanan said there was \u0026#8216no evidence at all\u0026#8217 of swearing or violence, and that there was nothing to suggest his knocking on her door was untoward.He said it had been \u0026#8216a drunk man, knocking at the door of a property at which he was welcome.\u0026#8217Procurator fiscal depute Eoin McGinty said it \u0026#8216could not have been any clearer that he was not welcome\u0026#8217 and cited the witness walking around the block and closing her curtains to avoid Deavy.Finding the charge against Deavy not proven, Sheriff Hughes said he thought the accused probably broke the window but there was insufficient evidence to prove it beyond reasonable doubt.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns european drum major champion","story":"Last Saturday, Campbeltown drum major Liam Renton, 25, won his second European title: 2018 European Adult Drum

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.

As soon as the discharge was detected, the process was \u0026ldquoimmediately shut down but \u0026ldquounfortunately some dust had already escaped into the atmosphere, said Tarmac.  The dry weather and wind direction resulted in the dust being carried towards Dunbar.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"  When the final of this year\u0026rsquos Scottish Black Pudding Championship was held earlier this month at the Edinburgh New Town Cook School, it was Anderson\u0027s Quality Butchers who came out on top.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

The pensioner then armed herself with a back scratcher and urged the man to get out and, after 15 minutes, she was able to force him from her home.  Joyce, who has lived at the property for 18 years, said: \u0026ldquoAt first I picked up my butter knife but he pushed that away, then I got my phone and told him I was calling the police but he just slapped it out my hand.  \u0026ldquoThat is when I picked up my back scratcher and tried to hit him.

Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

However, part-time students do not have access to the range of loans and bursaries available to full-time students making the cost of studying much harder to meet.  Susan Stewart, director of the Open University in Scotland, has called for the issue to be addressed in a forthcoming Scottish Government consultation.  Ms Stewart said a recent independent review of financial support, chaired by Virgin Money chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia, had an opportunity to address the issue, but had \u0026ldquoexcluded part-time students from its recommendations.  art-time study also includes higher proportions of disabled, low income and students from disadvantaged backgrounds compared to full-time study.  Writing in The Herald, Ms Stewart said: \u0026ldquoThese 236,000 part-time students, whether at college or university, aren\u0026rsquot currently eligible for financial support.  \u0026ldquoThe review was a chance to fix that. After all, it cited fairness, parity and clarity as its guiding principles.  Ms Stewart said Open University students often talked about an \u0026ldquoearnings trap where, having left school and started work, they found the cost of rent and childcare too much to pursue part-time study.  She added: \u0026ldquoPutting part-time students at a disadvantage based on the way they need to study doesn\u0026rsquot make sense and is not fair.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also an economic necessity. Demographic trends show us that, in a world of rapidly changing technology, we don\u0026rsquot have enough young people to fill the jobs we know are coming soon.  \u0026ldquoScotland is a small country and we need to take advantage of the talents of all of our people which means they need to be able to re-skill and upskill in order to change jobs and careers \u0026ndash for most people already in work, that means studying part-time.  The call for parity for part-time students was backed by academics and student representatives.  Mary Senior, Scotland Official for the University and College Union, said changes to student funding were a step in the right direction, but more needed to be done.  She said: \u0026ldquoThere needs to be greater flexibility with the timing of loan and bursary payments to address hardship issues students can face over the summer, and we need to ensure vital financial assistance is extended to part-time students.  Liam McCabe, president of student body NUS Scotland, welcomed the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos intention to look at the issue of part-time students.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe hope to see any future recommendations being probably resourced, and aimed at creating greater equity in the system.  Part-time higher education students, regardless of income or background, are not currently eligible for student maintenance support in Scotland.  Students earning less than \u0026pound25,000 may be eligible for the part-time fee grant, which waives tuition fees."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8028173.jpg?type=article-full","title":"thousands-of-new-scots-homes-bankrolled-by-record-european-loan","story":"  The Wheatley Group unveiled \u0026pound185 million of new funding from the European Investment Bank to help build and improve thousands of affordable homes across Scotland in a landmark deal hailed as by the First Minister as a benefit of Scotland\u0027s EU links.  It also marks a significant step in the wider push to tackle homelessness, high-rents and other housing hardships.  As part of the groundswell Wheatley Group earlier linked up with Edinburgh social enterprise Social Bite, which started as a sandwich bar and won the high-profile support of Prince Harry and George Clooney, to provide flats in Glasgow and across central Scotland for homeless people through the charity Housing First.  The EIB loan, described as being \"by far the largest of its type made in Scotland\", is linked to a commitment by Wheatley to invest \u0026pound400m over the next three years in affordable housing.    Above: Jonathan Taylor,\u0026nbsp Amy Rigby, Nicola Sturgeon, Kyle Wilson  This also includes refurbishing existing homes to meet new Scottish and EU energy-efficiency standards, helping tenants cut energy bills, and housing and integrating refugees into communities.  The deal was announced in Glasgow by EIB vice president Jonathan Taylor at a community event attended by Nicola Sturgeon and tenants, staff and apprentices from across Wheatley, along with local politicians, business, community and social housing leaders.  It takes the amount of funding raised by Wheatley in the past four years to \u0026pound800m and comes in the week the group was confirmed \u0026ndash for the second year running \u0026ndash as the UK\u0026rsquos largest builder of social-rented homes.  Wheatley is forging ahead with an ambitious building programme, from 2015 through to 2025, of 7,500 affordable new homes across the country in communities including Balloch, Dumbarton, Glasgow, West Lothian, Edinburgh and North Berwick.  Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Government is committed to reaching its target of 50,000 new affordable homes in three years time \"ensuring people have access to quality housing is a fundamental part of building a fair and equal society\".  She said the deal is \"also another reminder of how Scotland benefits from the EU and its institutions\".  Martin Armstrong, Wheatley chief executive, said the loan enables expansion \"but it is about so much more than simply bricks and mortar\".  \"Wheatley\u0026rsquos mission is to make lives, not just homes, better.\"  The group comprises six registered social landlords: Glasgow Housing Association, Dunedin Canmore, Cube Housing Association, Loretto Housing, West Lothian Housing Partnership and Barony Housing Association.  Alastair MacNish, Wheatley chairman, said: \u0026ldquoIt will help us to consolidate our position as the UK\u0026rsquos largest builder of social-rented homes, which we hold close as a badge of honour at a time when the availability and supply of affordable housing is such an acute priority.  Mr Taylor, speaking at the funding announcement at the Reidvale Neighbourhood Centre in Gallowgate, Glasgow, where GHA, is building 143 homes, said: \"New investment in social housing is crucial to increase the number of affordable homes and cut heating bills in existing properties.  \"This week\u0026rsquos visit to Glasgow provides a valuable opportunity to see how upgrading existing properties and construction of new social housing will improve lives, create skilled jobs, benefit local suppliers and cut heating bills in homes for hundreds of families.  The new \u0026pound185m EIB loan, along with future investments, will enable Wheatley to maintain a building programme of around 650 homes a year from 2021 to early 2025."},{"url":null,"title":"students-from-royal-conservatoire-of-scotland-are-amongst-most-employable-in-uk","story":"  New figures show the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is the best in the country for graduate employability - and fourth in the UK.

He said: \"The conservatoire is the only place in Europe where you can study all of the performing arts on the one campus and our innovative, multi-disciplinary curriculum equips students with the skills, knowledge and experience to enable them to flourish in the professional world.  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos national conservatoire is already recognised as one of the most distinctive institutions of its kind in the world and this latest endorsement further cements our status as a national and international centre of excellence for the performing arts.  David Lott, deputy director of Universities Scotland, said the overall figures showed Scottish universities were leading the way in the UK.  He said: \"Of all students who graduated last year, some 95.3 per cent were in employment or further study which is higher than the UK average and a real testament to the time and energy our institutions are investing in employability and ensuring that graduates are ready for the world of work.  \"Taken together with recent data revealing that graduates from Scottish universities earn more on average than graduates from elsewhere in the UK, these results demonstrate that our graduates can look forward to very successful careers after their studies.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-facing-cabinet-backlash-over-last-ditch-brexit-plan","story":"  The Prime Minister was criticised by leading Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg and former ministers who said she had abandoned her own red line on quitting the EU single market.  One MP called it a \u0026ldquobotch and a \u0026ldquocomplete mess that broke Tory manifesto promises.  The ferocious backlash piles pressure on pro-Brexit cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to reject Mrs May\u0026rsquos soft Brexit idea at a crunch meeting at Chequers today.  The pair tonight conferred with Brexit Secretary David Davis and other Eurosceptic ministers, including Esther Mcvey and Andrew Leadsom, in Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos office.  It followed reports that Mr Davis was also unhappy about the plan, telling Mrs May the EU would reject it because it would rely on the UK policing EU import tariffs.  Despite backing a single market in goods, the 100-page paper says the UK should diverge from EU rules on services, something Brussels has already dismissed as cherry picking.  After months of kicking the can down the road to avoid walk-outs from her divided cabinet, today\u0027s\u0026nbspmeeting is supposed to settle the UK\u0026rsquos preferred Brexit plan for customs and trade.  A White Paper next week should then form the basis of negotiations with the 27 other EU nations before the October deadline for a EU-UK deal.  Speaking after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday, Mrs May said she had gathered her cabinet \u0026ldquoto decide on a substantive way forward.  Mrs Merkel said Brexit talks were now entering a \u0026ldquocrucial phase.  The UK\u0026rsquos ability to strike trade deals is seen as a cornerstone of Brexit by its supporters.  However papers given to the Cabinet for the crunch meeting at Chequers about the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint propose a \u0026ldquoharmonisation of UK and EU rules that could scupper this.  They said the UK should make an \u0026ldquoupfront choice to align its rules with the rest of Europe on goods and agriculture, something which would antagonise the US in particular.  Donald Trump\u0026rsquos commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has already said he wants a post-Brexit UK to open itself up to US goods such as GM crops and chlorinated chicken, which are banned under EU standards, as part of broader transatlantic trading arrangements.  But the Chequers paper says \u0026ldquothe UK should maintain a common rulebook for all goods including agri-food, acknowledging this \u0026ldquowould not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal as the UK could not recognise US standards.  Mr Rees-Mogg, chair of a 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, said ending the UK\u0026rsquos regulatory alignment with Europe was a \u0026ldquored line and Mrs May should tear up the plan.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is not Brexit. This common rulebook means that we are essentially a vassal state. This would be directly contrary to the Prime Minister\u0027s own assurances.\"  Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said the plan was a botch, a complete mess and a \u0026ldquocomplete breach of Mrs May\u0026rsquos manifesto commitments to leave the single market, the customs union and the European Court of Justice.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe could not eliminate tariffs to reduce prices for consumers and businesses, or strike free trade deals. This would deny the economy the full benefits of Brexit... and be completely at odds with what 17.4m voted for. We would be out of Europe but still run by Europe.  Former Brexit minister David Jones added: \u0026ldquoQuite simply, this is not what people voted for in 2016. This is not Brexit.  Scottish Brexit Secretary Michael Russell said the Tories had become \u0026ldquothe lemming party.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell repeatedly refused to rule out resignations when Mrs May\u0026rsquos deeply divided cabinet assembles at her country retreat today.  He said: \u0026ldquoI think there will be robust discussions. Of course people have strong views in relation to leaving the EU. But at the end of the day it\u0027s about reaching an agreement.  \"I\u0027m confident that we can, and everybody should rally round that.  He said he would ensure any deal protected \u0026ldquothe integrity of the United Kingdom.  After a meeting with UK ministers in London on Thursday, Mr Russell published a list of demands - mostly the status quo - the SNP government wants to see in the UK blueprint.  Sebastian Kurtz, the Austrian Chancellor, said he would support delaying Brexit beyond March 2019 to allow more time for talks to ensure the Irish border issue was resolved.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur goal is to reach agreement [on the border]. If that\u0026rsquos not possible we need to avoid a hard Brexit. If not, it\u0026rsquos good to keep negotiating.  Asked if that meant extending the two-year Article 50 process, he said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll see?  Meanwhile Germany Industry UK, which represents 100 companies including BMW, Lufthansa and ThyssenKrupp said it needed \u0026ldquocertainty and clarity about the way forward sooner rather than later over Brexit or German investment in the UK would suffer.  Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u0026rsquos biggest vehicle manufacturer employing 40,000 people, this week said a bad Brexit would force it to rethink an \u0026pound80bn investment in the UK.  Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said the government was playing \u0026ldquoRussian roulette with tens of thousands of jobs by a government that \u0026ldquoplaces its survival, indulging narrow, extremist views, above the well-being of the people of this country.  Jaguar boss Dr Ralf Speth said the firm and its suppliers faced an \u0026ldquounpredictable future if frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market ended with Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"questions-asked-of-russia-after-novichok-couple-handled-contaminated-item","story":"  It comes after police say a couple who are critically ill may have been exposed to Novichok from handling a contaminated item.  Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley are currently fighting for their lives in hospital after being poisoned by the toxic chemical substance in Amesbury, Wiltshire, at the weekend.  It follows the highly publicised attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March.  Home Secretary Sajid Javid has demanded that the Kremlin provide an explanation for the two episodes, which investigators believe may be linked.  In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Javid said: \"The eyes of the world are currently on Russia, not least because of the World Cup.  \"It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on.\"  Making clear that the UK will \"stand up to the actions that threaten our security\", he added: \"It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns, to be dumping grounds for poison.\"  Mr Javid told MPs that he \"cannot rule out\" the possibility that the Novichok found in Amesbury was from the same batch used in the Salisbury attack.  However the Russian Embassy has hit back, accusing the Government of trying to \"muddy the waters\" and \"frighten its own citizens\".  Officers were called to a home in Muggleton Road on Saturday morning when 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess collapsed.  They were called back later that day when Charlie Rowley, 45, also fell ill.  Because the highest concentration of Novichok was found on the couple\u0027s hands, police believe the item they handled could be a container or reciprocal -- such as a vial or syringe -- used to transport the nerve agent for the initial attack on the Skripals and discarded in a public place.  Novichok remains highly toxic for a considerable period of time, so even the tiniest trace remaining in a container picked up by the victims could account for their severe illness.  It was initially believed that the two patients had possibly been using drugs from a contaminated batch, police said.  But after further tests, authorities declared a major incident and on Wednesday night counter-terror police assumed responsibility for the investigation after the Government\u0027s Porton Down laboratory concluded that the pair had been exposed to Novichok.  In a press conference, Chief Constable Kier Pritchard of Wiltshire Police defended his force\u0027s initial response, saying that he \"fully supports\" the decisions taken by officers who thought the couple had initially fallen ill after taking illegal drugs.  Amid questions about the post-Salisbury clean-up operation, Home Secretary Javid said the risk to the public remained low.  He added: \"We have taken a very robust approach to decontamination and there is no evidence that either the man or the woman in hospital visited any of the places that were visited by the Skripals.  \"Our strong working assumption is that the couple came into contact with the nerve agent in a different location to the sites which have been part of the original clean-up operation.\"  Earlier yesterday, Security Minister Ben Wallace said the Amesbury couple were not directly targeted.  Mr Wallace told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"The working assumption would be that these are victims of either the consequence of the previous attack, or something else, but not that they were directly targeted.\"  Linking the incident to the attack on the Skripals, Mr Wallace said: \"I think what we said at the time was that this was a brazen and reckless attack in the heart of a very peaceful part of the United Kingdom, and that is part of the anger I feel about the Russian state is that they chose to use clearly a very, very toxic, highly dangerous weapon.\"  Prime Minister Theresa May declared that Salisbury is \"very much open for business\" after residents raised fears that the new case will hamper the local economy.  The Met said that around 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Network are working alongside colleagues from Wiltshire police.  Six sites visited by Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess before they fell ill have been cordoned off. Police have extended this to include all of Muggleton Road and outside the supported living where Ms Sturgess lived.  Debbie Stark, deputy director for Public Health England in the South West, said that anyone who may have been in any of the cordoned-off areas after 10pm last Friday should take some precautionary measures about washing clothing and cleaning jewellery.  The episode in Salisbury - the first use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War - sparked international outrage.  Mr Skripal and his daughter have since left hospital.  A Russian Embassy spokesman said: \"All allegations of Russia\u0027s involvement in the incidents in Salisbury and Amesbury are merely speculative and are not based on objective data of the investigation.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8030619.jpg?type=article-full","title":"snp-childrens-minister-maree-todd-criticised-for-2lbs-of-sugar-recipe","story":"  Maree Todd, the minister for children and young people, posted her tablet recipe on Twitter despite government plans to restrict the marketing of junk food in shops.

It also said there was no appeal body for the watchdog\u0026rsquos decisions, and claimed that its role in reducing alcohol-related harm was \u0026ldquoneither clear nor explicit.

The charity\u0026rsquos chief executive, Richard Piper, said: \u0026ldquoWith roughly one person in the UK dying as a result of alcohol every hour, alcohol is no ordinary commodity, and we as a society have the right to set boundaries on the ways in which it is promoted.  \u0026ldquoThe current regulatory set-up doesn\u0026rsquot work. The UK Government could change that by initiating an independent review.  \u0026ldquoThe aim must be to make alcohol regulation fit for purpose, and ensure that regulators have a clearly defined remit and standards of evidence-based decision-making.  Portman Group chief executive John Timothy said: \u0026ldquoOur Codes of Practice set high standards for alcohol producers. The Codes provide a framework for the independent complaints panel to consider complaints and are regularly reviewed through open and public consultation.  \u0026ldquoOur rules apply equally to all alcoholic products and producers and we offer a free and confidential advisory service to prevent irresponsible marketing appearing in the first place.  \u0026ldquoThe reality of regulation on a statutory footing would be a slower and less efficient system than the current self-regulatory approach and an additional burden on the UK taxpayer."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-harrys-call-on-youth-leadership-as-meghan-shines-at-garden-party","story":"  Harry made the impassioned plea as he hosted a garden party to bring an end to the Commonwealth Secretariat\u0026rsquos week-long Youth Leadership workshop.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

That store has now been sold to the McColl\u0026rsquos group, which owns and runs newsagent shops across Scotland.Hugh is looking forward to a well-earned retirement. He said: \u0026ldquoThe hours involved have been close to 24 hours a day and seven days a week at times so I\u0026rsquom deciding to slow down a wee bit.\u0026ldquoGrant is still carrying on as he\u0026rsquos quite fit but I\u0026rsquom stepping back now after more than 50 years.\u0026ldquoThe family has done well with the shop.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Friday 6 Jul 2018 5:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal. One is 4.6 kilometres long and the other 2.7 kilometres.They will be used by Shell to develop the potential reserves in the Penguins field.Subsea7\u0026rsquos local site manager, Willie Watt, said: \u0026ldquoWe would be looking to make a start on this project by the autumn of next year and launch in the late spring of 2020.\u0026ldquoThis is very good news for the site and for Caithness. It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Friday 6 Jul 2018 5:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not! I\u0026rsquove lived a normal sort of life and I\u0026rsquove been lucky, particularly with my health.\"In recent years she has taken up using an iPad, can send emails and enjoys playing Candy Crush.Exhibition and sale days at The Muir Hub, which is on Great North Road, will be staged until\u0026nbspThursday between 9.30am and 4pm.Friday 6 Jul 2018 5:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is not clear why the paving moved but the extreme heat is suspected to be the cause.\"Meanwhile, emergency services were also called into action to tackle wildfires, including one in the Coulhill area of Alness on Tuesday.Firefighters were called to the scene of the 1000sqm blaze at around 10.30am, and remained on the scene for several hours before the fire was brought under control.And farmers in the area have voiced concerns that straw supplies could be set to run out amid the ongoing dry spell, with the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union urging members to be proactive in negotiating reasonable prices.Friday 6 Jul 2018 5:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A number of new schools have been built, which is brilliant for the pupils and communities that benefit.\"Despite receiving more funding than nearly all other local authorities, Highland Council still has the worst school estate in Scotland.\"The funding recognises the rurality of Highland Council, but most schools have been built in more densely populated areas like Inverness. It is of particular sadness that this funding has not gone further so that more school buildings could benefit.\"But Highland Council leader Margaret Davidson has defended the local authority\u0026rsquos track record, pointing out that it has 204 schools to maintain \u0026ndash more than any other area in the country. She added that Scottish Schools for the Future funding was welcome but added that current levels of funding from Holyrood are \"simply not enough to adequately invest in our schools\".She urged the Scottish Government to provide funding levels which recognise the unique challenges facing the Highlands, \"and in particular the very large number of schools, many of which are smaller schools, requiring urgent investment\".And she called for it to consider capacity pressures when allocating funding.\"If Kate Forbes wants to help Highland schools, then she should support our asks from government.\"Friday 6 Jul 2018 5:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If dogs are being kept outdoors, they must have an area of shelter where they can escape the heat of the sun.”Among the advice for pet owners is to allow dogs access to paddling pools, and using damp blankets for them to lie on in the shade during hot weather. SSPCA Deputy Superintendent Peter Fleming went on to give general advice for pet owners, “In this hot weather we would advise the public to ensure their pets stay hydrated, cool and a fresh supply of water should always be available.“Sometimes just keeping a window open at home or putting on a fan to let the air circulate the room will help provide a cool temperature for them.“Please don’t forget about wild animals too, who will benefit from bowls of water left in the garden.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765408.1530888820!/image/image.jpg","title":"bay city roller to pay tribute to late bandmate at scotfest show","story":"        Bay City Roller Les McKeown plans to dedicate a song to his late bandmate as he plays in Scotland for the first time since his death.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4763516.1530642722!/image/image.jpg","title":"professor john elliott what scots and catalans can learn from history","story":"\t\tRelations between Catalonia and Madrid soured in the 1800s as the Romantic Movement took off and inspired a new kind of nationalism, writes John Elliott.\t\t\t\tAs the current generation of Scots and Catalans face up to unusually agonising decisions about the future they want for themselves and their children, it is perhaps salutary to take a step back and consider how and why this dilemma has arisen.            This is what I have tried to do in my book, Scots and Catalans. Union and Disunion, a comparative  history of two peoples without states of their own, whose attempts to define, reassess and perhaps transform their relationship to the larger polities to which they belong has been drawing headlines across the world.             The book begins with the Middle Ages and ends in December 2017 after the flight to Belgium of the Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, following the failure of a unilateral bid to break away from the Spanish state and establish Catalonia as an independent republic.Many years ago I wrote a study of the origins of the Catalan rebellion of 1640 against the royal government in Madrid – a rebellion that inspired the creation of a Catalan republic which lasted for a week. As I contemplated the unfolding of today’s Catalan separatist movement and the simultaneous rise of Scottish separatism, I thought it might be illuminating to attempt a sustained comparison of the historical experience of the two countries and of the ways in which a sense of national identity has manifested itself over the centuries.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Stop treating Catalonia as a proxy for ScotlandNaturally there are important differences between the two national histories, but differences can be as revealing as similarities in reaching historical conclusions. One obvious difference is that Scotland was for centuries an independent kingdom, whereas Catalonia was never a truly independent state. It was a principality that formed part of a federation, the Crown of Aragon, which was united with the Crown of Castile as a result of the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. This dynastic union created the country that came to be known as ‘Spain’. Dynastic union between Scotland and England came more than a century later, when James VI of Scotland’s inheritance of the English throne in 1603 created ‘Great Britain’.  The immediate effect of these unions was similar, in the sense that, although both Scotland and Catalonia preserved their traditional forms of government, they were now linked to a far more powerful neighbour. This produced inevitable tensions, and at the start of the 18th century attempts were made to resolve them, although in very different ways. The 1707 Anglo-Scottish Union created a British parliamentary monarchy, in which the Scots surrendered their Edinburgh parliament in exchange for access to England’s expanding commercial and colonial empire.             In 1716, following the surrender of Barcelona two years earlier to the forces of Philip V, who was the monarch of the newly enthroned Bourbon dynasty, Catalonia, like the rest of the Crown of Aragon, was stripped of its traditional laws and liberties, and was merged into what became an authoritarian monarchical Spain.Scotland and Catalonia both benefited economically from the constitutional changes of the early 18th century, although the expansion of Britain’s overseas empire gave the Scots many more opportunities than those enjoyed by the Catalans. The British empire of the 18th and 19th centuries was a joint Anglo-Scottish creation, whereas the Catalans remained on the margins of Spain’s long-established American empire. Instead, they turned their energies to economic development, and became the pioneers of Spanish industrialisation, based on a rapidly growing textile industry. READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Catalonia is evidence of the benefits of a UnionScotland, too, was being transformed by the growth of its industries in the same period, but, unlike Catalonia, it never became the main power-house of the wider, national, economy. The long-term effect of these differences is still to be seen. In Spain, economic and political development were out of kilter in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While Madrid was the country’s political capital, its economic capital was Barcelona. In Britain, London was both.            In the 19th century, Catalonia’s relationship with the government in Madrid soured. This was partly the result of Spain’s chronic political instability in the decades following the Napoleonic invasion and the Peninsular War. But it can also be explained by a pan-European phenomenon, the emergence of a new-style nationalism inspired by the Romantic Movement. The researches of historians, literary scholars and folklorists into the origins of their societies generated a sense of the nation as an organic community with its own distinctive characteristics. Such explorations of the Catalan past helped produce another significant difference between Scotland and Catalonia. It was language that became the point of reference for national identity in Catalonia, in a way that Gaelic would never be for that of Scotland. The Catalans clung to their language when the repressive regime of General Franco sought to replace it with Castilian, the predominant language of Spain. After Franco’s death in 1975, a reaction was inevitable. The autonomous Catalan regime created by the 1978 Constitution of the newly democratic Spain was determined, through its control of the educational system, to ‘Catalanise’ Catalan society in the face of the encroachment of Castilian through the national media. The resulting linguistic question has played a large part in creating the current impasse between Catalonia and the Spanish government.It is one of the ironies of this stand-off that the 30 years between 1978 and the financial collapse of 2008 have been the most prosperous and successful in Catalonia’s colourful history. But the economic crisis gave radical Catalan nationalists a chance to depict Catalonia as the victim of a malign Spanish state, and the inflexibility of a Spanish government determined to treat the secessionist movement as a constitutional question that should properly be left to the courts handed the separatists a propaganda victory that they have exploited to the full. Referendums, whether authorised or unauthorised, as in the Catalan case, are at best blunt instruments for determining the will of the people. In forcing binary choices they can be deeply divisive, and Catalonia is now a bitterly divided society, in which intimidation is being exercised by secessionists who claim to speak for all its inhabitants. A highly creative people with a long and distinguished history, the Catalans deserve better than this.

Mike Russell, the Constitutional Relations Secretary in Nicola Sturgeon’s cabinet, said that people “require” such a ballot.

He told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme that this was the “issue that is going to haunt them”.Pressed on whether there should be a second European referendum, he stated: “I’ve been very sympathetic to that, the only caveat I’ve expressed, and it needs to be resolved, is what happens if that vote were to repeat what happened two years ago - Scotland to vote to stay and the rest of the UK to vote to leave.READ MORE: Scotland Office fights plan to strike down devolved Brexit legislation “We couldn’t do that twice.

They are not being helped by certainly the most incompetent UK government I have ever seen.“So there needs to be a clear choice. If the choice is Brexit Britain in this chaos and mess or independent membership of the EU, that would be a real choice.”The Liberal Democrats, who have been campaigning for a second Brexit vote, welcomed Mr Russell’s remarks.Scottish Lib Dem Europe spokesman Tavish Scott said: “It appears the SNP are finally starting to see the light. Mike Russell is right that the British people deserve to have the final say on whether Theresa May’s ropey Brexit deal is good enough.            “He does, however, need to give up on the constant caveats. This isn’t about political posturing. It’s about warding off economic disaster.“We’re two years into this process and the Cabinet is in the midst of yet another crisis meeting to settle on its position. That is absolutely ridiculous.“Political momentum is building for a People’s Vote and hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to fight for one. All pro-Europeans need to get on side before it is too late.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tired old games jamie halcro johnston ","story":"Regrettably, Humza Yousaf has once again chosen to play politics and attack MSPs who have stood up for the interests of Orkney and Shetland at Holyrood while he and his SNP colleagues were trying for months to pretend that their long-standing commitment to fair funding did not exist.\nThere is little doubt that, without this issue being raised up the political agenda, the SNP would have dropped their pledge to the people of the islands like a stone. So it is a shame that Mr Yousaf continues to play the same tired old games, even after the commendable efforts of councillors and MSPs of all parties and none has secured at least some action towards correcting this patently unfair situation.\nThe transport minister is right in congratulating the island councils for their tenacity in pursuing this issue. It\u0026#8217s just a shame it was the actions – or inactions – of his SNP government which forced them to be so tenacious.\nAnd what is now abundantly clear is that, in spite of the SNP\u0026#8217s protests, the money was always available to address this issue. The SNP managed to magic up an extra £170 million yesterday which, apparently, they didn\u0026#8217t have when the budget was first presented. So the question many in the Northern Isles should be asking Mr Yousaf is why didn\u0026#8217t the SNP include fair funding in their draft budget in the first place?\nWhen SNP ministers were trying to dismiss fair funding, I was regularly questioning them in the Scottish Parliament on their commitment. I was meeting with representatives from the island councils – in Lerwick, in Kirkwall and in Edinburgh.\nI put forward the amendment which, accepted by the entire Scottish Parliament (including Mr Yousaf and the SNP), recognised the lifeline nature of our internal ferries. And I wrote to Mr Yousaf and to his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, on the issue.\nSo I suppose it is flattering that, of all the opposition MSPs who voted against the SNP Budget, Mr Yousaf has chosen to single me out in this way for his faux outrage. I would suggest it\u0026#8217s an indication of the effectiveness of my consistent and vocal opposition to the SNP\u0026#8217s attempt to sweep its own fair funding pledge under the carpet.\nAnd in relation to the vote itself, Mr Yousaf seems intent on misleading Shetlanders. The truth is that MSPs do not vote on individual parts of the budget, but rather on the budget as a whole.\nSo, even with the late U-turn on additional ferry funding, this budget remains, overall, a disappointing budget for people and businesses in Shetland. It will mean that many of my constituents – in fact, anyone earning over £26,000 per year – will pay more tax.\nIt will hit the incomes of local people and businesses, something numerous business organisations have warned will harm Scotland\u0026#8217s already sluggish economic growth. And it leaves our local councils across the region still having to make tough spending decisions. So it is for those local and regional MSPs who supported the SNP\u0026#8217s budget to defend their decision. I simply wasn\u0026#8217t prepared to back a budget which will leave too many local people out of pocket.\nAnd an inconvenient fact Mr Yousaf, too busy patting himself on the back for belatedly delivering something even the SNP in Orkney accept was always an SNP commitment, choses to ignore is that this is only a deal for this year and not a long term solution.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

This was affectionately branded the \u0026#8220Emmerdale\u0026#8221 farm.\nIn 1998 the firm was one of two which set up in newly opened fish processing units at Gremista, funded by the Lerwick Harbour Trust (now Lerwick Port Authority) and Shetland Enterprise.\nNearly 20 years after that optimistic opening, the storied business is to close its final chapter.\n\u0026#8220We kent it was in the air\u0026#8221, Mr McNab said, \u0026#8220we could see it was in the figures.\u0026#8221\n• More in this week\u0026#8217s print edition of The Shetland Times.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"short film celebrates communitys bruck collecting efforts da voar redd up ","story":"\nShetland Amenity Trust has been running the event for 30 years and commissioned the video to highlight the community effort.\nWhat started as a few hundred volunteers clearing beaches in 1998, soon expanded to over 20 per cent of Shetland’s population taking part annually.\nTrust environmental improvement officer Sita Goudie said: “During its 31 years, over 100,000 volunteers have taken part in Da Voar Redd Up, collecting over 1,900 tonnes of bruck.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nFriday 6 Jul 2018 5:39
