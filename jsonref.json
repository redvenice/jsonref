But the UKHSA has noted a small number of people who have been reinfected with BA.2 after recovering from Omicron. Other studies have pointed to the subvariant being significantly more immune-resistant than the original Omicron, which would make it easier to infect vaccinated or previously infected people.  Whitehall sources told The Times earlier this week that they had not seen any evidence of significant changes in behaviour. But Government adviser Professor Stephen Reicher, a behavioural scientist on SAGE, told MailOnline that there was a growing impression that Covid is \u0027yesterday\u0027s news\u0027 and causing people to be more lax.He claimed that even people who wanted to take precautions were being forced into more risky behaviours because the majority of restrictions have been lifted. But a number of experts, including Dr Simon Clarke, a microbiologist at the University of Reading, believe the uptick in cases and hospital admissions is the early sign of waning booster immunity.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) last month recommended fourth doses to the most vulnerable age groups this spring, telling ministers they should be dished out around six months after their last vaccine. JCVI advisers originally recommended third doses on September 14, with over-75s, care home residents and patients with serious underlying health conditions first in the queue. Pfizer\u0027s booster drops from 90 per cent effectiveness against severe disease from Omicron to around 75 per cent after 10 weeks, according to the latest data. "},{"url":null,"title":"Adnan Syed scores legal win evidence tested DNA","story":"Share this articleBaltimore Sun - We are currently unavailable in your regionMaryland Requests New DNA Testing on Evidence in Hae Min Lee\u0027s Murder Case | PEOPLE.com"},{"url":null,"title":"Russians slam state TV pundits traitors DEFY Putins propaganda campaign","story":"Share this articleOff-message Russian state television pundits branded ‘traitors’ for criticising Ukraine war"},{"url":null,"title":"Queen unlikely meet Lilibet Prince Harry slammed refusing travel Britain","story":"Share this articleShare this articleQueen \u0027unlikely\u0027 to meet Lilibet after Harry\u0027s decision to miss Philip memorial service \u0026amp royal rift \u0027remains unhealed\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"cramping my style street art that highlights london living conditions in pictures","story":"His street art, Brickflats, reflects the cramped living conditions many endure.

We rally wanted to make it right for Ewelsy and the forwards did an incredible job, for the vast majority of the game we managed to bully them.”They certainly did, Nora. An incredible effort that discombobulated Ireland for large parts of the game.I thought it was great game, which by no definition could be classed as ruined. Again, I disagree, that was objectively a good game of rugby.  Also, it’s not the laws’ or the ref’s fault that Charlie Ewels decided to tackle upright with force - something all coaches and tackling players have been told is a no-no for the best part of three years. Maybe Eddie Jones much hyped talk of physicality in the build up backfired on his own team?But, because rules, Jamison Gibson-Park has been given it.Sexton adds the two points.I didn’t say they went on to win, I said there’s not a lot of evidence the games are ruined.Sometimes sport is an emotional game, and England’s emotions and running rampant over Ireland at the moment.Frankly, even with England’s huge emotional commitment here, Ireland’s issues are much of their own making.“This game has been ruined as a contest after 90 seconds. 80,000 people in the stadium. Millions watching around the world. Red cards should mean player permanently excluded and team a man down for 15mins. Can then bring on a replacement.”  I respectfully disagree, Christopher. For the main reason that I don’t believe red cards ruin games if you look at the evidence of the actual games they happen in as this one has also demonstrated. Plus, red card offences should have a significant impact on a team, they are the most egregious infringements in the game.Smith tees it up again and this time slots it.And another penalty as Iain Henderson enters a maul from the side at the next lineout. The noise is high in Twickenham as the crowd sense something happening here.Smith steps up and gets his side on the board.Ireland will need to not let hubris set in here in the midst of this conspicuously unusual start.  In the latest bad news for England, Tom Curry is limping off to be replaced by Alex Dombrandt.But, it looks like Ringrose fumbled it forward at the base of a previous ruck. No Try. However, that passage showed England have a great deal to worry about when Ireland get on the front foot.England have a scrum on the Ireland 10m line as they try to sort out just what the hell they do from here in. The first thing is they’ve put Jack Nowell into the openside flank.Sexton can’t slot the extras from out wide.At the end of all that, Sexton kicks the penalty to put Ireland ahead.Ryan is being looked at, and the Ref wants a good look at the tackle...Courtney Lawes then leads out England to a swell of noise.  Eddie Jones has confirmed that Itoje is recovered and definitely starting. Andy Farrell has refused to be drawn on the Jones’s midweek kidology, meeting questions with a wall of PR speak about “process” and the like.“He has what Liam Neeson might call a very particular set of skills – skills acquired over a very long career.” Andy Bull takes a look at Peter O’Mahony’s role today. Why not send them my way by email or on TwitterLast minute bugs-going-around news aside Joe Marchant is in outside centre, Elliot Daly takes a seat on the bench. In the pack, Jamie George starts at hooker while Sam Simmonds starts at No 8 ahead of bench-bound Alex Dombrandt. Can’t help but feel this is the proper ‘international arrival’ opportunity to Simmonds, but will he take it?  Jamie Blamire and Joe Launchbury also return to the matchday squad, both on the bench. Ireland played Italy last time out, so there’s changes aplenty, but this certainly has more than a whiff of what Farrell considers to be his first choice team at present.  One of the most fascinating things about the Six Nations is that the low number of fixtures imbues the result of so many game with much importance. Like a reverse-baseball season. This match is not only a massive clash because of all it brings in its own right, but there is a lot riding on it for both teams. England lose this and they head to Paris next week with the real possibility of only two tournament match victories - a win changes the whole complexion of the year for them. This is not lost on Eddie Jones who has spent all week with his mindgames settings all the way up to eleven, calling Ireland “the most cohesive side in the world” while throwing shade that they “haven’t played a game as physical as this in a long time”. Andy Farrell, a man who spent the majority of his playing career in the unstoppable behemoth of the 1990s Wigan RLFC team, will have little trouble dealing with the mentality that is required when favourites. Ireland need a win to maintain maximum pressure on France and also to cement their position as clearly in the top two in Europe alongside Les Bleus with daylight before the rest hone into view.  On form and personnel Ireland should win this in a way not unlike that which despatched England in Dublin last year. But this is Twickenham, away wins are not easy to come by here and the home team have yet to put in what constitutes a real performance yet.

More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Phenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists saving worlds banana crop","story":"The 1943 Louis Prima hit “Yes! We Have No Bananas” became the unofficial theme tune for rationing during the Second World War when the Ministry of Food banned the import of the fruit to save ships.But now scientists have found a way to make sure bananas remain on grocery shelves.Cambridge University has discovered how to graft species of banana together to transfer beneficial characteristics, such as disease resistance - a task that was believed impossible before now “I read back over decades of research papers on grafting and everybody said that it couldn’t be done,” said Dr Greg Reeves, a Gates Cambridge Scholar in the University of Cambridge Department of Plant Sciences, and first author of the paper.“I was stubborn enough to keep going - for years - until I proved them wrong.”The breakthrough comes at a crucial time when banana plantations are under threat from soil-borne pathogens including Panama disease which has been destroying drops for over 30 years.A recent acceleration in the spread of this disease has prompted fears of global banana shortages.Single variety vulnerable to diseaseThe world’s banana industry is based on a single variety, called the Cavendish banana - a clone that can withstand long-distance transportation, but has no genetic ersity, making it vulnerable to disease. Cavendish bananas are also sterile so disease resistance cannot be bred into future generations of the plant. Until now it was thought impossible to graft grass-like plants in the group known as monocotyledons because they lack a specific tissue type, called the vascular cambium, in their stem.But scientists have found that when tissue is still embryonic in seeds, it can fuse sufficiently with a different species, allowing for grafting. It means that species can be combined without the need for genetic modification. “We’ve achieved something that everyone said was impossible, said Professor Julian Hibberd in the University of Cambridge’s Department of Plant Sciences, senior author of the report.“We found that even distantly related species, separated by deep evolutionary time, are graft compatible.Grafting embryonic tissue holds real potential across a range of grass-like species.Technique transferrable to other plants There are an estimated 60,000 plants that are monocotyledons, including food staples like rice, wheat and barley. Being able to add helpful traits could bring huge benefits to the food industry. The team has also shown it works in pineapple, onion, tequila agave and date palm by injecting fluorescent dye into the plant roots – from where it was seen to move up the plant and across the graft junction.“It’s an urgent challenge to make important food crops resistant to the diseases that are destroying them,” added Dr Reeves.“Our technique allows us to add disease resistance, or other beneficial properties like salt-tolerance, to grass-like plants without resorting to genetic modification or lengthy breeding programmes.”The researchers have filed a patent for their grafting technique through Cambridge Enterprise. “Panama disease is a huge problem threatening bananas across the world. It’s fantastic that the University of Cambridge has the opportunity to play a role in saving such an important food crop,” said Dr Louise Sutherland, Director Ceres Agri-Tech, a collaboration between Cambridge, four other universities and three agricultural research institutes.The research was published in the journal Nature.More from NewsOxford and Cambridge to \u0026#39return looted Benin Bronzes to Nigeria within months\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine latest: Vladimir Putin shows \u0026#39no willingness\u0026#39 to end war, warns France Equalities watchdog launches study aiming to ‘reduce distress’ in trans debatePoland says it ‘can’t take any more’ Ukrainian refugees and asks for international relocation systemCharity Commission bans group which claimed to successfully treat cancer with juice drinksDuke and Duchess of Cambridge to follow in Queen\u0026#39s footsteps with first Caribbean tourMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"council apologises wrongly boasting low traffic neighbourhoods","story":"More from NewsOxford and Cambridge to \u0026#39return looted Benin Bronzes to Nigeria within months\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine latest: Vladimir Putin shows \u0026#39no willingness\u0026#39 to end war, warns France Equalities watchdog launches study aiming to ‘reduce distress’ in trans debatePoland says it ‘can’t take any more’ Ukrainian refugees and asks for international relocation systemCharity Commission bans group which claimed to successfully treat cancer with juice drinksDuke and Duchess of Cambridge to follow in Queen\u0026#39s footsteps with first Caribbean tourMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"did britains zero covid policy blight generation lifetime","story":"In normal times, there is a shocking poverty gap when it comes to how our children do at school. By the time they arrive for their very first day, disadvantaged kids are already four months’ learning behind their more privileged peers. Yet these are not normal times. Two years of Covid shutdowns have led to educational consequences that grimly rival those of a deprived upbringing – but for all.After the first lockdown, for example, the latest data suggests average primary school pupils were 3.6 months adrift of the level in maths that pre-pandemic years had achieved at the same stage. Children in some parts of the country fared far worse. In Yorkshire and the Humber, the gap was 5.7 months. When it came to reading, primary children unlucky enough to find themselves in the Covid cohort were on average just under two months behind. The question now for teachers, parents and the Government is whether they will ever catch up, or whether the years of disruption they have encountered today will cascade through the rest of their lives, impacting university and career prospects and their personal lives, too. It was never meant to be like this. But temporary emergency measures have morphed into a two-year trial, with repeated lockdowns, homeschooling, and the pingdemic puncturing entire class bubbles. Still, it goes on.In January, almost one in 12 teachers was off work. Last week, MPs declared the Government’s £5 billion National Tutoring Programme to help disadvantaged children “level up” after Covid to be a costly failure. Meanwhile, according to the Centre for Social Justice, 100,000 “ghost children” – those who miss more than half their school sessions – have almost entirely disappeared from education since last year’s return to schools.Making good will not be easy. Deprived children may start school only four months behind, but generally they don’t catch up. According to Natalie Perera, CEO of the Education Policy Institute (EPI), by the time they leave education, the gap has widened to 18 months. So will Britain’s Covid cohort suffer a similar fate?The stakes for them, and the nation, could hardly be higher. Work by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests that every extra year of schooling adds eight per cent to lifetime earnings. Other studies put the figure even higher, between 10 and 15 per cent. Using these estimates, the EPI has calculated that Britain’s Covid cohort is likely to lose between £15,604 and £30,881 each over their careers. Pessimistic scenarios put the loss as high as £46,321 per child – adding up to £463 billion for all affected children in England. The World Bank calculates that, globally, such Covid-inflicted salary losses could add up to an astonishing $10 trillion (£7.6 trillion).Nor are the impacts on children purely academic, or their consequences solely financial. Repeated lockdowns are likely to take a significant toll on young people’s physical health given that, in 2019, a study suggested that people were 6.85 per cent less likely to report poor health in later life for one additional year of schooling.Meanwhile, surveyed by the charity Young Minds, two-thirds of children said they expected repeated lockdowns to leave long-term scars on their mental health. This is borne out by teachers who have seen children regress, not just in their studies, but in their social behaviour. Suddenly, the function of classrooms not just as places of learning, but of pastoral care, has become all too evident.Many places saw a rise in children referred to social services. In Middlesbrough, the number rose by 40 per cent year on year. As Amanda Spielman, Ofsted’s Chief Inspector, wrote in her recent annual report: “This was a difficult year to be young, and a challenging time to be learning. In all phases of education in 202021, most children and young people have learned less than they normally would have done. For many, the loss of education, disrupted routine and lack of physical and other activities led to physical and mental health problems. Loneliness, boredom and misery became endemic among the young.”After a wide-ranging survey, the Children’s Commissioner compiled some heartbreaking tales. One 10-year-old boy confessed: “My reading and spelling is not very good. All the words get muddled up and I need more help in class, but I can’t always have it.” A nine-year-old girl added: “Lockdown really stops children, because they can’t do that much stuff we love and it makes them go all shaky.”Some children will never have known anything else: six-year-olds now in Year 2 might be forgiven for forgetting the brief spell of normality they enjoyed after joining Reception in September 2019. By the following March, their educational landscape was blasted by the first lockdown their Year 1 was shattered by its successor in spring 2021. Headteachers are faced with pupils far behind usual developmental milestones: five- and six-year-olds in nappies isolated four- and five-year-olds, shorn of pre-school playdates, group childcare, contact with grandparents, and confronted by a world wearing masks, arriving on their first day with few words to express themselves, and boiling with frustration in consequence. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) found that more than three quarters of primary schools said pupils starting school in September 2020 needed more support with communication than in previous years. Isolated in the pandemic, with fewer opportunities for play, toddlers tested in the past two years for language, puzzle-solving and motor skills are far behind those tested last decade. “Things just began sort of falling off a rock,” said one scientist studying infant cognition.The damage may even be starting in the womb. The journal Nature recently reported on research suggesting that “pandemic-related stress during pregnancy could be negatively affecting foetal brain development”.Despite all this, there is cause for hope. Children – particularly young children – are rubbery creatures, with “bounceback-ability”. Researchers are confident that slow-starting toddlers can catch up. And at primary school age, too, the data shows that children released from lockdowns have pegged back some of their losses. By the end of last academic year, the average lag in maths had fallen from the 3.6 months of autumn 2020, to 2.2 months. Yorkshire and the Humber, which had fallen almost half a year behind, had recovered 3.8 months. Recovery is possible. Indeed, children have been shown to bounce back before, as they did after rural communities and schooling were hit (though much less severely) by the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001. They can overcome social barriers, too. In 1975, the psychologist Edward Tronick conducted the famous “Still Face” experiment which showed how toddlers of parents instructed to remain expressionless first courted their attention, then turned inward and withdrew. Repeating the experiment almost half a century later, this time with facemasks, did not produce the same results. The children were able to feed off other cues to communicate and bond. Older children, however, struggle more to recover. Secondary school children, who quickly fell behind an average of 1.5 months in reading after the first lockdown, have barely made up any lost ground after returning to class. It is tempting to tell parents that this is no problem – that all children are facing the same challenges and suffering the same setbacks. Yet study after study suggests this is not true. The gap between those who were homeschooled by well-educated, WFH parents with plenty of time, money and laptops and those who weren’t is growing wider and wider. Teachers struggle to  the ever-widening spectrum of ability they see in a single class. Those with funds flee to private schools, only entrenching inequality. The EPI is calling for a host of targeted measures – better early-years teachers, one-to-one tuition for struggling children, and afterschool activities rather than an extension of the school day, which might involve catch-up lessons but could simply be about socialising and sports.But it will take money. Total funding for education recovery in England now stands at £4.9 billion, or around £490 per pupil. That is considerably less than the Netherlands, say, where the figure is £2,100 per pupil. To truly make up for lost ground, the EPI suggests the Government will need to splash out another £8.6 billion.It is a sliding doors moment, with a generation’s education at stake. The consequences a bad start at school can have are clear: doing less well in exams, dropping out earlier, earning less, getting sicker and dying younger. “The pandemic has and will have a very considerable impact,” says Perera. “Time out of school has a long-term impact on employment outcomes as well as social and emotional health. We can’t say that they’ll never catch up, but what we do want is for the Government to acknowledge this and to provide more funding. The last thing we want to do is write this generation off.”More from NewsPriests escort humanitarian convoy into besieged Ukrainian city of MariupolOxford and Cambridge to \u0026#39return looted Benin Bronzes to Nigeria within months\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine latest: Vladimir Putin shows \u0026#39no willingness\u0026#39 to end war, warns France Equalities watchdog launches study aiming to ‘reduce distress’ in trans debatePoland says it ‘can’t take any more’ Ukrainian refugees and asks for international relocation systemCharity Commission bans group which claimed to successfully treat cancer with juice drinksMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeons childish attention seeking proves scotland","story":"One senses that Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, misses the limelight she grabbed when Covid-19 was at its zenith. She seems instead to seek other means to keep her name before the public. It might be better for all, however, if she did so in a way that did not risk provoking the Third World War.Last week she showed her absence of statesmanship by demanding Nato “keep its mind open” on a no fly zone over Ukraine. The clear effect of such a zone, as even 14-year old armchair generals realise, would be that if a Russian jet flew into that airspace a Nato one would have to shoot it down. All right-thinking people feel nothing but revulsion for what the Russians are doing to Ukraine. But a no-fly zone could become a war between a nuclear-armed Nato and a nuclear-armed Russia: and no-one can so sure that the psychopath, sadist and narcissist who runs Russia would not launch such a weapon – unless, of course, he has taken Ms Sturgeon into his confidence.Normally, when Scotland’s First Minister says something absurd, her political opponents hesitate to take her on. Happily, this was not the Conservative Party’s response this time, as it realised the lethal consequences of her idiocy. Ministers are at last prepared to expose just how far out of her depth she is. Alister Jack, the Secretary of State for Scotland, was right to call her remarks “utterly irresponsible”. The Ministry of Defence has briefed the Scottish government regularly on the situation, yet what Ms Sturgeon suggested was at odds with what Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, Chief of the Defence Staff, had advised the Cabinet.There is a further paradox: although Ms Sturgeon seems willing to provoke the Third World War, she also wants to scrap the Trident missiles that would give the United Kingdom and her Nato allies a reasonable chance of avoiding the apocalypse. But because the Government at Westminster opposes a no-fly zone, for eminently sensible reasons, she seems to feel she has to call for one, just as during the pandemic she had to implement restrictions that began earlier, finished later, and were just that little bit more draconian. Like a spoilt child in a playground, she always has to be different, because in her ignorance she believes different is the same as better, and she has always to be better than the English oppressor.Similarly, as those she claims to represent struggle with increased energy bills, she opposes more drilling in the North Sea: frankly, if she really cared for their interests, she would sanction it tomorrow, and re-open some of Scotland’s coalmines too. Instead, her other concern last week was to apologise to the 4,000 or so people (about 15 per cent of whom were men) charged with Witchcraft under the Scottish Witchcraft Act of 1563, which she branded “injustice on a colossal scale”. She now advocates pardons for them, as she introduces an Orwellian law to make misogyny a criminal offence. Her only regret must be that the Act pre-dates the Act of Union, and all the great witch hunts also happened before 1707: otherwise one presumes the English taxpayer would be ordered to pay reparations.This desperate attention-seeking is another sign that peak Sturgeon has long passed: and it is harmless in that it diminishes only her and the fundamentally unserious cause of Scottish independence which she represents. And that cause will remain unserious so long as Ms Sturgeon and her acolytes act in such a petulant and irresponsible fashion.However, trying to pretend she understands international statesmanship is a more perilous activity, and one that shows her deeply unfit to lead. A period of silence, as Mr Attlee once put it, would be not only welcome, but perhaps life-saving. More from NewsPriests escort humanitarian convoy into besieged Ukrainian city of MariupolOxford and Cambridge to \u0026#39return looted Benin Bronzes to Nigeria within months\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine latest: Vladimir Putin shows \u0026#39no willingness\u0026#39 to end war, warns France Equalities watchdog launches study aiming to ‘reduce distress’ in trans debatePoland says it ‘can’t take any more’ Ukrainian refugees and asks for international relocation systemCharity Commission bans group which claimed to successfully treat cancer with juice drinksMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"adorable jack russell no eyes","story":"Adorable Jack Russell with no eyes in desperate need of new homeSix-year-old Polly is currently up for adoption with Blind Dog Rescue UK and is hoping to secure a new home with loving owners committed to showing her the world through sound and scentPolly had to have both of her eyes removed Image: Blind Dog Rescue UKByPaige FreshwaterContent Editor:,  Mar |commentsAfter having her eyes surgically removed, little Polly became closed off to the world around her - and now needs an owner to help her out of her shell.The six-year-old dog had to have both of her eyes removed due to glaucoma, a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve.

The Prime Minister said it was simply incorrect and would obviously be extraordinaryhe had intervened to secure a gong for Lord Lebedev. But the claims reignited the row over the numbers of allies who have received gongs from the PM. Labour have demanded a “post-appointment assessment” to examine the contributions of peers the Prime Minister places in the Lords. Here we look at some of allies, cronies and Tory donors who have been handed top gongs. Evgeny Lebedev  The Prime Minister made Evgeny Lebedev, the media mogul and son of billionaire ex-KGB agent Alexander, Lord Lebedev of Siberia at the height of Covid in . The ex-London mayor had for years been a guest at parties hosted by the socialite who owns the Evening Standard. As Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson declared an “overnight stay” with Evgeny Lebedev on  April . Reports later claimed the future Prime Minister had gone to Palazzo Terranova in Perugia for a “weekend-long party - and was spotted dishevelled and without his security detail at San Francesco d’Assisi airport the next day. Claims emerged this week that intelligence officials had raised concerns about the gong - leading the House of Lords Appointments Commissionto advise against it.But a source told the Sunday Times Boris Johnson then personally intervened - meeting Lebedev in person while he was dithering over a lockdown - and that “particular quite damning bit of advice” was later withdrawn.Mr Johnson has insisted it is “simply incorrect” that he personally or directly asked for the advice to be reversed. Lord Lebedev has not spoken in the Lords since his maiden speech, and Insider revealed he had only attended the Lords three times - narrowly missing the six-month absence that triggers an automatic suspension.On Friday, Lord Lebedev, who holds British citizenship, released a statement, saying he was not some agent of Russia .The peer acknowledged that his father was a long time ago a KGB officer but denied being a security risk to this country Jo Johnson  On just one day two years ago, Boris Johnson put his former boss, a billionaire Tory donor, a former top aide and a Brexiteer cricketer in the House of Lords for le . But the most striking name in his peers’ list of  July  was that of Jo Johnson - his own brother. The long-awaited list was snuck out on a hot Friday afternoon, hours after an important Covid announcement. Its huge size was branded a mockery of democracy and slammed by the Lordsapos own Speaker.Jo Johnson stood down as an MP at the  election and resigned as a minister, saying he was torn between family loyalty and the national interest over his brother’s hardline approach to Brexit.David Harding The billionaire, who has donated large sums to the Conservative Party, was handed a knighthood in the  New Year Honours.Hedge fund boss David Harding was knighted for “services to philanthropy”. The -year-old’s gts to science and mathematics programmes include £million to Cambridge University in  - the largest ever single donation by a Brit to a UK university.However, he is also a major donor to the Conservative Party, having pumped more than £.million into the Tory war chest since . Sir David, who founded investment management firm Winton in , donated more than £m to pro-Remain groups in the EU referendum. In  he was named as a member of the Tory Leader’s Group, offering him the chance to dine with ministers including then-PM Theresa May. But he has also generously helped the party under Brexiteer Boris Johnson, donating almost £, to the Tories since the PM came to power. His gts include a single £, donation a few weeks before the  election.Zac Goldsmith Tory Zac Goldsmith lost his seat in the  election after being trounced by the Liberal Democrats in Richmond Park.But he was swtly handed a le peerage by Boris Johnson so he could serve as Environment Minister in the Lords.The Tory, son of billionaire businessman James Goldsmith, ran in the  London Mayoral election but he was denounced for trying to suggest his Labour rival Sadiq Khan had links to extremists. A long-time ally of the PMaposs we Carrie Johnson, Mr Goldsmith made headlines last year for lending the couple his luxury Marbella villa for a sunshine break.Michael Spencer  The billionaire former treasurer of the Conservative Party was among the  receiving a Tory peerage in July . His firm IPGL Ltd has donated more than £m to the Tories since Boris Johnson became Prime Minister.He was another member of the Tories’ elite ‘Leaders’ Group’, listed as a dinner attendee in early  with either Boris Johnson, Philip Hammond or Theresa May, or all three.The City grandee slammed Theresa May in  for “letting herself down” in her relationship with business, saying the party had been foolish on occasion to adopt some of the language of the socialists”. He later poured money into target seats ahead of the  election landslide. Daniel Moylan  Now Lord Moylan, Daniel Moylan was aviation advisor to Mr Johnson as London Mayor, when he championed a failed plan to build a Thames estuary airport nicknamed Boris Island. The ex-merchant banker and diplomat was ennobled in  alongside several others from the PMaposs City Hall days.He recently went on a bizarre Twitter rant, describing Yorkshire as a county of leftist whingers.His outburst came after the Yorkshire Post reported the governmentaposs levelling up plans were failing to deliver. Posting the front page of the paperaposs weekend edition, the former deputy leader of Kensington and Cha Council said: I’m going to Yorkshire for a short break next week. Everything I’ve read recently in @yorkshirepost makes me fear I’m going to find it transformed into a county of leftist whingers begging for handouts. Let’s hope that’s not the case. Charles Moore  Among those given a peerage in summer  by Boris Johnson was his former boss. Charles Moore, previously said his role at the Dailywas a nightmare because the future PM was always terribly late with his copy. In November  he was at a dinner in London to which the Prime Minister rushed back in a jet from the COP climate summit in Glasgow. Lord Moore has described himself of a climate change sceptic and criticised the repressive hostility from policy elites in an article for thein October. At around the same time, Lord Moore wrote a piece complaining about the “hounding” of Tory MP Owen Paterson, who an inquiry found had breached standards rules. A short time after the dinner, Boris Johnson tried to change Commons rules to save Mr Paterson - leading to outrage and weeks of sleaze headlines. Edward Lister  Another long-time City Hall ally, Eddie Lister was handed a peerage by Boris Johnson in autumn . The -year-old led Tory Wandsworth Council for nearly  years and served as an adviser to Mr Johnson when he was London Mayor.He was brought into No when when Mr Johnson became PM in July  and became acting chief of staff after the dramatic departure of Dominic Cummings in November . Lord Udny-Lister left Government in April .He apologised last year for approving a £million taxpayer-backed loan to a big property developer he was being paid to advise. Geoffrey Cox  Top Conservative Geoffrey Cox – one of Parliament’s biggest earners outside Westminster – was made a Sir in New Year Honours under Boris Johnson. Sir Geoffrey gave up his work as a top-earning QC on being appointed to Cabinet in  - which had previously made him Westminster’s highest paid MP. He vehemently defended Boris Johnson in the Brexit wars and his attacks on the “dead parliament” he inherited from Theresa May. But he later ran into controversy in  when he advised Boris Johnsonaposs government that it was legal to prorogue Parliament - which was later found to be unlawful by the Supreme Court. Sir Geoffrey made headlines in  when it emerged he had tried to claim p for milk before his demand was knocked back by the Parliamentary expenses watchdog. The same year he stood down as the chair of Westminster’s cross-party standards committee, after failing to declare more than £, in outside earnings. He was later ordered to apologise in the Commons for failing to declare the sum within the -day time period. Last year he was embroiled in a second jobs row over his role advising the government of the British Virgin Islands. Tony Gallagher  The multi-millionaire property developer and Tory donor who hosted David Cameronaposs th birthday party was knighted in autumn . He entertained the former Prime Minister at Sarsden House, a listed th-Century Oxfordshire mansion set in  acres which Sir Tony bought for £million in . The entrepreneur is said to be part of the so-called Chipping Norton set centred around the pretty Cotswolds town in the former Tory leaderaposs old Oxfordshire constituency. The two men reportedly came to know one another when Mr Cameron became the local MP and since  Mr Gallagher has donated more than £, to the Conservatives. In , Boris Johnson registered a gt from Mr Gallagher of a sterling silver envelope worth £ following the birth of his son Wilfred. Downing Street said later that the present had been entered on the parliamentary register in error and was being removed as the PM had opted toit. Claire Fox  The former Brexit Party MEP was handed a seat in the Lords in . Once a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, she was criticised for the groupaposs refusal to condemn the  IRA bombings in Warrington. In  she tweeted in praise of the Liberal Democrats for not taking up peerages - only five years before she joined the House of Lords. Ian Botham  The former England cricketer was given a peerage by Boris Johnson as he marked his first anniversary in No . Lord Botham was reportedly rewarded for his support for Brexit among a list of Eurosceptic loyalists honoured by the PM.He was a high-profile figure pushing for Brexit, branding the EU corrupt and a racket and saying in : Cricket is a game where you achieve the greatest success when you are confident in your own ability to go out and stand proud. Britain has that spirit.He was named as the UKaposs trade envoy to Australia last year.

The Government has bowed to pressure on its slow humanitarian efforts to help Ukrainian refugees and have planned to launch an online visa application system from Tuesday.Western officials, and even the Prime Minister have expressed their grown concerns that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. And Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, who has faced a number of assassination attempts, has said he is no longer pressing for Nato membership for Ukraine but made a historic address in the House of Commons. While the Prime Ministeraposs ratings have slightly recovered since the Mirror first published stories on Downing Street lockdown parties, the Government appear to have used the crisis as a time to announce a number of controversial decisions.Here are five things the Tories have snuck out or have been forced to reveal since Russia invaded Ukraine....  Gavin Williamsonaposs knighthoodGavin Williamson, the gaffe-prone Tory who presided over the Covid exams chaos and was sacked by Theresa May as Defence Secretary, was handed the top gong, No confirmed.Ex-No chief of staff Gavin Barwell also claimed last year that Mr Williamson had vowed to unleash “the world’s biggest s**tshow” on the Government when he was fighting for his job as Defence Secretary in . Mr Williamson was sacked as Education Secretary in Boris Johnsonaposs last reshuffle after coming under intense criticism over his handling of the education brief during the pandemic.He came under fire for the  exams chaos and repeated U-turns over free school meals policy, which saw the Government shamed into feeding children over the holidays by footballer Marcus Rashford. He then hit the headlines in September by confusing Rashford with another black sportsman, the rugby player Maro Itoje.  Graduates to pay £, more after student loan shake-upPoorer graduates face paying £, more over their letimes under a major Tory shake-up of student loans. The Institute for Fiscal Studieswarned that Brits on below average incomes would lose out on a higher chunk of their earnings due to changes to student finance rules. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . This means some people will still be making repayments into their s. The IFS believes those on lower middle incomes will pay back £, more after revising its estimates in line with inflation rather than average earnings. The reforms would mean that more than halfof students who take out a loan would repay this in full, compared to % currently estimated. Tuition fees will be capped at £, for a further two years, while student loan interest rates will be set no higher than the rate of inflation from  . But the Government quietly rejected the reportaposs key call to slash tuition fees to £,-a-year.  Covid inquiry - terms of reference The Government has finally published its draft terms of reference for the public inquiry into their handling of the Covid pandemic. Boris Johnson announced an inquiry last year after fury at his slow decisions to lock down, which scientists believe cost lives.Retired judge Lady Hallett is set to examine the public health response, how decisions were made, the economic response including the furlough scheme, the procurement of personal protective equipment and even the closure of schools.But the draft Terms of Reference do not name Boris Johnson or promise to look at the inidual behaviour of the Prime Minister. That could come as a blow to bereaved families after ex-aide Dominic Cummings accused him of a litany of failings. Becky Kummer, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: “The inquiry is a one off and historic opportunity for the terrible suffering and loss of the past two years to be learned from, to ensure these tragedies are not repeated in the future.“The Government finally publishing the draft Terms of Reference is a huge step forward, and we look forward to feeding into the consultation on them. “Sadly, today’s announcement comes far too late. We will never know how many lives could have been saved had the Government had a rapid review phase in Summer , as we called for at the time.  Teachers pay Government proposals to hike salaries for experienced teachers by % in   and % the next year would amount to a pay cut for most staff, teaching unions said.The plans, set out in the official response to the pay review body, would also see new teachers salaries boosted to £,-a-year by  , in line with a Tory manesto commitment.But the union leaders warned that the plans amounted to another signicant real-terms pay cut for most teachers once inflation rates are taken into account.Brits are facing a spiralling cost of living crisis, with inflation rising to .% in January.Public sector pay rises were put on hold in   for all staff except NHS workers and those who earned less than £, due to heavy borrowing during the pandemic. Unused PPE bought during Covid will be burnedThe Government is planning to burn mountains of unusable personal protective equipment bought during the Covid pandemic, MPs have been told.A top Department of Health official said the plan was designed to find somefor . billion pieces of faulty or low quality kit that the NHS cannot use. Around £. billion spent by the Government on useless protective gear was written off by the Government, accounts for   revealed last month.Some £ million worth of equipment was found to be totally unusable, and £ million was spent on items that were not used before their expiry date. Officials are now planning to ship off around , pallets of wasted PPE to power plants to burn each month - around  lorryloads of kit. Rishi Sunak - Partygate questionnaireRishi Sunak joined the list of more than  people to receive a questionnaire from the Met Police to explain any involvement in gatherings at Downing Street.It’s understood the Chancellor received the form, which needed to be ed within seven days as requested by Scotland Yard. The Met is looking into  alleged gatherings held across Whitehall and Downing Street during lockdown rules under Operation Hillman.Mr Sunak previously confirmed he was at Boris Johnson ’s birthday do, held by No staff and the PM’s we Carrie on June , . But he insisted he had been present at the Cabinet Room for a routine meeting to discuss Covid. Earlier this month, he appeared to suggest he was not expecting to receive a form to complete. Asked on Sky News earlier this monthhe expected to receive a form, he replied: No... well, I donapost know.

Brendan Wyatt, who owns Liverpool clothing store Transalpino, had no experience of the aid industry, but after seeing the harrowing scenes of fleeing women and children, and our ­government’s pitul response to it, he couldn’t just sit back and watch. He left last weekend with his mate Robin Grime and Rado Chmiel, a Pole living in Liverpool, as interpreter. When they reached Rzeszow close to the Ukraine border, they went to a Macro store and filled a hired van full of food, blankets, nappies, sanitary towels, kids’ shoes and toys bought with the £, they had raised en route.  They then drove to a refuge centre and handed the much-needed supplies over to  grateful and humbled women and children. When I asked Brendan why he made the trip, he answered “because I could”. He is just one of countless British citizens, moved by the haunting plight of desperate Ukrainians, doing their bit to help, whether giving money, volunteering with charities or heading there to fight. But while we’re witnessing sacrice, generosity and action from below, at the top we’re seeing coldness, indference and mental torture by bureaucracy. Krzysztof Mikucki, a builder who drove from Mansfield to the Romanian border to pick up his Ukrainian we and her mother, and drive them back to safety in Britain, was one of hundreds held up for hours by UK Border Force staff at Calais and eventually told to go to Brussels or Paris to apply for a visa. “They treated us worse than the water in the toilet,” he said, angrily.  Refugees who have tried to come here to escape Putin’s genocide speak of our government treating them like criminals. And sadly they are spot-on. Because the Home Office’s lamentable excuse for not acting in the same humane manner as virtually every other European nation and greeting them with open arms is that we have to be sure these people are not spies or terrorists. Even though they are distraught women and children who have been battered out of their homes and are now battered with red tape to keep them out of the UK.How did we reach the point where the greeting from a once-compassionate country to ­families ­travelling , miles to fleethe worst nightmare imaginable is a taped-up piece of A paper on a Calais hostel window sending them back  miles to Paris or ­Brussels How was there no one in authority ­apologising and explaining what was going on, despite this ­effectively being the UK border with Europe   Meanwhile, in the Commons, the liar-in-chief and his immigrant-hating sidekicks shed ­crocodile tears and talk about Britain having an unparalleled tradition for welcoming refugees. Well we did before electing a government primarily on a ticket to shut our borders to outsiders. And whatever schemes they now come up with to distract from their initial response to the victims of Putin’s obscene war, these Tories have shamed Britain into looking small, insular, mean, nasty and cruel. Even though so many of its people are the polar opposite.

Nadhim Zahawi, who fled to Britain as a child from Iraq, said plans were being drawn up to welcome children fleeing the Russian invasion.He said auto-translate software was being rolled out on online learning hub Oak National Academy to help pupils who speak Russian or Ukrainian. Pupils will be able to access quizzes, video lessons with translated subtitles and worksheets. The UK Government has been under intense pressure to do more to help Ukrainians fleeing the brutal conflict after the visa process descended into chaos.  Ukrainians with family ties to Britain can apply for visas but families have reported delays and excessive bureaucracy - with some arriving in Calais only to be sent to visa centres in Brussels or Paris. The Government is expected to set out further details on a separate sponsorship route on Monday, where Brits will be able to host refugees in their own homes. Speaking at the Association of School and College Leadersconference, Mr Zahawi said: We will continue to support Ukrainians in any way we can. I know schools are doing what they can to support their students make sense of what they are seeing. And we are working with schools to ensure that the tens of thousands of Ukrainian children we will welcome to our shores will have a place in our education system. A team in the Department for Education is already making plans for a capacity of , children that we will take into our schools, he said but did not give further details. Mr Zahawi added: The family reunion route will be a couple of hundred thousand people coming through and then the humanitarian route which Michael Gove will outline in the next few days, will be uncapped.He branded the Russian aggression as barbaric, criminal invasion of their sovereign democratic country and said it was almost impossible to imagine the horror of what they are going through.

He spoke out during a visit to Birmingham Children’s Hospital today when he was asked whether he intended to bring forward a fourth booster shot. He said: When it comes to vaccinations and any future vaccinations, we listen carefully to what our expert advisers have to say in the JCVI. They have said recently... that certainly for groups of people, the over-s, immunosuppressed, those in residential care homes, they will receive a second booster shot... a fourth dose, and that will begin in the coming weeks.  We are preparing for that, and that will be recommended for those that have had at least a six-month gap between that dose and their previous one. When pushed further, he added: We keep it under review, but the right thing to do is to listen to the expert advice... Iaposm very confident with our approach. In February last month, Mr Javid said that the most vulnerable and at risk groups would receive a fourth dose in coming weeks. This was to help ensure they maintained a high-enough level of protection against the deadly virus.  Those who are eligible will be offered the jab around six months after their last dose. The latest figures have shown that, for the first time since the end of January, all four home nations have seen week-on-week spikes in infections.Figures published by the ONS infection survey show that, across the UK as a whole, . million people were estimated to have coronavirus last week. That number stood at . million at the start of the year, however this is a rise from . million.Mr Javid said the Government was continuing to monitor the situation very carefully in response to a rise in Covid- infections among the elderly and in childrenaposs hospitals.Obviously we monitor the situation regularly, we keep it under review, but at this stage things are very steady as we learn to live with Covid, he said. It does underline the importance of the defences we have built. Getting vaccinated, particularlyyou havenapost been vaccinated already, is very important. Whilst itaposs great to see, when it comes to the boosters, eight out of  adults have had their booster shots, those two out of  that have not yet come forward - itaposs still a very good time to come forward.

Currently, more than , English secondary schools employ A level teachers without the qualications to teach Music and Drama at that level subjects that are widely considered accessible for the privileged few. Bridget Phillipson, in her debut speech as Shadow Education Secretary, is expected to back parentsapos priorities, and give every child a rounded, fulfilling education on all subjects - including creative ones. She will reject “ choices” between prioritising academic and creative education, arguing that creativity, collaboration and problem solving promoted through sport and drama are as essential to the skills and jobs of the future. Ms Phillipson will say in Birmingham: As children grow up … school becomes more, not less, narrow. And that narrowing turns too many young people off learning which is a problem for their future and all of our futures.  We must retain the breadth. “I make no apology for being determined to see young people achieve academically, and just as important I want to see them thrive in le. It comes after former Schools Minister Nick Gibb revealed  state schools did not employ an A Level music teacher with such qualications and , with the relevant drama qualications. Creative subjects have seen huge declines in teacher numbers, with drama and music seeing declines of around %, according to official data. Ms Phillipson will add: “Knowledge is essential, but so is the ability to apply that rich knowledge to the real world, ensuring young people learn communication, collaboration and problem solving skills, and understand the dference they can make.“That is why Keir Starmer has announced Labour ’s Council of Skills Advisors to support us in ensuring every young person receives a rounded education that instils a love of learning and equips them with the skills they need for work and for le.” Labour has vowed to recruit , new teachers as part of its national excellence programme. Under a decade of Conservative government rule, fewer British kids choose to pursue creative subjects at GCSE like Music and Drama. The number of youngsters taking Drama and Music subjects at GCSE has slumped by more than % from  , to   with , taking the subjects last year. With more teachers, the party believes it can tackle the shortage of teachers which leaves some schools without the expertise to give every child a rounded, fulfilling education.The Shadow Education Secretaryaposs speech comes as data from the Institute for Public Policy Research, shows parents are increasingly prioritising their children’s enjoyment of learning and understanding of the world around them. Londonaposs prestigious Royal Academy of Music has previously revealed less than half of its pupils starting undergraduate degrees came from state schools in . The UKaposs top violinist Nigel Kennedy once vowed to drum out elitism within music education as he feared the subject had only become accessible to the privileged few. For me, the cause of this dumbing down is a natural rebellion against the ill-informed classical music administrators who consciously encourage exclusivity, refusing to embrace those outside their spectacularly precious world, he said.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyJess PhillipsEducationSchoolsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

New figures show ministers have sold off  court buildings out of  since the Tories came to power in  as part of cost cutting measures. Yet because of the pandemic magistrates courts are taking nearly three months to hear cases and the crown court backlog will not be cleared until . Shadow Justice Secretary Steve Reed said: “This soft-on-crime Conservative Government have brought about record delays in our courts because of these short-sighted selloffs. “Victims are waiting years for their day in court while criminals aren’t brought to justice. The Conservatives are letting criminals off and letting victims down.”  As buildings were sold cases were switched to nearby courts, though critics say this has increased journey times and makes it dficult for single mums and the disabled to get there. The courts went to private buyers, property developers and local authorities Rochdale court was sold for £, to the trustees of a mosque and London’s Bow County Court for £.million to an evangelical mission. The Ministry of Justice says the courts closed were underused and £million from sales have been reinvested to introduce new technology and online services.Justice minister James Cartlidge added: “The decision to close any court is not taken lightly. “It only happens following full public consultation and only when effective access to justice can be maintained.” But former Justice Secretary Robert Buckland blamed delays in hearing cases on budget cuts as well as Covid. Extra Nightingale courts were introduced during the pandemic to increase the capacity.

Your home has been bombed, you have just lost everything and you’re carrying the few possession you have left in a plastic bag. You know generous Brits want to welcome you to the safety of our shores. But first you have to navigate the bureaucracy. Currently to get here you have to fill in a complex visa application form. A friend of mine did it on behalf of a Ukrainian refugee and it took her three hours. My friend is intelligent, British, so a native English speaker, and has not just been frightened out of her wits by a Russian invasion. Yet even she struggled. While I welcome the decision to allow holders of Ukrainian passports to apply online for a visa without having to submit biometrics, surely this week the Home Office must announce plans to make it much easier Ukrainians without a biometric passport will still have to travel to a Visa Application Centre to submit fingerprints and we have seen the chaos at these centres where few appointments are available. A single online application for a whole family, rather than each inidual, would make the process both easier and more efficient. And it would be kinder to children. We should be issuing visas as quickly as possible, not putting obstacles in the way of getting people to safety.. You simply cannot run an ordinary immigration system in such extraordinary times.

Sharon Sutila, , is a mum-of-two with a sixth sense for when people are telling porkies - something she claims to have learned from raising -year-old Marissa and -year-old Tesla. Now the CEO of Cluso Investigation, which she founded in , Sharon puts her super sleuth skills to work uncovering secrets people would rather keep buried. Sharon, who describes herself as a human lie detector, says her kids donapost even bother lying to her anymore, as they know theyaposll get caught. The mum from the US state of Delaware said: My skillset means I stay as neutral as I can, evenI don’t trust what they are telling me. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here I don’t call them out, I try to stay cool and find outthey are telling me the truth, but I always find out. They are aware of that, so they have grown up knowing it is always better to tell the truth. If theyaposve ever told me they don’t have homework when they do, they know I will find out about it.She described an incident when Marissa was little and she tried to conceal a mark sheaposd made in the house from her mum. Sharon says she not only found out about the mark, but also went as far as showing her daughter the New York state laws to let her know lying has consequences. She said: I think it scared her to death!  The mum reckons she honed her detective skills when she was just  years old and channelled her favourite literary characters, Sherlock Holmes and Nancy Drew. After a classroom bully smashed her favourite record and wrote her a nasty note, Sharon was determined to expose them to her teacher. She found out who the culprit was by comparing their handwriting to the homework of her peers. After graduating from university in , Sharon shunned the family business in fishing and seafood to embark upon a career in tech for IBM. There, she realised she could use her coding skills to suss out new potential employees - and she pointed out those who werenapost telling the truth on their CVs.  People had put degrees that they had never taken and qualications that they never had, she said. And when her bosses discovered her skills, she became an integral part of the companyaposs international operation. Sharon said: I wanted to know more about the person, or I couldn’t be sure they weren’t lying to me. I absolutely love research, figuring things out and problem solving. I like challenges. Now working as a private investigator, Sharon says sheaposs skilled at finding out things about people from the comfort of her own home - as long as she has a computer. She said: I mostly work on allowing people to tell me what they want to tell me first. And I’ll try to seethey are being honest.  While Sharon enjoys her work, sheaposs had to put up with her fair share of threats from people who sheaposs exposed. She said: I have been threatened. A man told me he was going to come into my house. But I’m not going to let someone stop me from doing my job just because they are being aggressive. I’m not going to stop what I do because of a threat. Sharon has now penned a novel based on some of her experiences working in a male-dominated industry, called The Healing. She said: Championing equality for women is my lelong passion. Challenging gender bias and the stereotyping of women is critically important to combat the issue. I wrote my book by starting my character with a lot of my own background. I grew up in the same time frame as the book and went through the very same gender norms, which can mean women canapost do or achieve certain things. In the book, the character starts in the same way I did - being told I couldnapost follow my own path. And she is trying to find her purpose in the world.

If people who start to over-explain situations - the truth is often much simpler. . If someone is immediately defensive or turns to anger when they are asked a question. .

But they have put out an urgent plea for help to find a new home, close to Lancashire, for their family - as their isolated location has become uninhabitable. DAS Dalmatians is currently based just outside Newton Abbott, Devon - or the middle of nowhere, as they describe it.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.The property gets flooded every time it rains, and the roads are so bad that emergency services cannot reach it, reports the LiverpoolEcho.Sue said: We live in a stable that is down a bridleway. No one will deliver anything.aposaposA few weeks ago we had an electrical fire, and we were very lucky that Dave and I were awake otherwise who knows what could have happened.aposaposThe couple were forced to stop taking in new dogs last month due to the state of their premises. But they want to keep to continue on their mission to help dalmatians, so they are now appealing for dog-friendly potential landlords to get in touch. The couple currently live in a triple stable, with a kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom and a lounge - which is usually filled with dalmatians. And le with a pack of dogs is tough - as it means getting up before sunrise to let the dogs out into their field. Sue said: Biscuit likes to sing to us at .am every morning until one of us gets up and lets him onto our bed. Thankfully heaposs the only one that does that. The dogs donapost live in kennels or cages - instead lounging about on the beds and sofas around their converted stable home.  Dinnertime consists of shovelling out kg of dog biscuits every day, with Sue on hand to make sure every dog gets enough. Sue, a full-time dog mum, said: Le with these dogs is madness - but I wouldnapost have it any other way. You have to be dotty to have so many spotties. Iaposve always loved dogs but I love dalmatians because they are dferent. The first dog the couple helped was a six-month-old puppy who was being sold as part of a drug deal. Sue said: The poor little mite was very skinny, dirty and stunk of smoke. We have been asked to help more and more dogs over the years and have never wanted to stop. The couple rehome the dalmatians that are able to live a normal le after being assessed and rehabilitated but take in the kids that cannot be rehomed. She said: These pups stay with us forever being loved and having the best we can give them. We also help dogs that other rescues say no to. If a dog needs our help, I will do whatever I can do to helpwe have room but sadly at the moment, we can not help dogs that are threatened to be euthanised as we do not have room to keep them separated while being assessed.  The eldest of their dogs are Zakky and Zena, aged  who has been with Sue for two years. The pair are brother and sister whose owner died and left them on their own. Sue said: Zakky has a long bite history and bit Dave on meeting him - which can happen quite often with new problem kids. Zakky took a while to realise he didn’t have to bite anymore and now is one of the family and very loving. Zena now has dementia but still knows how to con her Dad into sharing his food with her. We stopped them from being separated - another rescue was going to split them up but they were  years old, it would have been awful for them to do that so they came here. They need to find a new home soon so they can take more dogs - and ideally, one that is in a more suitable location, more easily accessible for food deliveries and vet visits. Sue said: There are no kennels and as the dogs are free-range, they are very happy and don’t bark. Keeping them in a home environment is much better for their well-being. We live in a stable that is down a bridleway. No one will deliver anything. We are on the side of a valley, so every time it rains it floods us. The roof has holes in it so we are exposed to the elements. In summer it is so dusty - I get such bad chest infections. The road is so narrow and bumpy that emergency services are also unable to reach us. aposaposOn Sunday we had an electrical fire, and we were very lucky that Dave and I were awake otherwise who knows what could have happened.aposapos Sue continued: People donapost realise that the dogs are so quiet because they donapost live in kennels - they donapost make a noise. We have so many wonderful dogs that need our care, a huge mixture of ages - and we donapost want them to live in mud anymore.aposapos Sue and Dave, who run the sanctuary full-time, are ideally after a long term let, within a few hours drive of Morecambe Bay in a rural setting with at least an acre of land and a yard.You can donate to the sanctuary here.

Last week William, , won a High Court battle for a kidney transplant.And tonight his mother Amy McLellen thanked strangers who have offered to be donors. Amy said: “So many people have been touched by William’s story. They can see what a wonderful young man he is. We’ve had lots of people come forward in the hope that they are the crucial donor. “We are so thankful to everyone who has supported us throughout this horrendous ordeal.” As we revealed in November, a rare disease called FSGS has wrecked William’s kidneys. Doctors at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital ruled out a transplant because of complications – including his autism and ADHD – and recommended palliative care.  But a judge ruled that the young golf fanatic should have a transplant and continue dialysis. Amy, , of Newton, Lancs, added: “I especially want to thank the judge for taking the time to meet William. I feel that played a big part in the decision. “Being a parent of a child with a learning disability shouldn’t mean you have to fight for what is given to other children and adults.  “And just because a doctor is a professional doesn’t mean they are always right. “Parents know their children best.” Children with William’s condition usually live to around  but can get to  after a transplant.

Sam Jones, , from Denton, in Tameside, Greater Manchester, was found by his family in a cemetery on the evening of July  and was then rushed to hospital. However, he died three days later.The inquest into Samaposs death heard how he had been in touch with his mother at about pm to say he was planning on taking his own le. Sam refused to tell them where he was, but his family said aposthey knew right awayapos where he would be.The inquest, held at South Manchester Coroner’s Court in Stockport, heard his family knew that he would be at a nearby cemetery where his grandmother was buried and, when Samaposs dad Chris got there, he found his son considering ending his le.Emergency services were also called as Samaposs dad and brother tried to help him, reports the MEN. The heartbroken dad told the coroner: I begged him not to do it. Sam was initially taken to Tameside Hospital, and later referred to the critical care unit at Manchester Royal Infirmary. On July , Sam’s condition continued to deteriorate further and he was sadly pronounced dead on July . Senior coroner Alison Mutch, told Sam’s family: “I have to say how you managed to do all of that under those circumstances says a lot about your commitment to try and do the best for him. I understand it must have been a very dficult situation for everyone.” If you are affected by this story there are many people who would be happy to talk to you: Samaritans If you need to talk and donapost know where to turn to, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

The coroner added: “It’s a tribute to your brevity as a family that even in his darkest hours, you were keen to follow your son’s wishes to ensure his organs were donated to give others le evenhe couldn’t live. Of course, it doesn’t bring him back but I hope it served as a small comfort at a very dficult time of grief.” The court heard how Sam joined Oasis Academy Leesbrook in Oldham in  as a P.E. teacher but also regularly taught science and maths.  The school described him as an ‘exceptional and gted teacher’ who was ‘valued and respected’ by staff, students and their parents. Sam later became an assistant deputy at the academy and had been ‘instrumental’ in developing the school’s culture. Describing his son as a keen footballer, Mr Jones said his family were ‘incredibly proud’ of him. “He had a great love for sport,” he told the court. “He was so competitive - being second was not something he would ever accept. He played semi-pro football and played for a number of local teams including Wythenshawe Town FC. “Up to , he was an excellent goalkeeper. Two or three professional clubs even wanted to sign him as a goalkeeper but unfortunately he had lost a love for it. He wanted glory, he wanted to be scoring goals. “He was the first one in the family to ever go to university. It cost mum and dad a lot of money and he went twice.

The inquest heard how there had been nothing in Sam’s medical records to indicate he had expressed any concerns with his mental health or had similar thoughts in the past. “Before this, there had been no inkling that this was going to happen to your son and was completely out of character,” Ms Mutch said. It was out of the blue for someone with such a promising career, Ms Mutch said. No notes were found and nothing suspicious was noted in a toxicology report or police investigation.The coroner said she was unable to rule Sam’s death as suicide as there was no clear evidence to suggest he had fully understood the severity of his actions. His death was therefore ruled as the consequence of self-asphyxiation. Addressing Sam’s family upon making the conclusion, Ms Mutch said: “You obviously loved him very much and wanted to support him as much as possible. You were very close to him and wanted to make sure he had the best and most supportive environment. “That level of support is shown on the day when Sam was found. As a mother, I’m sure that is a conversation that will be impossible to forget. “You absolutely did the right thing straight away and I think it shows just how well you knew your son that you knew he would be at the cemetery.” Ms Mutch added: “I can’t imagine this is something you’re ever going to be able to forget. It sounds asyou did everything you could to stop what happened, but unfortunately, notwithstanding your pleas to him, the damage had already been done. “Those must have been very dark and dficult days for you all.” The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

It forced Kate to apologise for not wearing a pretty dress in a very cute exchange. Instead of a glitzy gown, Kate opted for a Hobbs coat, Zara dress and an eye-catching Beulah London scarf. Rhian explained at the time: My daughter loves fairy tales and Cinderella, and she was really excited to meet a real princess. Kate said aposIaposm really sorry Iaposm not wearing a pretty dress todayapos and Annabel said: aposI thought youaposd look like Cinderellaapos.

Buckingham Palace confirmed last month that they would be travelling to the Caribbean for a week-long trip to help mark the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee. The tour starts on Saturday, March  and will take in Belize, Jamaica and The Bahamas before ending on March . Kensington Palace said William and Kate will visit historic Mayan sites and celebrate the rich culture of the Garuna community in Belize, as well as explore the country’s bioersity. In Jamaica, they will meet with the Jamaican Defence Force and celebrate the legacy of Bob Marley and other groundbreaking Jamaican musicians alongside potential stars of the future. In the Bahamas, the Cambridges will visit a number of islands and experience a world-famous junkanoo parade.A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said: “Their Royal Highnesses are very much looking forward to the visit, which will be their first joint official overseas tour since the onset of Covid- in .”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince WilliamRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Brits are being clobbered by rocketing energy bills, rising inflation and hikes to national insurance from April, while itaposs forecasted that the cost of essential foods such as bread, potatoes and pasta is likely to rise by between % and % over the coming months. According to a think-tank, every UK household could soon be £, worse off due to the rising costs.Now, people living in Huddersfield have admitted they are taking drastic measures in order to save money, with one woman even claiming that some families are struggling to feed their children, Yorkshire Live reports. Anne Wilkinson, who was shopping at Leeds Road retail park, said her and her husband, who are both retired, are having to be more cautious about what we use.  We are not travelling as much as we would have done in the past , she said. My son lives over in Manchester and when we want to go and see him it is going to be a lot more expensive. We are not absolutely sure what other things might affect us until we get the bills in - there is some uncertainty. I am not surethings like council tax will go up. Anne added she is in a fortunate position but said her previous work as a foster carer means she knows many families who are struggling. A lot of families have no food in the house or electricity because they dare not turn things on. Some people are struggling to feed their children. It makes you cross because you think to yourself: aposIs it all absolutely necessaryapos   Mrs Greaves, who did not want to give her first name, lives in Springbank Road, which falls within an area recently named the second-most deprived in Huddersfield. The mum admitted that she has started to batch cook in order to minimise the number of times she used her cooker. I started cooking for the next two days when I noticed the prices were going up, she said. That way, I do not have to stand over the cooker again because I have done it all in one day. I will cook on Saturday for that evening and also for Sunday so I am not doing two sets of dishes. Once I have cooked, everything is switched off - thataposs it. Then I only have to use the microwave to warm it up . The mum continued: My central heating is on a timer and I do not have a gas fire. The only thing I use everyday is my washing machine.My house insurance has gone up as well, but it is the gas and electric that is the killer. I think that is what is hitting everyoneaposs pockets. With experts forecasting costs may rise further, Mrs Greaves added that it could result in increased levels of crime in the area. Some people canapost eat, she said. I can see more break-ins this year. Some people do not know how they are going to manage. When winter hits them, I think people will be in even more poverty. Sadia Rana, who has lived in Springbank Crescent for  years, said that her bills had risen for WiFi, gas and electric. I cannot say le is aposnormalapos because I have less savings, she said. I am paying more than normal so it means I canapost spend on other things. I think prices will rise again. My son is always watching the news before bed and there are reports every day that prices are going up.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have decided their future is not in the UK, while Prince Andrew is not expected to everto public le.But the enforced alterations donapost begin to scratch the surface of whataposs ahead, some believe.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  Charles has long been prepping for the new era and he has Palace hangers-on firmly in his eye-line. It has long been said that the -year-old plans a major shake-up of the when he becomes head of state - and it could also affect royal residences. It remains to be seen which members of the family will be trimmed but analyst Jonathan Sacerdoti told the Mirrror things are about to become very modern.He said: I think when Charles takes to the throne we will see the emphasis put on those who command absolute respect.  The demands of responsibility and certain behaviours that are needed will be at the forefront - simply, you must be totally reliable. It is well known that Charles wants to stamp his mark and in modern times, donapost be surprised to see changes made. It will be a very handy way to respond to the recent controversies, such as Prince Andrew, as well as Prince Harryaposs attacks on the family. The core will be there, and Prince George will join in time - I think that is clear.  But it’s always been speculated that Charles, when he eventually takes over, will want to slim down the working royals at the heart of the family. It will be about commanding respect. I think he is looking forward to being King. It is not simply a change of personnel thataposs ahead of us. Senior royals are acutely aware of the requirement to prove they are value for money and the weight of this responsibility has weighed heavily on the Prince of Wales.  Opening of Buckingham Palace to the public is one idea that the future king is said to be keen to explore. Thereaposs a sense that he wants a slimmed down monarchy to make sure that everybody is doing their bit and [there are] no so-called hangers-on, royal expert Camilla Tominey said. “It does make the future of the monarchy kind of uncertain. “We’ve had this model that the Queen has been at the head of for all of this time, because she’s obviously been on the throne for nearly seven decades.”“That means by association that you’re going to have fewer royals taking on fewer patronages, and then what does that mean for the charities ” she told The ’s Royal Insight podcast.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Buckingham PalacePrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Will you be sad to see Harry miss the memorial  Have your say in the comment section He said he would feel unsafe bringing his two children Archie, two, and Lilibet, nine months, over to the UK. Experts previously claimed Harry would have been given aposadequateapos protection for the March  event in Westminster Abbey, and during his stay in Windsor. Harry had said long ago he felt it was not safe to bring his we or children back to the country. Angela Levin, Harry’s biographer, told the Sun: “He has snubbed the Duke of Edinburgh but really he is snubbing the Queen.”  She said the Queen was still grieving the loss of Philip, her husband of  years, and suggested Harry may well use the same reasoning to avoid attending his grandmotheraposs Platinum Jubilee celebration as well. She went on: “He has got this all wrong. If he comes over for a royal event he gets police protection. What they won’t do is,he goes out with his friends he gets security.” Harry has been back to the UK only twice since leaving for the US in  with we Meghan. He ed for Philip’s funeral last April only days after he told Oprah Winfrey of racist comments made by royal family members about his children, without revealing who he was referring to. Two months later he attended an unveiling of a statue of his mother, Princess Diana, at Kensington Palace.This comes as Buckingham Palace revealed today that the Queen would not be attending the Commonwealth Service on Monday.Instead, Prince Charles will be attending in her place.

Rosemarie, who asked for her surname to not be shared, moved into her flat in North London just over two years ago now and, within  days, the family had a heavy leak coming down through her kitchen ceiling.However, that was only the beginning of the issues the family was to experience at the Peabody housing association property in Muswell Hill, reports MyLondon. The single mum has also been having problems with the boiler, being left without hot water, and Rosemarie said her kids - aged seven and  - constantly complain about the water being too cold.Peabody housing association has apologised for the issues and says it is working to tackle the issues.  But in the meantime, Rosemarie claims things took a dramatic turn for the worse at the beginning of the year when her sonsapos bedroom was hit by flood damage. She said the damage resulted in them sleeping her in and the mum being forced to sleep on the floor. Rosemarie said: “First, the bathroom radiator wasn’t working. They came and they tried to fix it, but it still just comes on now and again. “The radiator in the kids’ bedroom is constantly leaking as well. With the hot water, when you put your hand under it, it’s warm. But seconds later when you put it on your body, it’s cold.The mum-of-two said the lack of hot water in the property has led to huge issues for the family and her sons struggle to wash properly before going to school. She said it’s extremely upsetting and her kids constantly complain about the water being too cold. Rosemarie also claimed the heating in her North London flat does not work properly. This is a huge issue, as she claims the back door to the property hasn’t been sealed properly, meaning the flat gets cold very quickly.  She added: “There’s such a big gap around it - they tried to patch it up but it didn’t work. I’ve got slugs coming through the gap. According to Rosemarie, the conditions in her flat took a dramatic turn on January , earlier this year when her sons’ bedroom was hit by devastating flood damage. Rosemarie explained that the flood damage “mashed up” everything in the room, including the childrenaposs beds, lights and their possessions.As a result, her two sons have been living without beds ever since and she has given them her bed to sleep in. Now, she has been forced to sleep on the floor. “I had to give up my bed - that room is completely out of use,” Rosemarie said. Rosemarie is a vulnerable tenant, with a long history of depression, anxiety and OCD.  She does not feel Peabody is taking her mental health considerations into account and said her living conditions have pushed her to a new low. Tearfully, Rosemarie said: “It’s long term, but since I moved to that property it’s been really bad. I’ve got days when I want to commit suicide. “As soon as I get home, there are days when I’ve wanted to take my own le.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

She said she has worked hard to make her home comfortable to live in, though the constant state of disrepair has made it almost impossible to go on living there. Rosemarie added: “I don’t want to move out, but with the conditions, I have to move. A spokesperson from the Peabody housing association said: We are very sorry about the ongoing issues with [Rosemarie’s] home and understand her concerns, which we’re trying to resolve.

Miss Wadsworth appeared before the General Teaching Council for Scotlandyesterday to face the claims, Glasgow Live reports. Support teacher Pamela Dougall gave evidence to the , and said she was left in tears after witnessing on the incidents. She said: I witnessed Miss Wadsworth dragging Pupil A back along the floor back to the classroom. Her [Pupil A] tummy was on the floor, she looked terried. I put my hands on my head and said aposyou canapost do thatapos. I asked Pupil Ashe was alright, she put her thumbs up as she is a non-verbal child. Pupil A has a mental age of roughly  to  months. I was in a state of shock, every time I saw Pupil A that day I cried.  She said: The working relationship with Miss Wadsworth was dficult. I got the feeling that she did not want anyone in the class. When I was working with Miss Wadsworth I felt I couldnapost do my job properly as she didnapost trust me. Another support teacher, Jacqueline Steele who was working in a class nearby, told the hearing : I was sitting at a table helping kids finish their work they hadnapost finished and I was looking directly out of the classroom door. I saw Pupil A running past the door.Pupil A stopped at the double doors [ fire exit].Mrs Wadsworth ran up and grabbed Pupil Aaposs arm in quite a forceful manner. Her tugging knocked Pupil A off her balance and she was walking too fast for her to keep up. I put my hands on my head. It was the first time I saw her look frightened. [When Mrs Steele entered Pupil Aaposs classroom] Pupil A was on the floor at the door, it was quite manic and Miss Wadsworth did not have any control of the class. For me it was a child protection issue. That afternoon Pupil A was not herself and was not smiling. You could seeshe looked sad, I was able to tell when she wasnapost happy. Further allegations have been lodged against the teacher such as grabbing the same pupil by the arm and pushing her back onto a chair. Miss Wadsworth also faces allegations that she grabbed another pupil by the shoulders which caused them distress. She has also been accused of leaving the pupils in her additional support needs class unattended.

Lynn Siner died aged  at her home on Boxing Day in  after a battle with cancer.The mum, from Huyton, Merseyside was told she had days to live in the October of that year but her daughter Ashleigh believes her mum was determined to spend one last Christmas with the family, reports Liverpool Echo.Lynn had been in Marie Curie Hospice in the weeks leading up to December , , but was allowed home on Christmas Eve to spend the festive period with her family. Ashleigh said it was a special time for her family and her mum also absolutely loved it. She said: My mum was always thinking of others before herself even though she was so ill, and she wanted to try and make Christmas as normal as possible. It was our tradition every year for myself, my mum and my brother to go to London at the beginning of December for the weekend.  My mum loved to go to Harrods and get her special presents from there. Obviously, she was too ill to go but she still wanted me to go and get everyone’s Christmas presents - she was ringing me from her bed at Marie Curie telling me what to buy from Harrods. “While she was staying at Marie Curie, we brought one of her Christmas trees in from home and decorated it and put all the presents we had bought underneath – we wanted her room to feel very homely. “Christmas was such a special time for our family as my mum absolutely loved it and looked forward to it all year. We enjoyed the build-up, doing Christmassy things and visiting the markets. Mum was too ill to go out to the Christmas markets, but Marie Curie had a special Christmas fayre in the hospice with stalls selling all types of things. All my family went along, and we really enjoyed it. It was perfect as it was all indoors, and we could easily push my mum in the wheelchair from her room and into the lt upstairs to visit the stalls.” Ashleigh added that her mum was allowed home on Christmas Eve, which meant the family could spend the night with eachother. We all stayed with mum on Christmas Eve and we opened our presents as normal on Christmas morning, Ashleigh said. After our Christmas lunch, my mum then fell asleep early afternoon and never really woke again apart from saying the odd sentences, and then she then passed away Boxing Day morning. I really do believe she got the strength to make sure she was there for the whole of Christmas Day. We were told in October that she only had days left to live but she fought on and I think once she was home, and saw us all together for one last Christmas, she was ready to go. Even though it was the worst time of our lives, we are so glad we got to spend that last Christmas together, and Marie Curie helped make that possible.” Lynn was a health care assistant at Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital and Ashleigh said due to this she trusted the doctors and nurses at Marie Curie and felt safe and secure at the hospice. Since Lynnaposs death, the family have raised raised thousands of pounds for Marie Curie. Ashleigh said: “At the funeral, we asked for donations to Marie Curie rather than flowers and after that, I thought that I’d like to do other things to raise money for the charity to give something back and do something for my mum and the whole family. “So, the first thing that we did was host charity night at a local social club with raffles, Irish Bingo and entertainment. We did a tombola too and got lots of prizes from dferent companies to auction for the raffle - it was amazing. We raised roughly £, from that event. “Then, when we took the money to Marie Curie and learnt about the Pay for a Day fundraising challenge where we could set ourselves the goal of raising enough money to pay to run the hospice for a whole day. So, we jumped at this and got on with planning our next event a charity walk. “It ended up being a fancy dress walk for family and friends mainly, starting at the Albert Dock and ending up at my mum’s house in Dovecot, where we had drinks to celebrate and toast mum. We walked over K and raised more than £,.” “We plan on doing more fundraising for Marie Curie in the future too.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ChristmasBoxing DayHarrods Inc.Love IslandCharitiesFuneralsHospitalsStock marketFancy dressChristmas treesChristmas partyCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer. “Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely and damage to trees possible. Some short term loss of power and other services is possible. It’s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and or large waves.” Then more widespread yellow warnings are also in place for Sunday with similar advice to expect travel disruption. BBC weather forecaster Tomasz Schafernaker warned people that as well as the strong wind people will need their umbrellas.“A lot of cloud and some rain across Scotland, parts of northern England, brighter across the rest of England and Wales, and in fact some decent sunny spells through the middle of the afternoon and I think the best of the weather will be the further east you go, he said, looking at Saturday.  But notice this curl of rain here, this is a low pressure that is swinging into the south west of the UK. Not only rain but some very strong winds, we are talking of gusts of mph, mph and maybe even mph so it is really going to be quite stormy around some of the coasts.” Mr Schafernaker said it is not widespread but advised people in the South West to take care. Then on Sunday the strong winds will cover the country with the weather impacted by a low pressure system by the west of Scotland. Very gusty winds right across the country, we are talking mph, mph or maybe mph around some exposed coasts … on Sunday it will be blustery right across the UK. Temperatures on Sunday typically between C and C so not as mild as it has been but mild enough, said Mr Schafernaker.  Looking ahead to next week and people can expect spring-like temperatures especially in the south. Monday a much better day, the winds will be lighter there will be some sunshine around, still some showers around northern parts of the country but in the south it really is an improving picture and that’s how it is going to be over the next few days into next week, said Mr Schafernaker. In fact in the south of the country temperatures could peak around C or C. So a mixed weekend but better the week ahead.” UK forecast for the next  days Turning wet and windy in the Southwest this afternoon. Today: Sunny spells and showers this morning, with parts of Scotland seeing some more persistent rain. Showers fading for many this afternoon when wet and windy weather with heavy rain coastal gales develops over southwest England and southwest Wales. Tonight: Early evening rain in the southwest moves slowly northeastwards to extend from western Scotland into northwest England, the Midlands and southern England by dawn. Windy, with gales in the west. Sunday: Early rain over parts of Scotland and England clears eastwards, clearing the far east late afternoon. Otherwise, sunny spells and showers. Windy with coastal gales in the north and west. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Occasionally unsettled across northern and western areas, with spells of rain and strong winds. Generally drier where, with some mist and fog overnight, before some rain develops Wednesday.

The odd, reclusive President has an intense daily schedule - and tries to keep intrusions into his personal le strictly limited.Putin married Lyudmila Shkrebneva in  and the couple had two daughters, Mariya and Yekaterina. Although he is notoriously secretive about his personal le, the couple announced their separation in a staged television interview in June . The orce was later confirmed by Lyudmilaaposs name being removed from Putinaposs official biography on the Kremlin website, so his biography simply mentions their children instead. In his  biography aposFirst Personapos, which contains a series of interviews with the Russian president and figures close to him, Lyudmila shared details of their relationship. In a frank chat, she revealed that she didnapost think much of the poorly dressed man she met outside a theatre while on a double date.Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blog But the pair continued to keep in touch after Putin gave her his phone number - a rare move for the privacy-obsessed KGB officer. After three-and-a-half years, Putin proposed, but his subdued manner left Lyudmila convinced he was actually trying to dump her. She took the interviewee: One night we were sitting this house and he said, You know what kind of person I am by now. In general, Iaposm not very easygoing. He was being self-critical. He explained that he was the silent type that he was rather abrupt in some things and he could even insult people, and so on. He was saying that he was a risky le partner. And he added: In three and a half years, you have probably made up your mind. It sounded to me like we were breaking up. aposYes, Iaposve made up my mind,apos I said.

The letter, which was published today, says the pandemic is not over and that the approach to vaccine equity is immoral, entirely self-defeating and also an ethical, economic and epidemiological failure.It says: The European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland continue to block the lting of intellectual property rules which would enable the redistribution and scale-up of Covid- vaccines, test and treatment manufacturing in the global south. The transfer of largely publicly funded vaccine technology and know-how from pharmaceutical corporations would fast track production to a matter of months. Yet still today, a handful of these corporations retain the power to dictate vaccine supply, distribution and price – and the power to decide who lives and who dies. World leaders, and particularly rich nations, have the responsibility to change this situation and ensure the publicly funded vaccine technology and know-how is available to the global south. The letter, which comes on the second anniversary of Covid- being declared a pandemic, is also signed by actress Charlize Theron, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Meanwhile, it was also revealed today that the coupleaposs Archewell Foundation has pledged its support to The Peopleaposs Vaccine Alliance - a non-profit organisation that wants everybody across the world to have access to Covid vaccine, tests and treatments. Itaposs unknown how much they have invested. Their investment in the campaign was announced today on The Peopleaposs Vaccine Alliance Twitter page, which said it was proud to welcome Meghan and Harryaposs support.The tweet said: We are proud to welcome Archewell Foundation to the Alliance and appreciate their support, alongside Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.We will work together to end vaccine inequity and ensure COVID- vaccines, treatments and tests are available to everyone.Both Harry and Meghan have spoken out about vaccine equity in the past and last May, Harry made an appearance at Vax Live - a concert in Calornia to promote the sharing of vaccines.The couple has also previously written an open letter to the chief executives of pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca urging them to redouble their support for the UN-sponsored Covax vaccine equity programme.And last September, during a mini-tour in New York City, the couple appeared at the at Global Citizen Live event in Central Park. During the event, Meghan said: “Every single person on this planet has a fundamental right to get this vaccine but thataposs not happening. “It is wrong that so much of the vaccine supply has only gone to just ten wealthy nations and not everyone , itaposs just not OK.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Using side-by-side pics, Hayley - who goes by the username @ hayleymadiganfitness - showed the dference between an Insta Pool Pose Vs What I see in the bathroom mirror, showing a posed pic next to what her bum looks like in reality.In a powerful caption, Hayley explained: Dferent poses, dferent camera angles, dferent posture, dferent lighting can all make a huge dference to how a body is perceived and more specically how you see your own body! You will see your body in all types of angles and poses. You will see your body relaxed and unposed. You will see yourself in many ways so do not let your eyes deceive you by telling you to feel negative towards your own body.  She continued: You have the power to change your mindset, to look at your own body in a kinder manner. To be kinder to yourself and to your mental health. To be kinder to your body, because it is your home and you only have one so treat it with the best kindness you can offer! We often pick holes in our bodies continuously but when you realise that no one worth having in your le wouldn’t ever pick those same holes about you is an important thing to remember. The people that care and love you do not see you the same way, all they see is the happiness, the love, and the sparkle that you bring to them and the world. You’re not just a body, you are YOU, so be kinder to yourself. Many people have been greatly touched by Hayleyaposs wise words, which are so very important in an age where le filtered through a social media lens can seriously impact the way we view our bodies.One person thanked Hayley for bringing some honesty to Instagram, really admire you for this, while another described her honesty as inspiring.A third person remarked that they wished such pics were shown in high schools, adding: I speak for myself around that age, I only saw the ‘perfect’ Instagram bodies. It’s easy to lose track of what is picture-perfect and what is real. I’d rather see everyday-perfect than picture-perfect more.

I stayed up all night anticipating him sneaking out again and lo and behold he did! I tracked his car and saw it go to an abandoned plot of land a whole -minute drive away. He stayed there for almost two hours and then came home. The woman spoke to her husband when he came home, and while she demanded to know what heaposd been up to, the man was furious that she had invaded his privacy.  She added: I confronted him about it and he got absolutely furious. I asked him why he was going there and he said that he was aposhandling his businessapos and I should aposmind mineapos and aposrespect his privacyapos. He packed a bag and has now been staying at his brother’s house for the last couple of nights. Reddit commenters have been split over the post, as many people believe both the woman and her husband are in the wrong for their actions - with several insisting communication could have solved most of their issues. One person said: Everybody sucks here. Him for the lying and sneaking around, you for the tracking device. When you get to the point of putting a tracking device on your spouseaposs car, itaposs time to either go to marriage counselling or a lawyer for a orce. While another added: If heaposs disappearing off at weird times you should be told where heaposs been. However, tracking someone is a**hole behaviour as well, youaposre both as bad in this scenario. He sucks for his lack of honesty, this sounds like some sort of shady deal to me. You suck for putting a tracker on him, thataposs disgusting behaviour also, a third stated. Appleaposs AirTags can be helpfulyouaposve misplaced your keys, but you shouldnapost worry about someone slipping one into your bag for malicious purposes, as according to Appleaposs website, the device is designed to discourage unwanted tracking. If someone aposs AirTag finds its way into your belongings, your iPhone will send you an alert to let you know itaposs travelling with you. Andyou canapost find the device, it will start playing a sound to help you locate it. However, this feature only kicks inan AirTag is separated from its owner, so you also donapost need to worryyouaposre travelling with a friend who has an AirTag.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditUmm what MarriageCheating\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The US embassy in Kyiv shared the clip of the tense meeting yesterday and it has since gone viral.The footage shows the three soldiers walking towards the Ukrainian couple aposs gated driveway before attempting to force entry. Eventually, the Russian soldiers manage to open the gate and walk into the property with their weapons drawn.Barking dogs can be heard in the background and then an elderly couple appears to confront the armed men. Shouting is heard before one of the soldiers fires his gun.  A fourth soldier then enters their property as the couple continues to scream, demanding they leave. The soldiers are eventually seen turning around and leaving. The couple are then seen walking them towards the gate before shutting it behind them.It is understood this happened in Mykolayiv Oblast, about  miles east of Odessa in southern Ukraine.The US Embassy Kyiv shared the footage alongside the caption: “Today we salute this elderly couple, who stood up to three Russian soldiers.”The tweet has received more than , likes since it was shared, together with more than , retweets. One person responded Amazing, well done and another one said That is so brave!. Iaposve never seen anything like that! Amazing people, wrote another social media user.This comes as Ukraine has accused Russian forces of abducting mayor of Melitopol Ivan Federov as they move to a new stage of terror. President Zelensky warned that Putin had moved to the next stage of his attack by kidnapping the mayor of the southeastern city. Adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, Anton Heraschenko, claimed  soldiers had sieged Melitopol’s crisis centre on Thursday, March , before putting a bag over Mr Federovaposs head.Ukraine officials have now shared CCTV footage which they claim shows the moment their colleague was kidnapped by Putinaposs men. The clip follows the moment a group of masked men lead another man from the building. But Moscow has not yet commented on the abduction claims. In an address on Friday, March , Ukraineaposs President Zelensky described his colleague as a mayor who bravely defends Ukraine and the members of his community. It comes as the sound of war continued to rip through Ukraine overnight with Russian troops edging closer to Ukraineaposs capital Kyiv. Earlier today, the UK Government was condemned by French president Emmanuel Macron for f ailing to live up to its “grand statements” on helping Ukrainian refugees.Speaking at the end of an EU summit in Versailles on Friday, Mr Macron reportedly criticised Britain’s visa policy which required applicants to make them in person in Brussels or Paris.

Coffee Caye is a .-acre uninhabited tropical paradise off the coast of Belize and is now better known as the Principality of Islandia. The island, which is shaped a bit like a coffee bean, can be walked in just minutes. But its small size hasnapost stopped the micronation from claiming independence. In  the Letaposs Buy an Island project was started with the aim of crowdfunding for an island and by December  it had raised over £,. The group picked Coffee Caye, located just a -minute boat ride from Belize City, and forked out £, plus tax. Lets Buy an Island co-founder Marshall Mayer toldCNN: Who wouldnapost want to buy an island That feeling of stepping onto an island that youaposve invested in, and own, thataposs an amazing feeling. The idea for Islandia was actually born  years ago when co-founder and CEO Gareth Johnson bought the domain name letsbuyanisland, thinking that the idea sounded funny, The Daily Star reports.  After looking into it over a number of years the group realised that buying an island was much more realistic than they originally imagined. Investors can now buy shares in Islandia for £,, with each of the shareholders entitled to one vote in the micronationaposs democracy.  people have also bought citizenship for just £ without actually becoming an investor.Johnson toldCNN: Who hasnapost dreamed of making their own country  Particularly in a post-Trump, post-Brexit, Covid world. If a bunch of regular people can make this work, perhaps it can be a force for good.  Islandia now has its own flag, novelty passports, a national anthem and government elected by the investors. Johnson even joked that he has a special role as Head of the Secret Police. This year marked the first tour of the island, with Mayer taking a group of investors and tourists for a camping trip. Those going in the future will have to abide by a number of special rules such as aposno single-use plasticapos, although in reality it still falls under the jurisdiction of Belize. Put simply, a micronation is an entity whose members claim to be a sovereign state but arenapost recognised by world governments or major international organisations. The claims are so trivial that they are largely ignored by the countries around them.  One of the most notable examples is the Principality of Sealand, an anti-aircraft  in the North Sea built during World War Two and seized by a pirate radio group in . Sealand continues to assert its status as a nation by issuing its own money and stamps. The Free Republic of Liberland was founded in , sitting between Croatia and Serbia. Border disputes between the countries mean some land there is claimed by both or neither. Liberland has even established formal ties with Somaliland, a de facto state in the Horn of Africa.

Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Alina Kabaeva - once described as “ Russia ’s most flexible woman“ - reportedly travelled to a “very private and very secure” chalet near here with the couple’s young children as the tanks rolled in.Widely believed to be the mother of Putin’s two sons and a daughter - or possibly two daughters - Kabaeva, , lives in a luxurious bubble, shielded from the horrors her -year-old partner is inflicting on innocent children.  Switzerland has a long history of providing low-tax secrecy to the world’s most powerful. Here, the Kremlin tyrant’s family is unlikely to be exposed.A source in Lugano, close to the Italian border, said: “Before the coronavirus pandemic there was often gossip about Putin’s mistress being in town. They are known to have strong connections here, but anyone who knows them has been sworn to secrecy.“While Russia falls apart because of the sanctions, this is the perfect place for Putin to send Alina and their kids.” Claims of Putin’s links to Lugano first surfaced seven years ago. In February , a local TV station reported that Kabeava had given birth at a private VIP maternity clinic in Sorengo, on the periphery of the city.  They were said to have reserved two rooms at the discreet private maternity hospital Clinic Sant’Anna - a favourite of wealthy Russians. One suite was for the birth the second for family and bodyguards. According to insiders, President Putin was present. The Kremlin, of course, dismissed the rumours, as it does any query about Putin’s private le. Kabaeva, one of the most decorated rhythmic gymnasts in history, has never confirmed whether they have one daughter, or twin girls. Likewise, neither has ever addressed claims they got married in a secret ceremony after Putin orced his first we. Bathed in balmy spring sunshine this week, the contrast between the restful serenity of the Sant’Anna and the maternity hospital bombed by Russian troops in Mariupol, Ukraine, could not be more stark.High-end clients drove expensive vehicles into an underground car park beneath a carefully manicured lawn, with a topiaried flamingo at the entrance. Birdsong could be heard in the little vineyard nearby.  Meanwhile shells still pounded Mariupol at the other end of Europe, after heavily pregnant mums had been carried out on stretchers through the rubble. In Lugano’s glistening Piazza Della Rorma, where Kabeava is said to have been seen on occasions, grey-haired men stroll past the café terraces with statuesque supermodel girlfriends. Occasional snippets of Russian puncture predominantly Italian background chatter. It is a sedate place dominated by banks, pharmacies and designer goods, and restaurants with eye-wateringly expensive menus.  Above Lake Lugano, modernist four-storey villas with infinity pools are embedded into the mountains. Their owners drive directly onto the roof, and go downstairs in private elevators. These are perfect properties for people wanting to keep clear of prying eyes, Alina Kabaeva is not the only person close to Putin with links to Lugano. Oligarch Alexey Mordashov, Russia’s second-richest man with a personal fortune estimated at £bn last year, was added to the EU sanctions list last week. Steel and mining baron Mordashov, , was targeted because of Rossiya Bank, in which he has a stake.  Rossiya was described as the “personal bank” of Russian officials who benefited from the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in . The EU also said it believes media businesses Mordashov is invested in helped destabilise Ukraine through pro-Russian television stations. The export arm of Mordashov’s steel and mining empire, Severstal, is located in an anonymous office building in a drab industrial park in Manno, on the outskirts of Lugano. Mordashov’s below-the-radar presence is marked only on a list of business names on a sign in the car park. Last week the billionaire’s private jet was tracked as flying back to the Seychelles from Moscow. In a statement, Mordashov said he did not understand how his name was on the sanctions list, adding: “I have absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension.”  Calling for an end to the current war, he went on: “It is terrible that Ukrainians and Russians are dying, people are suffering hardships, the economy is collapsing.” Russia’s richest .% - who together possess wealth greater than the remaining .% of the population - are not only attracted by Switzerland’s pleasant climate and stunning vistas. Recent data shows that around a third of their bank balances worldwide are in the Alpine nation. According to a  survey by ErnstYoung, banks in Zurich and Geneva are favoured by the oligarchs. Putin’s childhood friend from St Petersburg, Gennady Timchenko, was based in Switzerland until , when he was sanctioned by the US over the Crimean invasion. When Russia invaded Ukraine a fortnight ago, Timchenko was one of the first oligarchs sanctioned by Britain. Much of his wealth derived from being granted an oil export licence by Putin, his ice hockey buddy, in . He still owns a gigantic mansion on Lake Geneva. Like upmarket Belgravia in London, Switzerland has long been a playground for Putin’s oligarch friends with their limitless wealth. For Alina Kabaeva and Putin’s unseen children, it could also remain the ideal bolthole while her despot partner keeps shelling innocent civilians. Previously given high-profile political appointments because of her relationship, she is accustomed to obeying her bullying partner. As global outrage against Putin’s despicable war gets louder, the Ferraris and Lamborghinis still purr around Lake Lugano.

Slavinsky claimed that “restrictive” political and economic sanctions from the West allowed the court to refuse infringement claims brought forward by Entertainment One UK Ltd.  The court ruling links the Peppa Pig and Daddy Pig infringement claim to unfriendly actions of the United States of America and affiliated foreign countries”, according to legal documents from the Kirov case. Sanctions against Russia allow the court not to protect the UK company’s trademark rights, said the judge amid suspicion the case has been seized on by the authorities in Moscow as a weapon against Western sanctions. Entertainment Oneaposs case in sleepy Kirov -  miles northeast of Moscow - had claimed an abuse of right”.  The obscure case was brought against Ivan Kozhevnikov, an entrepreneur, to protect trademark rights for drawings of the beloved childrenaposs cartoon characters. At the hearing, the judge appeared well-versed in the nuances of the latest sanctions developments. The British company can appeal the bizarre ruling against its claim for around £ in compensation for unlawful copying of its images. By the time the case was heard, the value of the claim had sunk to £ due to the plummeting of Putin’s rouble currency caused by the war in Ukraine.The ruling is seen as revenge for Western patent authorities severing their ties with Russia due to the Ukrainian crisis. The company had previously enjoyed success in Russia over its claims.  The Kirov case is one of multiple Peppa and Daddy Pig infringement cases filed in Russia from Britain including several in Siberia.The Russians could have been aware of Boris Johnson ’s admiration for Peppa Pig after his bizarre November speech to the Confederation of British Industry.Referring to a theme park in Hampshire, he told surprised business executives: Yesterday I went, as we all must, to Peppa Pig World…  “I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place: it has very safe streets, discipline in schools.”He went on, after losing his place in his speech: Who would have believed that a pig that looks like a hairdryer or possibly a Picasso-like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC, would now be exported to  countries with theme parks both in America and China ”The ruling could trigger more widespread abuse of trademarks as was common in Russia in the years after the fall of the Soviet Union in .

Andrei Kozyrev, who was Boris Yeltsin’s leading diplomat, believes key figures in the Kremlin may be plotting the Russian President’s downfall. It comes as Russian troops edge towards Ukraineaposs capital Kyiv, with reports overnight stating the bulk of Russian forces are now just km from the city following a night of intense fighting. But Mr Kozyrev, who was foreign minister from  to , believes Putin could soon be ousted with an “armed escort either to the grave or to retirement.”This is because, according to Mr Kozyrev, Russian forces are bogged down in Ukraine and the country is isolated due to sanctions. He told The Times: “Many Russian tsars were killed. Many were dismissed one way or the other.“Even in the Soviet Union, there were ways Stalin was said to have been poisoned, Khrushchev was just escorted out of the Kremlin. “With Putin, I very much expect there to be resistance growing and discontent growing that will be resolved one way or another.  “I don’t know which way but Russian history is full of unexpected outcomes.” Speaking about Putinaposs decision to invade, Mr Kozyrev said: “It’s horric but it’s not irrational. To understand why the invasion was rational for Putin, we have to step into his shoes.” Mr Kozyrev, who now lives in Miami, believes Putin is not insane, but simply wrong and immoral. It comes as reports suggested Russian forces made progress overnight from north-east Ukraine in their fight to reach the capital Kyiv. In an update on Saturday morning, the Ministry of Defencesaid fighting to the north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv continued, with the bulk of Russian ground forces now about  kilometres from its centre.Elements of the large Russian column north of Kyiv have dispersed, the MoD added, which it said is likely to support an attempt by the aggressors to encircle the city. Kyiv mayor and former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko believes there are nearly two million people still left in the city that is being attacked on several fronts. He said Kyiv had enough vital supplies for a couple of weeks and supply lines remain open. It is feared the capital could face the same fate as Mariupol which has encircled for days.Mikhail Podoliak, adviser to Ukraine’s hero President Volodymyr Zelensky, said although Kyiv was under siege it was ready to fight. He added: “The defence is well thought out and supply has been adjusted.” Mr Podoliak vowed Kyiv’s defenders – troops and civil defence members – are “charged, focused and professional.” He added: “The full political leadership of the country is in the capital.” Ukraine says Moscow’s forces are killing more civilians than troops in artillery bombardments and air strikes on cities throughout the country. It is believed more than , Russian soldiers have died in fighting while in excess of , Ukraine civilians have been killed. The toll on Kyiv’s troops is unknown. Meanwhile, the UK Government is intending to further ramp up pressure on the Kremlin with plans to ban exports of luxury goods to Russia in the latest move to isolate Putin.Details of the plans will be set out in the coming days, Downing Street said.It came as Boris Johnson joined with other G leaders on Friday to commit to further increase the pressure on the Russian president’s regime.The group agreed to take steps to deny Russia “most favoured nation” status on key products, which No  said would signicantly reduce the ability of Russian businesses to export.

There are still major gaps on the UK’s list. Among those we have yet to take action against include the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu, deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Grigorenko, and Igor Osipov, the commander-in-chief of the Black Sea fleet. The case for action could not be more pressing when Putin is reported to be prepared to use chemical and biological weapons. He is committing crimes against humanity. There can be no delay in imposing sanctions on all those who are complicit in these war crimes.  Wary on virus Boris Johnson may believe that the Covid threat has passed but the figures tell a dferent story. More than two million people in England were infected with the virus last week, with those needing hospital treatment up %. There is also evidence the new Deltacrom iant is starting to get a foothold in Britain. Given the virus remains so virulent the Government should halt plans to scrap free testing and the removal of financial support for those who need to self-isolate.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty round up saturday march 5 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe new shinty season got up and running with goals galore across the country on Saturday March .Fort William  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from two goals down to earn a -

their papers separately away from the school hall, heads were told.Ofqual advised that schools can use special consideration to help pupils, for example allowing them to sit papers at dferent times.Tom Middlehurst, the Association of School and College Leaders’ curriculum lead, said in a discussion of the  GCSE and A level exams, that “one of the things we’re picking up…is that there are a large number of more students who have evidenced anxiety and are coming with doctor’s notes and GP notes saying ‘we have anxiety about coming to the exams’ or ‘we need our own room and therefore an invigilator”.“For schools and colleges that is just not practical,” he said at the school leaders’ annual conference, adding, “That’s not something they’re able to do.”Jo Saxton, Ofqual’s chief regulator, said that exam boards must make sure they had thought through the implications for special consideration for pupils in .“Make sure you’ve thought about being adaptable and flexible enough to meet the needs of students in , so we’re asking them to think those things through.“I’ve been really clear with exam boards that meeting the needs of students is my first priority,” she said.She said there were scenarios where they could allow dferent timings for papers or other adjustments that could be make to help anxious pupils.“ all sorts of arrangements that can be used when there are clashes, and sophysical spaces are the limiting factor, exam boards are required through special consideration requirements that we have to work withto meet the needs of students,” she said.Richard Garrett, Ofqual’s policy director, said thatschools were finding inidual cases tricky to make a judgment on they should contact their exam board.Dr Saxton said pupils she spoke to were “adamant” that they did not want people to look down upon their teacher-assessed results, awarded following the cancellation of full public exams during the pandemic..remove“In fact some of the students…were angry

heard students saying up and down the country”.“We’ve heard calls for an approach that somehow takes account of the dferential impact of the pandemic, regional grading perhaps, or some sort of inidual Covid uplt for those students most affected during their course,” she said, adding she understood these demands “intuitively” as it did not feel fair that some students had been so badly affected in comparison to others.“Qualications will only serve young people like those I talked to yesterday in the long termthey give a reliable indication of what the student knows and understands,” she said.“I’ve met students at college at the moment on what they call ‘Covid grades’.“Some of the students I talked to last week are realising that their apprenticeship is further away than they thought because they have more maths to do than their grades had indicated.”“As a society we won’t recover from this tragic pandemicstudents receive grades that just aren’t based on what they know and can do,” she said.Students sitting GCSEs and A levels this summer will have some support in place to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.Exams regulator Ofqual has previously announced that grade boundaries will be set roughly between  pre-pandemic levels and boundaries in , when teacher assessment was used to set grades.And in all subjects, with the exception of English literature, history, ancient history, geography and art and design, pupils will be given notice about the topics to be covered in this summer’s exams.The information is designed to aid their preparation and help focus their revision.In GCSE maths, combined science and physics, pupils will be given equation sheets to reduce the number of equations they need to memorise.In GCSE English literature, history, ancient history and geography, subjects where advance information will not be released, pupils will study and be examined on fewer topics.An Ofqual spokesperson claried: “Dferent times could mean, for example, a student starting their paper a few minutes later than others, once other students in the exam hall had settled down. This has previously happened when a student has been anxious prior to entering an exam hall.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

the previous weekend through a flurry of late goals, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils took the lead within the opening minute.Captain Keith Mitchell’s ball down the left channel found winger Scott Souden, who cut inside and rounded the far-advanced St Peter’s goalkeeper, way out of his penalty area, and tucked the ball home low from around  yards.The first half was a well-contested affair, with chances at both ends, with the Pupils’ Lewis McNaughton and Donald McCallum both going close with efforts at goal, while at the other end, St Peter’s continued to probe for an equaliser.This arrived just a few minutes before half-time, albeit in rather fortuitous circumstances, when a low shot from the visitors’ centre-forward from just inside the box evaded the grasp of keeper Alasdair Ferguson.Early into the second half, the Pupils found themselves -

successful schemes, including widening footpaths, cycle lanes and reducing speed limits, other projects were unable to be introduced in the -month time limit on funding.This included proposals to introduce ebike hire schemes in town across the county, with Musselburgh the only place where the scheme got off the ground.Alan Stubbs, the council’s road services manager, told the meeting: “The

colleague Morag Haddow added: “There was a worldwide shortage of bikes in .”The meeting was told that plans to roll out the ebikes remained in place however, there was now also a shortage of the

Scottish Conservative leader, and also Craig Hoy, South Scotland MSP, who visited them last month.The pair thanked the apprentices for their work in transforming derelict space to the rear of Dunbar High Street into an education, heritage and horticultural centre for residents to enjoy and learn from.Mr Ross, who is also an MP, said: “This project is a fantastic example of community working in action.Those involved in helping to transform this area should be extremely proud of all the work that they have carried out.”The apprentices have conducted restorative work on some of the town’s oldest buildings, providing residents with the opportunity to explore first-hand Dunbar’s architectural heritage and history.The group is in the process of renovating a time capsule flat in Dunbar

He said: “All that the apprentices have been doing has improved the lives of people from the local community, as well as developing key skills.“In addition to providing fantastic learning opportunities for people of all ages, the apprentices have helped to give people an insight into the town’s heritage and provided a space for people to reflect at The Ridge’s dementia-friendly Sanctuary Garden.”Kate Darrah, founder and managing director of The Ridge, said: “We are so proud of the achievements of our apprentice team.“In the process, they are building their own skills and making a start on a really satisfying, high-quality craft career.“Many of these youngsters struggled in school and have amazed themselves with their stunning success in a practical setting.“Their skills are now contributing something wonderful to the wider community, which will endure for many years to come, and which provides an additional layer to our shared sense of pride in these hard-working and talented iniduals.”"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-1997-1972-1922","story":"‘SCHOOL slammed by inspectors’ was front page news in the East Lothian Courier on March , .A major shake-up of the running of Knox Academy has been called for after a visit by Schools Inspectors who made swingeing criticisms and said teaching ied from very good to unsatisfactory.Setting out an action plan for change, they said the morale of some teachers was low and staff generally felt distanced from the senior management team.“A lack of whole-school direction had led to teachers having inconsistent expectations of pupils on important matters such as attendance, discipline and standards of attainment,” their report revealed.“Overall a firm lead was required from senior management to develop a common sense of purpose among staff and pupils.”Some parents questioned by the inspectors said they did not find head-teacher Anthony B.

Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.There is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website here.The Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/13541903.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"wordle-262-todays-wordle-word-8-march-hints-answer","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter S and ends with the letter T.It contains two of the same letter.It is a word to describe a pleasant, not bitter taste. If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

Using mythology and history, James spins a vivid and compelling fantasy world, drawing the reader in from the first page. His unique and uncompromising language is key to the immersive effect, often expressing complicated concepts and emotions with breathtaking clarity and charm. The Booker Prize-winning author of A Brief History Of Seven Killings gives his characters enough humour and wit to counter the hum of evil running throughout the story.

Its perhaps a shame theres been so much noise around the book - its almost impossible to live up to, and it doesnt quite make the mark. The action takes place on multiple timelines - present day, where Nurhas just told his parents hes been seeing a black woman for four years- and Nurs blossoming relationship with Yasmina, from meeting at university to forming a relationship - all while he continues to hide her from his parents, scared of how they might react. Ali is a talented writer and its extremely readable, but the jumping timelines is a bit of a stranglehold, and prevents much from actually happening.

Atwood doesnt do sentimentality, but these pieces carry emotional weight. Her frank admission that she continued with a book tour when her partner Graeme Gibson died - postponing the empty house she faced upon- will resonate with many who have experienced loss. For Atwood, perhaps the most burning questions are those concerning the climate crisis, with stark warnings peppering the collection.

The kind of people, Corre complained, who would have hated punk back in the s.As a result, Corre took John Lydon’s final sentiment in Anarchy in the UK – “Destroy” – to heart. He announced he was going to burn some of his own collection of punk memorabilia.And so, on the river on this particular November day effigies of ious politicians – David Cameron, George Osborne and May herself – were put to the torch, along with a chest containing clothes, posters and other memorabilia worth, Corre claimed, £ million.It was that figure that caught the eye of the media and caused a small scandal at the time. Corre was burning important cultural artefacts, some said. Sell the collection and give the money to charity, others argued. Newspaper columnists labelled Corre attention-seeking and juvenile.He went ahead anyway and had film maker Nigel Askew record the event. Now five-and-a-half years later a documentary about the event is receiving its world premiere at the Glasgow Film Festival this evening.Wake Up Punk is a film about what punk meant then and still means now. It’s also about Corre’s parents who were also, one could say, the parents of punk, and Corre’s relationship with them. In passing it also tackles the idea of news as entertainment and empty spectacle.And it’s a film about Corre’s self-belief and, critics might say, self-importance. Which is the very thing that makes him fun to talk to, of course. In our time together he’s mouthy, outspoken, dismissive of others’ opinions and often quite funny into the bargain.It’s a Thursday morning in February when we talk via Zoom. I’m at home, he’s in his office in Clerkenwell. In the background people ghost past as he talks about his past, his parents, and about lingerie and bondage trousers.“The title of the film Wake Up Punk is really a message to those people to say wake up and actually see what’s important,” Corre explains. “Don’t try to be nostalgic about something that was never meant to be nostalgic. It was something that was very current at the time and then lost its energy. There’s no point trying to resurrect that energy in an old way.”Joe Core. Photograph Paul Stuart One of the things Corre rails against – in the film and in person – is the commodication of the idea of punk Virgin’s Sex Pistols credit card, McDonald’s using Buzzcocks to sell peri peri chicken wraps, BrewDog’s Punk IPA.Punk, Corre suggests, has become a meaningless word. “It’s on a bottle of beer. If you drink that beer, you’re a punk  ‘I pay for my McDonald’s with my Never Mind the Bollocks credit card because I’m so alternative.’ It’s pathetic really.”Corre’s position on all this is not welcomed by everybody. Wake Up Punk, to its credit, acknowledges as much. At one point we are reminded that Corre has been dismissed as the “Eric Trump of Punk” . And there’s a sequence at a public event where Corre is gunning for everyone and more than a few are gunning back. He is even labelled a bully.“When you stick your head above the parapet people hate you for it,” Corre suggests. He’s known this all his le, he says. Born in , he was just a kid when his parents were at the heart of the punk media storm“It’s very memorable to me as a young kid growing up through that time how much people hated you. Grown men would come and spit in my face in the street. The National Front came outside our flat and smashed all our windows and threw fireworks in. We had death threats on the phone, turds through the letter box. My parents’ shop in the King’s Road was smashed up every weekend by Cha football fans.”Every day, Corre reminds me, the tabloids were “drumming up hatred” against punk rockers.“It was manufactured hatred. And to stand up and do things at that time it took a hell of a lot of courage. Malcolm was there … some of the time. Most of the time he was hiding around a corner. So, he’d cause the aggravation and then disappear and let someone deal with it.”Your mum presumably “Vivienne always looked so incredibly glamorous and sexy. Those clothes that she designed at that time were the most glamorous thing you’d ever seen. But at the same time, she also looked like some kind of alien had landed from space because you’d never seen anyone like that. I would be literally walking up the road with her and cars would be crashing because she looked so amazing.”Add to that, “she’s got a disarming quality to anyone who ever wanted to be aggressive towards her,” he says. “She’s very disarming in that way.”Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood in the s Corre is, as you may have already gathered, slightly in awe of his mum. His dad, maybe not so much. In the past he has been highly critical of McLaren .With good reason, you might think. McLaren walked out on his family when Corre was barely into his teens. But the film suggests a rather more complex push-and-pull in Corre’s attitude towards his father. There is a lot of animus still, but there’s also a recognition of his father’s achievements.“People don’t understand the brilliance of him,” Corre says of McLaren. “I think it’s a bit of a shame that the information out there about Malcolm really focuses on his megalomania and all his bullshit really and doesn’t actually let you see the man himself who did some really brilliant things.”He tells me a story from childhood, from the pre-punk years. “When I was a really small kid my mother was a schoolteacher in south London and Malcolm was at art school. Vivienne taught a class which today would be called special needs. And within the space of about a year, a year and a half, that class had become the top class in the school.“None of those kids had ever been to the countryside so Malcolm and Vivienne and me and Ben [Corre’s half-brother] used to take these kids on these weekend outings. We’d turn up at the train station in the morning and Malcolm would get a couple of packets of sausages out of the shop. We’d get on the train and go down to Kent and just walk and they would have this incredible adventure. Malcolm was so neurotic and so full of wild energy he could make a fire by rubbing sticks together. He’d start a fire and cook the sausages and the kids would go wild for it.”He smiles at the memory.“He was great in that way. I guess he really identied with kids because I think he always identied himself as some kind of naughty child.“There’s a lot of aspects to Malcolm that I don’t think have been understood or shared. There’s a little bit of it in this film. So, what I can say is that, yeah, he was never really a father. But there were things about him that were fantastic and things that I treasure about him.“There were other times in my le where he really was there for me, and it was good to have him there.”Joe Corre. Photograph Paul Stuart McLaren died in . I wonderCorre has come to a dferent understanding of his father since his death “Yeah, I think so. One of the slightly painful things to me about this film, and the books that have come out about him, and the lies that are still told, is that through all of that is it hasn’t allowed me to close the book on it. It’s always there or thrown back at you.“I’m kind of hoping with this film, it’s kind of the end of it, and I don’t have to talk about it or think about it anymore.“He had a very disturbed childhood in many ways. What can you say that isn’t trite  But then he did things that I could never imagine doing. Hurtful things.”Well, yes. One of the revelations of the film is that Corre, after organising and co-ordinating a huge funeral for his father, then learned that McLaren, on his death bed has bluntly, hurtfully written him out of his will.“I don’t know why he wrote that will in that state of mind,” Corre admits. “All I know is thatI had been in that position, I could never have written those words about my child. I’d rather die … I know he was dying … I could never have done it and he did and that’s the end of that.“I didn’t want anything from him. I wasn’t expecting anything from him. But the thing that hurt was to write in that will, ‘My son will not inherit anything whatsoever.’ That’s the thing that hurts. So, you know … Anyway.”You could say that the story of Corre’s own le is the story of someone who had learned all of the lessons his father taught how to put on a show, how to get noticed, how to inject himself into the culture.When he and his then we Serena Rees set up Agent Provocateur, the upmarket lingerie brand, in , Corre knew how to get the media’s attention whether it was by having an Agent Provocateur-clad Kylie Minogue filmed on a bucking Bronco or dressing upthe likes of Kate Moss and Maggie Gyllenhaal in his lingerie.Agent Provocateur store. Photograph PA One could argue, I suppose, that for all his complaints about the commodication of punk he made his fortune commodying sexuality.“I’ve always been independent,” he says when I suggest as much. “When I started Agent Provocateur, I certainly took a leaf out of my parent’s book in terms of using your shop as a way to communicate ideas over and above simply sales. The ideas that I was pushing at that time were about … Well, I think we’d come out of that time in the late eighties of power dressing and big shoulders and women saying, ‘We can be as powerful as men, we can sit on the board of these companies, and we can do what we want.’“And, in some ways, by doing that it had kind of taken away the power of their femininity. You’ve got something special here and there’s nothing wrong with showing it off.“Later on, I have to say, after doing it for ,  years or something it became a business. The bigger something like that gets the more anti-creative it becomes.“In the end it becomes run by bean counters. And you spend your entire time arguing against the bean counters, and that’s not a great creative process to be in. And it certainly got to the point for me where it was like, I’m out of this.”His marriage broke upand the business was sold to a private equity house for £ million.Corre set up another fashion label A Child Of The Jagoon a much smaller scale and became more politically active. If his father was a mischief-maker and his mother got by with her charm, their son is a fighter.Corre and his mother Vivienne Westwood protesting against fracking “I wanted to get much more involved in political activism and the thing that grabbed me particularly was the fracking industry.”He did his bit in the resistance to fracking coming to the UK. He launched court cases, spoke to the media, protested, hired, he says, guards to protect other protesters.“I looked at it from a business point of view, to say thatI’m really going to make this thing work, I’ve got to be prepared to get involved in all these things. It’s not just about me going out with a banner saying, ‘Stop fracking.’”In  the UK government did a U-turn and did just that. “It took like seven years or something, but we won in the end,” Corre says.One of the keys to the campaign, he says, was understanding how the media works. The need for a good story. You could say that figure of £m he suggested for the worth of the punk memorabilia he torched was another example of that process at work. It’s a nice round figure, isn’t it Near the end of our conversation, I ask him, did the burning of the memorabilia work “If you’ve seen this film and at the end you are still asking that question you’ve kind of missed the point,” he says, putting me in my place. “Because the film is about asking people to question what they really value.“People have got to be responsible for their own actions and reactions, and that’s the message of the film. Was it worth it for me  Well, I guess we’ll see how good the film is. But I don’t have any regrets. I’d do the same thing tomorrow. I think I made the point I wanted to make.”Wake Up Punk has its world premiere at the Glasgow Film Theatre tonight as part of the Glasgow Film Festival. It also screens tomorrow at .pm. Visit glasgowfilm.orgWake Up Punk’s director Nigel Askew on Joe Corre and his parents:Why did you want to film the burning of the memorabilia I thought it was an important statement. It was a big statement to make that the authorities don’t own punk.I was documenting what was happening. And making suggestions of who we should talk to about it. But, of course, nobody wanted to talk to us. When it happened, Joe was like the worst demon on the planet and nobody wanted to know.The film offers a dferent vision of Vivienne Westwood than we normally see.For me, that was one of the most important things in the film, to show Vivienne not as a crazy person, because that’s how journalists tend to portray her. I wanted to have her as her true self with her sons. I think that came across.How do you view Joe Corre He really stands up for people. People were very unhappy when we started this film and I just hope they understand Joe better when they see the end result.In the film he acknowledges his father’s part in the story.Yeah, they had a dficult relationship. But, overall, Joe really respects his father for what he did and what he achieved. In my mind, he’s really sticking up for Malcolm’s point of view."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13561336.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ross-kemp-bridge-lies---everything-need-know-bbc-quiz-show","story":"Bridge of Lies.The ill-fated Northern Ireland crossing Thankfully not in this instance.

And it details how  Lords Provost had links to slavery – half of all those elected during the period – and how no fewer than  streets names honour those who supported or profited from the trade.Finally, the probe, by Glasgow University’s Stephen Mullen, calculates that bequests to the city from slave profits add up to £ million in today’s money, including £m that set up the Mitchell Library.: Without slavery Glasgow wouldnt exist: The brutal truth about Scotlands slaving pastMs Aitken said: “This is the most in-depth picture to date of Glasgow’s role in the enslavement of people and the benefits the city accrued from trades built on the trafficking and labour of enslaved people.“We’ve long been aware of the association of many of our street names with that past but now we understand just how far and deep the slave economy money went and how many people and organisations were involved in that, including Glasgow City Council’s own ancestor organisation.“The report reveals the money trail – how the tentacles of the slave economy reached far into Glasgow and helped build and shape this city. It goes into a much deeper level than just what we see in front of us and talks about the legacy of enslavement in today’s Glasgow. And this must be publicly acknowledged.”For decades many Scots have associated the slave trade and slave plantations with English ports. Glaswegians, however, were heavily invested in the business. Even before the union with England in . The new report unveils these early slavery links.“We need to be honest about Glasgow’s history, our involvement in the slave economy, the attempt at creating a Scottish empire and our deep role in the British Empire,” Ms Aitken said.“There are people who live every day with the legacy of their ancestors having been enslaved and Glasgow, and some people with very high status within it, had a very deep role in that. We need to step up and apologise, to express contrition and sorrow for our part in the moral atrocity of slavery and what the descendants of enslaved people still live with today.”The city council has set up a working group to look into the report and decide what to do. It is led by Graham Campbell, a councillor with Jamaican heritage who has a long-standing interest in the issue.Ms Aitken stressed that while the elected members on the group may change – there is an election in May – that there are members of BAME organisations who will provide continuity.: SNP ministers putting jobs at risk over refusal to open nuclear power talks with Rolls-RoyceInsiders say Glasgow does not have a key monument like that to slaver Edward Colston in Bristol or to Henry Dundas, the politician who delayed the abolition of the slave trade, in Edinburgh. But street names present a headache. The most likely outcome is plaques to explain their history.Ms Aitken said: “How do we respond to streets and monuments dedicated to people, or the very signicant number of high-profile men, who owned or trafficked enslaved people “The discovery that a forerunner to the city council had investments in the Company of Scotland worth hundreds of millions of pounds in today’s money, and that more than  lord provosts benefited financially, is new and signicant. So how do we reckon with these legacies  Another question we must ask ourselves is what permanent reminder should Glasgow create to recognise our role in this history “These questions and many others should form part of a wide-ranging public conversation about the report, our legacy, and our response to it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-players-rated-get-back-winning-ways-versus-italy-six-nations","story":"Eduardo Padovani Some intelligent kicking and counter-attacking ball in hand played a signicant role in his team’s best moments.  out of Pierre Bruno Showed excellent strength and awareness to stay infield and offload to Braley for the scrum-half’s try. Juan Ignacio Brex Went off for HIA at a crucial moment close to half-time as Scotland capitalised on his absence. Leonardo Marin Played his part in a competitive outing by the Italian midfield but never had the opportunity to make a real dference. Monty Ioane The winger came infield looking for work and was a powerful threat when close to the touchline too, posing a danger to Scotland every time he got possession. Paolo Garbisi Contributed seven points with a penalty and two conversions and a penalty and made good use of many of his possessions without ever producing the spark of magic his team needed to get on top. Callum Braley The recalled scrum-half was on the end of an excellent move for his team’s try and also put in some intelligent short kicks to keep the Scotland defence guessing. Danilo Fischetti Had his hands full in the scrum trying to deal with Zander Fagerson and conceded a crucial penalty just before half-time.  Giacomo Nicotera A solid debut from the Benetton hooker as he held his own in the set piece and in open play. Pietro Ceccarelli The former Edinburgh tighthead was up against the capital club’s current loosehead in Schoeman and had to work really hard to avoid being over-run. Niccolo Canone The lock played second fiddle in the set piece to Sam Skinner and Grant Gilchrist as Scotland got the better of the breakdown battle. Federico Ruzza Competed well throughout and played a supporting role in Capuozzo’s stoppage-time try. Giovanni Pettinelli Showed good staying power to be involved in the fray right up until his departure ten minutes from time. Michele Lamaro The captain was off the field briefly for a first-half HIA and was notably less influential than usual. Toa Halafihi A formidable physical competitor, the No  was the pick of the home pack, never losing his cutting edge in attack as he battled away through the  minutes and beyond. Best of the rest Ange Capuozzo The Grenoble back had a memorable debut as he showed some exemplary trickery to bag two tries. SCOTLANDStuart Hogg Back close to or at his best with ball in hand, the full-back clearly relished a contest which he deservedly rounded off with a try.  out of Darcy Graham A vital linkman for Johnson’s opening try, the winger then grabbed one of his own with a trademark turn of direction to ease past two defenders. Chris Harris The cornerstone of the visitors’ defensive organisation, the centre was equally prominent in attack with some promising carries, including the two first-half tries which provided Scotland with some breathing space. Sam Johnson Took his try really well and was also a useful auxiliary target in the lineout at times. Has surely done enough on his recall to keep his place for next Saturday’s trip to Dublin. Kyle Steyn A powerful attacker with ball in hand, he also showed up well in defence, especially near the end when preventing a try in the corner as Italy rallied. Finn Russell Carried out the game plan astutely and put in some clever short passes as Scotland achieved real continuity in attack. Not back to his imperious best yet, but definitely getting closer. Ali Price Celebrated his th try with a man-of-the-match performance, beginning when he carried on Turner’s attack for Johnson’s try, continuing with the scoring pass for Hogg. Pierre Schoeman Rumbustious runs and some tenacious tackling made this another solid afternoon for the Edinburgh loosehead. George Turner Brilliant attacking run up the right touchline produced the opening for his team’s first points of the day. Zander Fagerson The Glasgow tighthead enjoyed a good afternoon in the scrum and in the loose. Sam Skinner Provided good support in the loose as well as working efficiently in tandem with Gilchrist in the set piece. Grant Gilchrist Solidity personied in the lineout and was a reliable carrier as ever. Rory Darge A menace throughout to the Italian defence, who simply could not contain him at the breakdown. Hamish Watson Back close to his bullish best after missing the France game, he combined well with Darge, suggesting that the two-opensides strategy is definitely viable against somenot all opposition.

It would be a huge achievementGregor Townsend’s boys manage to pull that off, and they know that they will have to play an awful lot better over the full  minutes than they did during this patchy performance. The team’s recent losses to Wales and France had clearly shaken confidence, which was evident as Scotland struggled to find a rhythm during the opening quarter of an hour in this match, committing several unforced errors including the concession of three soft penalties, with a lazy offside straight from a line-out on four minutes allowing Paolo Garbisi to nudge the hoists into a three-point lead.  Against higher calibre opposition this game could have been out of sight before the Scots had fired a shot.  Eventually, however, things clicked for the visitors on  minutes when captain Stuart Hogg countered from deep, Darcy Graham provided the link, and George Turner set off like a runaway bison up the right touchline,. Ali Price – who ended up man-of-the-match – carried the move on, and when he was brought down  yards from glory, Graham reappeared to scoop up possession and feed Finn Russell, who fired one of his trademark miss-passes leftward for Sam Johnson to score in the corner.  Italy came back hard, aided by a loose pass from Russell, which Azzurri No  Toa Halafihi latched on to and carried deep into Scotland’s . But the visitors rode their luck then delivered a -of-the-park sucker-punch, which came from a Price interception on his own line and featured a smart chip ahead from Kyle Steyn to send Chris Harris on an unchallenged canter under the sticks.  It was a bitter pill to swallow for the home side, but a lack of resilience is not one of the many problems facing Italy as they battle to be competitive members of the Six Nations community, and they dug deep again. After a long-range penalty attempt from Garbisi fell short, the home side’s perseverance was finally rewarded when a set move straight off scrum ball in the middle of the park, culminated in Pierre Bruno passing back inside just before being bundled into touch by Hogg, to provide Callum Braley with the simplest of finishes.  Scotland, however, had the last word of the half with a scrum move of their own, with Russell and Hogg combining to tie up Italy’s midfield defence before Harris hit the line hard to score his second try of the match.  Two out of three conversions from Russell meant the Scots were nine points ahead at the break, but they still didn’t look entirely sure of themselves, squandering possession twice in five minutes before it finally clicked again when Graham collected an inside pass from Russell and scrambled home on  minutes to bring up the bonus-point.  Then Price took just enough time to weigh up his options after gathering possession in the backfield for a gap to open up which he happily darted through, and while his pass to Hogg almost certainly floated forward, referee Luke Pearce was content to attribute that to momentum and promptly raised his arm to award Scotland their fth try of the contest.  At last, it looked like Scotland might be about to rediscover some of the swagger we haven’t really seen since Graham’s try in the first half of their round two match against Wales – but then they lost their way. Meanwhile, Italy were down, but they weren’t prepared to drop out of this match without a fight, and they struck back through replacement winger Ange Capuozzo, with Garbisi’s touchline conversion making it - with just over  minutes left to play.  The home team dominated the remainder of the match and the Scots had to dig deep to keep their line intact, which they managed to do until the third minute of injury-time, when Capuozzo wriggled over for his second try.  It wasn’t enough to salvage a bonus-point but will provide the Azzurri with some sort of morale boost as they continue to scrap to stay relevant in this championship.  Teams – Italy: E PadovaniP Bruno , J Brex , L Marin, M Ioane P Garbisi, C BraleyD Fischetti , G Nicotera , P Ceccarelli , N Cannone , F Ruzza, G Pettinelli , M Lamaro , T Halafihi. Scotland: S Hogg D Graham, C Harris, S Johnson , K Steyn F Russell , A PriceP Schoeman , G Turner , Z Fagerson , S Skinner , G Gilchrist, R Darge, H Watson, M Fagerson . Referee: Luke Pearce  Scorers – Italy: Tries Braley, Capuozzo  Cons Garbisi Pen Garbisi Scotland: Tries Johnson, Harris , Graham, Hogg Cons: Russell ."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Orkney Islands Council has announced that it will be installing card payment machines in its car parks, thanks to a boost from the Scottish Government.New ticket machines being installed in the coming weeks will offer contactless and chip and pin card payments.Work to install the machines – which will also accept coins – starts from Monday  March.The new machines are fully funded by the Scottish Government Place Based Investment Programme Capital Fund.All new machines are expected to be in place by the end of March.OIC’s roads support manager, Kenny Roy, said: “The existing machines require more and more maintenance now and are due to be replaced.“The option to pay by card has been a growing request over the past few years from our community and visitors, so we’re pleased to have secured funding from the Scottish Government to help us invest in that option.”Once works start, there will be periods during the installation of new power supplies and of the new machines, when parking in the car parks affected will be free of charge due to temporary unavailability of the machines.All other conditions of the car park order will continue to apply and be enforced, such as maximum stays and parking within marked bays.Drivers are being asked by the council to continue to use the bays in the short stay “pay and display” car parks for a maximum of three hours to ensure a turnover of available spaces. You should always check whether the machine is working and not assume free parking is available.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This tournament is about winning but you’ve also got to learn at times. We learned from the France game and I felt that was reflected in how we managed the game.“Our key decision-makers controlled things really well. That was pleasing.

It was great to see him play so well on such a big day for him.”Captain Stuart Hogg felt Scotland played well overall.“We wanted to come out here and give a true reflection of ourselves and make sure we gave a professional performance,” he said. “For large parts of that game we did exactly that but unfortunately we had a lapse in concentration every now and then that resulted in Italy scoring points, which we’re quite frustrated about.“But on the whole, it was pleasing to come away with a victory.”Italy head coach Kieran Crowley felt his team were poor defensively as they were consigned to the wooden spoon once more.“Defence was the area that let us down,” he said. “In our last two games we’ve defended very well but we missed too many one-on-one tackles today.“On the other side, I thought our attack was a lot better today, but you’ve got to get a combination of attack and defence.“Our defence let us down particularly in the first half, and in the first  minutes of the second half Scotland suffocated us a little bit but I’m very pleased with the way we bounced back later in the game.”"},{"url":null,"title":"raducanu-celebrates-opening-win-indian-wells---saturdays-sporting-social  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

told.Ofqual advised that schools can use special consideration to help pupils, for example allowing them to sit papers at dferent times.Tom Middlehurst, the Association of School and College Leaders’ curriculum lead, said in a discussion of the  GCSE and A level exams, that “one of the things we’re picking up…is that there are a large number of more students who have evidenced anxiety and are coming with doctor’s notes and GP notes saying ‘we have anxiety about coming to the exams’ or ‘we need our own room and therefore an invigilator”.“For schools and colleges that is just not practical,” he said at the school leaders’ annual conference, adding, “That’s not something they’re able to do.”Jo Saxton, Ofqual’s chief regulator, said that exam boards must make sure they had thought through the implications for special consideration for pupils in .“Make sure you’ve thought about being adaptable and flexible enough to meet the needs of students in , so we’re asking them to think those things through.“I’ve been really clear with exam boards that meeting the needs of students is my first priority,” she said.She said there were scenarios where they could allow dferent timings for papers or other adjustments that could be make to help anxious pupils.“ all sorts of arrangements that can be used when there are clashes, and sophysical spaces are the limiting factor, exam boards are required through special consideration requirements that we have to work withto meet the needs of students,” she said.Richard Garrett, Ofqual’s policy director, said thatschools were finding inidual cases tricky to make a judgment on they should contact their exam board.Dr Saxton said pupils she spoke to were “adamant” that they did not want people to look down upon their teacher-assessed results, awarded following the cancellation of full public exams during the pandemic.“In fact some of the students…were angry that the GCSEs they were awarded in  are doubted by some,” she said.\"

One pupil had been “very clear he does not want to go to university not having done public exams, and that’s something I’ve heard students saying up and down the country”.“We’ve heard calls for an approach that somehow takes account of the dferential impact of the pandemic, regional grading perhaps, or some sort of inidual Covid uplt for those students most affected during their course,” she said, adding she understood these demands “intuitively” as it did not feel fair that some students had been so badly affected in comparison to others.“Qualications will only serve young people like those I talked to yesterday in the long termthey give a reliable indication of what the student knows and understands,” she said.“I’ve met students at college at the moment on what they call ‘Covid grades’.“Some of the students I talked to last week are realising that their apprenticeship is further away than they thought because they have more maths to do than their grades had indicated.”“As a society we won’t recover from this tragic pandemicstudents receive grades that just aren’t based on what they know and can do,” she said.Students sitting GCSEs and A levels this summer will have some support in place to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.Exams regulator Ofqual has previously announced that grade boundaries will be set roughly between  pre-pandemic levels and boundaries in , when teacher assessment was used to set grades.And in all subjects, with the exception of English literature, history, ancient history, geography and art and design, pupils will be given notice about the topics to be covered in this summer’s exams.The information is designed to aid their preparation and help focus their revision.In GCSE maths, combined science and physics, pupils will be given equation sheets to reduce the number of equations they need to memorise.In GCSE English literature, history, ancient history and geography, subjects where advance information will not be released, pupils will study and be examined on fewer topics.An Ofqual spokesperson claried: “Dferent times could mean, for example, a student starting their paper a few minutes later than others, once other students in the exam hall had settled down. This has previously happened when a student has been anxious prior to entering an exam hall. It certainly wouldn’t mean on a dferent day.”"},{"url":null,"title":"harry-brushing-dutch-ahead-invictus-games-hague   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Matthew Martin played around several Bangor defenders and looked to pass up to Jason Campbell up front, who got into some promising positions.However, it was Bangor who broke the deadlock following a cross to the back post to take the lead.Play continued with both teams creating chances but neither were able to add to the scoreline before the end of the quarter.Bangor continued to apply pressure on lsquoHinch from the start of the second but the home side managed to manufacture counterattacks.lsquoHinch were playing the ball down the wings to Adam Dodds and Ross Connolly.Leslie Harrison played the ball out from the back to Andrew McIlwaine, only to be dispossessed by the Bangor defence.Play became end to end with teams trying to keep possession but unable to do so.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

This tournament is about winning but you’ve also got to learn at times. We learned from the France game and I felt that was reflected in how we managed the game.“Our key decision-makers controlled things really well. That was pleasing.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityOfqual advised that schools can use special consideration to help pupils, for example allowing them to sit papers at dferent times.Tom Middlehurst, the Association of School and College Leaders’ curriculum lead, said in a discussion of the  GCSE and A level exams, that “one of the things we’re picking up…is that there are a large number of more students who have evidenced anxiety and are coming with doctor’s notes and GP notes saying ‘we have anxiety about coming to the exams’ or ‘we need our own room and therefore an invigilator”.“For schools and colleges that is just not practical,” he said at the school leaders’ annual conference, adding, “That’s not something they’re able to do.”Jo Saxton, Ofqual’s chief regulator, said that exam boards must make sure they had thought through the implications for special consideration for pupils in .“Make sure you’ve thought about being adaptable and flexible enough to meet the needs of students in , so we’re asking them to think those things through.“I’ve been really clear with exam boards that meeting the needs of students is my first priority,” she said.She said there were scenarios where they could allow dferent timings for papers or other adjustments that could be make to help anxious pupils.“ all sorts of arrangements that can be used when there are clashes, and sophysical spaces are the limiting factor, exam boards are required through special consideration requirements that we have to work withto meet the needs of students,” she said.Richard Garrett, Ofqual’s policy director, said thatschools were finding inidual cases tricky to make a judgment on they should contact their exam board.Dr Saxton said pupils she spoke to were “adamant” that they did not want people to look down upon their teacher-assessed results, awarded following the cancellation of full public exams during the pandemic..remove“In fact some of the students…were angry that the GCSEs they were awarded in  are doubted by some,” she said.\" data-title\"School exam stock\" data--holder\"PA Archive\" data--notice\"PA Archive PA Images\" data-credit\"David Davies\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adcebbdbfcaaecfYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMTcNDA ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adcebbdbfcaaecfYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMTcNDA ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production adcebbdbfcaaecfYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMTcNDA ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"Maths exam in progress at Pittville High School, Cheltenham One pupil had been “very clear he does not want to go to university not having done public exams, and that’s something I’ve heard students saying up and down the country”.“We’ve heard calls for an approach that somehow takes account of the dferential impact of the pandemic, regional grading perhaps, or some sort of inidual Covid uplt for those students most affected during their course,” she said, adding she understood these demands “intuitively” as it did not feel fair that some students had been so badly affected in comparison to others.“Qualications will only serve young people like those I talked to yesterday in the long termthey give a reliable indication of what the student knows and understands,” she said.“I’ve met students at college at the moment on what they call ‘Covid grades’.“Some of the students I talked to last week are realising that their apprenticeship is further away than they thought because they have more maths to do than their grades had indicated.”“As a society we won’t recover from this tragic pandemicstudents receive grades that just aren’t based on what they know and can do,” she said.Students sitting GCSEs and A levels this summer will have some support in place to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.Exams regulator Ofqual has previously announced that grade boundaries will be set roughly between  pre-pandemic levels and boundaries in , when teacher assessment was used to set grades.And in all subjects, with the exception of English literature, history, ancient history, geography and art and design, pupils will be given notice about the topics to be covered in this summer’s exams.The information is designed to aid their preparation and help focus their revision.In GCSE maths, combined science and physics, pupils will be given equation sheets to reduce the number of equations they need to memorise.In GCSE English literature, history, ancient history and geography, subjects where advance information will not be released, pupils will study and be examined on fewer topics.An Ofqual spokesperson claried: “Dferent times could mean, for example, a student starting their paper a few minutes later than others, once other students in the exam hall had settled down. This has previously happened when a student has been anxious prior to entering an exam hall. It certainly wouldn’t mean on a dferent day.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Pupils with exam anxiety could sit papers at dferent times article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe romance gap, a term coined by Bumble, is a term for the disparity between men and women and our expectations of the genders when it comes to relationships and dating.% of respondents believed men are still expected to make the first move, according to a YouGov poll that was commissioned by Bumble.Almost  in  people in the UKsaid they expect men to take the lead but only % expected the same from women.Bumbles latest research suggests that daters want a very dferent kind of relationship dynamic.% of Brits say that equality is important between people who are dating or in a relationship.Meanwhile, % of respondents said that there are dferent expectations and expected behaviours depending on your gender when it comes to relationships.                                                                                                            :  Best Dating Sites in the UK to Find that Special Someone: Tinder is introducing a new security feature for users - is it coming to the UK                                                                                                            In other words, an overwhelming majority believe that there is a romance gap and that there are pressures for men and women to act a certain way.The dating app recognises that we have made \"positive strides towards equality, traditional gender roles and expectations are still very present, and even, accepted in dating\".In fact, some behaviours that we deem romantic for men are viewed negativelythey come from a woman.The research, which collected responses from across Europe, found that:.removeMen are still expected to take the lead: Over half of peoplestate that society expects men to take the lead in relationships, rising to almost  in  in the UK , whilst a mere % think society expects women to do so. For men, just over  in feel pressured to take the lead.Women should not appear desperate: In the UK, more than halfstate women are expected to avoid appearing too keen, clingy, attached or desperate. Interestingly this is felt signicantly more by womenthan men .Men worry about their lack of experience between the sheets: Nearly a fthof British men are concerned about being judged for their lack of sexual experience. Almost the same amount of womenfear they’ll be judged for the opposite - their number of intimate encounters. Women have a ‘shelf-le’ in dating: % state that women are expected to prioritise finding a relationship and settle down before they are ‘too old’. In contrast, only % say that society expects this of men. For women,  in have felt pressure to compromise on what they want while dating or in relationships. Men are expected to be the breadwinners: In the UK,  in say men are expected to earn more money and be responsible for finances, with only % agreeing this is expected of women.  in women have felt concerned of being judged for earning more than their partner. Women are changing their behaviour: Amidst all these expectations, it’s no surprise that  in women have changed their behaviour to make someone feel more powerful or comfortable. A couple on a date. Credit: Canva The new campaign forms part of Bumble’s efforts to empower people to create healthy and equitable relationships and combat \"outdated\" gender dynamics.“The Romance Gap is a new term, but many of us will know the feeling. Those moments of questioningsending that text makes you appear too keen, waiting for them to take the lead, or worryingyou are being judged for being too keen, too inexperienced, too old. At Bumble, we are focused on creating an app that empowers women to make the first move and date on their own terms from the beginning. But we alone cannot change societal expectations,\" Naomi Walkland, Bumble’s VP for Europe said.Ms Walkland continued: “An unexamined Romance Gap limits us, with  in  people agreeing that it makes it dficult to build equal relationships. The only way to reduce the Romance Gap is to acknowledge it exists and start an open conversation about how it impacts how we see ourselves, our partners, and relationships. Only when we are aware of it can we challenge each other to do away with gendered expectations of who should do what.”Its not just that the outdated genre dynamics are bad for equality, they stop us from making genuine connections with people, the dating app believes.According to its research, % say the impact of gender roles makes people behave in a way that is less true to who they are.It does appear though that change is on its way with % of respondents believing that in an ideal world we would not have expectations on who earns more, a more successful career , or who makes the first move by initiating a date .You can see the rest of Bumbles research, campaign and tips on striking up a conversation via the Bumble website."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/penarth_news/resources/images/13569145.jpg","title":"penarth news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.
