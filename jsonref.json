[{"url":null,"title":"North Korea releases pictures intercontinental missile launch","story":"Share this article   The US and South Korean militaries previously said the North was preparing for a full-range test of the Hwasong-17 after concluding two of the recent midrange launches included components of the new ICBM.Following a highly provocative streak in nuclear explosive and ICBM tests in 2017, Kim suspended such testing in 2018 ahead of his first meeting with then-President Donald Trump. But negotiations derailed in 2019 when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for a major release of US-led sanctions against the North in exchange for a limited surrender of its nuclear capabilities.The ICBMs launched in three 2017 test flights demonstrated they could reach into the US mainland. The larger Hwasong-17 may be intended to be armed with multiple warheads to overwhelm missile defenses.North Korea\u0027s government in January had issued a veiled threat to end Kim\u0027s moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests, citing U.S. hostility.South Korea\u0027s military has also detected signs that North Korea may be restoring some of the nuclear-testing tunnels it detonated just before Kim\u0027s first meeting with Trump in 2018.Some experts say the North may resume nuclear testing in coming months to claim it has acquired an ability to build nuclear warheads small enough to fit on some of its new delivery systems, including the hypersonic missile.North Korea has previously said nuclear weapons are the only thing saving the country from sharing Ukraine’s fate - the first sign that Pyongyang was nervous about Russia’s invasion.One high-ranking North Korean official said Ukraine would never have been attacked if it had kept its cache of Soviet nuclear weapons.While another said only nukes could prevent foreign invasions, and that the regime should prioritise national defence above seeking international aid.The startling admissions were revealed by Daily NK, a newspaper with sources inside the country, based in neighbouring South Korea.The example of Ukraine is not the only reason North Korea fears giving up its nukes.Pyongyang already viewed the denuclearisation of Libya in 2003 as a cautionary tale, noting how NATO later intervened there in 2011, leading to the death of its leader, Muammar Gaddafi. "},{"url":null,"title":"Zelensky scolds Europe late imposing sanctions Russia","story":"Share this article   The horror inflicted on civilians sheltering inside a Mariupol theatre that was bombed by Russian jets last week has been laid bare as the first footage from inside the destroyed building emerged today. Never-before-seen video shows injured civilians covered with dust filing out of the Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre after it was near-totally destroyed in Russian bombs aimed at building on March 16 despite a large inscription saying \u0027children\u0027 being clearly visible on the pavement outside.It came as city councillors said accounts they had been given from survivors of the bombing suggested that at least 300 people had died in the attack. If confirmed, it would mark the single largest losses of innocent life during the month-long war to date.   \u0027From eyewitnesses, information is emerging that about 300 people died in the Drama Theatre of Mariupol following strikes by a Russian aircraft,\u0027 Mariupol city hall wrote on Telegram.\u0027I do not want to believe in this horror. Until the last moment I want to believe that everyone managed to escape. But the words of those who were inside the building at the time of this terrorist act say the opposite,\u0027 officials said.Petr Andryuschenko, advisor to deputy mayor of Mariupol, said in a separate interview with the BBC that 600 people had been sheltering in the theatre at the time it was struck and that the 300 who are now presumed dead were in a bomb shelter underneath it which got buried in the rubble.The exact death toll is still uncertain because rescuers have not yet been able to get into the shelter because Russia continues shelling the area. However, it is presumed that all those inside have now died. Mariupol city hall said Friday the theatre was destroyed in a \u0027cynical\u0027 attack and claimed that Russia knew civilians were taking refuge in the building.Zelensky says nearly 100,000 people are trapped without food, water or power in the besieged city and enduring fierce shelling by Russian forces.The leader of Russia\u0027s southern republic of Chechnya said Thursday that forces from his region had taken control of Mariupol city hall and hoisted the Russian flag.   Mariupol has been the scene of some of the worst devastation of the war, which has seen Russia relentlessly besiege and pummel Ukraine\u0027s cities. The misery inside them is such that nearly anyone who can is trying to leave and those left behind face desperate food shortages in a country once known as the breadbasket for the world.In the shelled city of Kharkiv, mostly elderly women came to collect food and other urgent supplies. In the capital of Kyiv, ashes of the dead are piling up at the main crematorium because so many relatives have left, leaving urns unclaimed.For civilians unable to join the flood of refugees from Ukraine, the days of plenty in the country are becoming just a fading memory, as the war grinds into a second month.With Ukrainian soldiers battling Russia\u0027s invasion force to a near stalemate in many places and the president urging people to remain steadfast, the U.S. and the European Union announced a move to further squeeze Russia: a new partnership to reduce Europe\u0027s reliance on Russian energy and slowly squeeze off the billions of dollars the Kremlin gets from sales of fossil fuels."},{"url":null,"title":"Didnt message Drivers caught using phones wheel","story":"Share this article Announcing the new laws today, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \u0027I will do everything in my power to keep road-users safe, which is why I am taking a zero-tolerance approach to those who decide to risk lives by using their phone behind the wheel.\u0027I\u0027m ensuring anyone who chooses to break this vital law can face punishment for doing so, and we\u0027ll continue our efforts to ensure our roads remain among the safest in the world.\u0027 Simon Williams, road safety spokesman at RAC, added that a quarter of drivers are still making or receiving calls while driving.He said: \u0027Using a handheld mobile phone at the wheel is illegal and dangerous and, like drink-driving, ruins lives.\u0027Worryingly the RAC\u0027s research shows that a quarter of drivers are still making or receiving calls with a handheld phone while driving.\u0027Fortunately, the government has changed the law so that any use of a handheld device will automatically lead to six points and a £200 fine.\u0027Without a step-change in enforcement more will need to be done to make using a handheld mobile phone at the wheel as socially unacceptable as drink-driving.\u0027Inspector Craig Tatton, of Dorset Police\u0027s traffic unit, added: \u0027I would urge anyone who thinks it is OK to use a mobile phone while driving to seriously consider their actions.\u0027Using a mobile phone at the wheel is a distraction and can lead to tragic consequences.\u0027We are urging drivers to take responsibility for their actions and leave their phone alone.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Free speech legal supremacy Dominic Raab unveils plan stop democratic debate","story":"Share this article Harry Potter author JK Rowling and other public figures have been vilified for voicing concerns over an erosion of women’s rights by the transgender lobby, for example.Only this week, the creator of comedy series Father Ted Graham Linehan declared that he had been ‘thoroughly cancelled’ and that trans activists had cost him his family and his marriage. Recent years have seen cancel culture extend across society, with growing numbers attacked in public life, on university campuses and on social media for expressing their views.The author Jacqueline Wilson recently compared ‘scary’ cancel culture to ‘walking a tightrope’.Yesterday, Vladimir Putin tried to use the issue to score political points, suggesting the West was trying to ‘cancel’ Russia in the same way some have with JK Rowling.Mr Raab told the Mail that under plans being drawn up for the Bill of Rights, there would be only very limited restrictions placed on the new over-arching protections on free speech.He said it would be given a ‘different status in the pecking order of rights’, with checks to stop people abusing it to promote terrorism.Although the main impact of this will be on legal disputes, ministers believe that placing such a heavy emphasis on free speech is likely to have an effect beyond the courts and could help iniduals trying to push back against cancel culture.Mr Raab said: ‘We will still be clamping down on those who try and use either media or free speech to incite violence, to radicalise terrorists, or to threaten children. All of those safeguards will be in place.‘But we’ve got to be able to strengthen free speech, the liberty that guards all of our other freedoms, and stop it being whittled away surreptitiously, sometimes without us really being conscious of it.‘So it will have a different status in the pecking order of rights and I think that will go a long way to protecting this country’s freedom of speech and our history, which has always very strongly protected freedom of speech.’The Human Rights Act was introduced by Tony Blair’s Labour government 20 years ago, and Tory ministers believe it is ripe for reform. "},{"url":null,"title":"Duchess Cambridge looks world away afternoons wet regatta dazzles gown","story":"Dazzle like the Duchess in a gown by Phillipa LepleyTake a closer look here!We\u0026#39ve loved poring over the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s outfits throughout the Royals eight-day tour of the Caribbean.

We put all our grocery expenses on credit cards in order to conserve as much as we could from our salaries. Lockdown also meant we had nowhere else to be.’Even so, it wasn’t always ideal: after finishing his 7am-3pm shift for Ford (working from home), Ashok would decamp to his home hangar to crack on with plane assembly for hours at a time.‘Some of it is really tedious work — you have to spend hours preparing all the parts and there is a lot of repetition,’ he says. ‘I had a checklist that just got longer and longer — I think by the end it had a thousand items on it. And it’s stressful because there’s no second chances — you can’t really afford to make a mistake. So I did get tired.’His wife, meanwhile, felt the strain of home schooling and homeworking in what, for several months, became a de facto aircraft parts storage facility.‘Once the wings were assembled, they were in my kitchen diner for months,’ she says. ‘I had to swaddle them in duvets to make sure they didn’t get damaged by the kids, but there would be times when Ashok and I were both on work calls, Tara was home schooling on the laptop next to me and Diya was causing mayhem. There was an element of novelty at first but my patience did start to wear thin.’The couple persevered, though, and by April last year the main bodywork had been completed and the plane was ready to have its wings, engine and avionics fixed in place.These jobs were then done by certified experts at the airfield Sling uses as its UK distribution point.‘It would have been wonderful to put the wings on at home but we couldn’t have got it down the side entrance,’ says Abi with a grin.The wings were painted in May and in June, Ashok started the engine for the first time.‘That was a special moment,’ he says. ‘I looked at it and thought, “I made this” — and it did feel good, although at the same time I kept thinking about stuff that could go wrong.’ The Light Aircraft Authority must not only sign off on overall safety but also make regular inspections.Finally, at the end of November 2021, the freshly painted aircraft was signed off as airworthy, although it took a further two months for the paperwork to come through, so it was not until early February that Ashok could see the aircraft take to the skies, with Tim Hardy at the controls.‘After all those months of hard work it felt amazing,’ he says. ‘It was everything we had worked towards.’He needs to complete another four landings and a few hours with an instructor before he can take command himself, while Abi is also studying for her pilot’s licence so they can share the controls on those mini-breaks.Which raises the question — where will they go first? At the moment they are aiming for Newquay over the Bank Holiday weekend, with some European adventures in summer.As to the financial side, they want to get other pilots to buy shares in G-DIYA to spread the cost of future maintenance, while the ever-industrious Ashok is also looking at building a full-size hangar, closer to home.‘Space is at a premium in the South-East of England, so I have applied to the council to lease a plot and build my own hangar,’ he says.Abi rolls her eyes affectionately. She says she has nothing to complain about, even if there are some hefty credit card bills to pay off this year.After all, she no longer has a plane in her house — and the sky is now literally the limit. ‘We definitely had a productive lockdown,’ she says with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"Britains civil servant Simon Case quizzed Met Partygate investigation","story":"Share this article A source told the Financial Times: ‘Simon is totally compromised, he’s worried about being fined by the police – it’s widely known he is being investigated.

Dr Holohan has been chief medical officer since late 2008, and worked as deputy chief medical officer at the department since 2001.‘Lasting impact’During his time in the role, he dealt with the swine flu pandemic and also controversy following the emergence of the CervicalCheck scandal.As news of his move was confirmed, Mr Donnelly said: “Since his appointment as chief medical officer in December 2008, Dr Holohan has made a significant and lasting impact on health in Ireland.“Throughout the pandemic his invaluable advice to me, and to the Government, has shaped our response to Covid-19, and I witnessed first-hand his unwavering dedication to protecting the health of the people of Ireland,” he said.The Taoiseach also expressed gratitude for Dr Holohan’s efforts during his time as chief medical officer and, in particular, through the pandemic.“His steadfast, assured advice, and willingness to communicate over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, undoubtedly helped save lives and kept Ireland safe during an exceptionally challenging two years.“His work chairing the Nphet, his professionalism, and calm and personable nature gave us all the assurance we needed during the pandemic. I wish him and his family the very best of luck for the future,” he said.Wife’s deathDr Holohan’s wife, Emer Feely, died in February 2021 after a long illness. Dr Feely, a specialist in public health medicine and a medical graduate of UCD, had been battling a terminal form of blood cancer, multiple myeloma, since 2012.Dr Holohan took time out from his work duties to help with the care of his wife after she entered palliative care in July 2020.He said at the time that he wanted to give his “energy, attention and all of my time” to his wife and to their two teenage children. His role had been assumed by his deputy Dr Ronan Glynn until his return in October 2020.Separately, provost of Trinity Prof Linda Doyle said Dr Holohan would not be attached to a single school or discipline within Trinity.“Instead, his role will traverse the faculties of arts, humanities and social sciences and health sciences, recognising the complexity and scope of population health challenges in the modern era,” she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"tony holohan helped to win public backing needed in ireland s covid 19 response","story":"Dr Tony Holohan: As the public face of the fight against Covid-19, the Department of Health’s chief medical officer was lauded widely and at times elevated to near-sainthood at the height of the pandemic. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillEven by the extraordinary standards of the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Tony Holohan has had a tumultuous two years.As the public face of the fight against the virus, the Department of Health’s chief medical officer (CMO) was lauded widely and at times elevated to near-sainthood at the height of the crisis.Unflappable “Uncle Tony” filled the void left by a post-election political stalemate in early 2020, amid public concern as Covid-19 spread across the country.While the politicians dithered, Holohan pushed for the most swingeing lockdown Ireland had ever seen, in the name of restricting its spread.The daily National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) media briefings became required, but grim, viewing as cases multiplied and deaths soared.As the measured voice of science, he captured the broad swathe of public support needed to make the restrictions work. Cases shrank away to almost nothing and Holohan was made a freeman of Dublin.An ever-present in the early months of the crisis, Holohan had to check into hospital for a night after feeling “a bit funny” during one of the briefings.Then, in July 2020, he went on leave to care for his wife Emer, who was dying of cancer.Kept coming backAs we know now, Covid-19 kept changing and kept coming back. Holohan returned in the autumn after his wife’s death and further waves followed. The crisis lengthened from months into years, there were rows with newly assertive Ministers and the public grew tired of the pandemic and the misery it was inflicting.Some of the blame was directed at Nphet and Holohan, its chairman. There were disputes over issues such antigen tests, ventilation and mask wearing policy. The membership of Nphet, dominated by public servants, was seen as too narrow.The rollout of newly developed vaccines stuttered at first, but eventually came good. Ireland’s high take-up of vaccines is largely the result of the trust placed in Holohan and his officials.It helped that the Dublin-born, Limerick-raised doctor was 12 years in the role of chief medical officer by the time the pandemic kicked off.On his first week in the job in 2008, he was thrown into a public health crisis, dealing with the fallout from the pig-meat dioxins scandal. The following year, he had to manage the response to the global swine flu outbreak.In 2018, he found himself at the centre of controversy around the HSE’s failure to disclose incorrect results of old smear tests in the CervicalCheck screening programme to affected women and their families. There were calls from patient advocates on him and other senior health officials to resign.The then minister for health Simon Harris stood by Holohan but commissioned an external report on the scandal rather than taking up the CMO on his suggestion of an internal investigation.While the pandemic continues to this day, Holohan’s approach has relaxed considerably now that most of the population has been vaccinated.Favourable indicationsOnce, he was criticised by people for the length of Ireland’s lockdown now, surprise is expressed at how quickly he recommended the lifting of restrictions and how reluctant he has been to return to them when cases have again spiked.Ultimately, Holohan should be judged by how Ireland did in the crisis. That should be decided by an independent review or investigation, as is happening in other countries.The initial indications are favourable as Holohan prepares to leave his role as CMO and take up a job as Professor of Public Health Strategy and Leadership at Trinity College, Dublin, Earlier this month, a study published in The Lancet found Ireland had one of the lowest rates of excess deaths of any country during the pandemic.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":" checks for non irish entering ni says brandon lewis","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis met under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin. Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

Photograph: Liesa Koppitz-JohanssenBloombergTaoiseach Micheál Martin has played down comments by Ukrainian president Voldymyr Zelenskiy, who told EU leaders at the Brussels summit that Ireland was “almost” supporting Ukraine. The comments were contained in a transcript of Mr Zelenskiy’s speech, which was released overnight by the Ukrainian government.Mr Zelenskiy appeared to single out Ireland as a country that “almost” stands with Ukraine as it battles a Russian invasion, in an address to European Union leaders at the Brussels summit.The Ukrainian leader spoke to the 27 leaders over video call from Kyiv and thanked member states one by one for standing with Ukraine, in particular eastern and Baltic allies, saying “Lithuania stands for us. Latvia stands for us. Estonia stands for us. Poland stands for us.”But Ireland was among the member states he appeared to describe as not offering full support. “Ireland – well, almost,” Mr Zelenskiy said, according to a translation of his remarks released by the Kyiv government early on Friday.Micheál Martin spoke to reporters as he entered the summit venue for the second day of the meeting. “That wouldn’t have been my read of it. He was actually talking in terms of the European perspective ... I wouldn’t have taken the same slant that some may be taking from it.”Last night, speaking after the summit had concluded, Mr Martin again played down the Ukrainian president’s remarks, saying Mr Zelenskiy was fully aware of Ireland’s contributions to his country and grateful for them.“I think it’s been overstated, to be frank,” Mr Martin said. EU membershipMr Martin said he spoke to Mr Zelenskiy last week when he was in Washington and he had “a very comprehensive oversight of Ireland’s contributions, both in terms of even the 20 million humanitarian aid in terms of the peace facility, and also in terms of the humanitarian response”.He said that Mr Zelenskiy had “thanked me personally for our support of the Ukrainian European perspective”.Mr Martin said he had been “really strong in relation to supporting Ukraine’s membership of the European Union. I’ve consistently said this, and would be supportive of Lithuania and others, and I’ve argued that the whole application process is too slow.” “And obviously, I mean, one can surmise on one word, and I think we can over-interpret that as well, to be fair, because you know, our contact with the embassy of Ukraine in Dublin has been pretty clear,” Mr Martin said.The Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs on Friday evening publicly thanked Ireland for joining the The Group of Friends of Accountability, an informal forum of countries expressing an intent to ensure that international crimes perpetrated since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia a month ago be punished.Welcoming the move, Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said his government was “grateful to our Irish partners for joining the Group of Friends of Accountability today. Undoubtedly, Ireland is at the forefront within the EU and beyond providing essential support for Ukraine in all possible ways.”Waiving visasIreland also moved early to waive visas for Ukrainians before the EU moved as a whole and has sent humanitarian aid, with the Government repeatedly expressing full solidarity with the country.However, Mr Zelenskiy’s remarks may refer to Ireland’s decision not to send military aid to the country. The Government opted to send medical and humanitarian supplies alone, staying out of a joint €1 billion fund for arms for Ukraine supported by almost all other EU countries.The official Ukrainian transcript of Mr Zelenskiy’s speech translated the words as “well, almost”. However, the simultaneous translation while Mr Zelenskiy was speaking to the European Council translated as “well, practically”. This was referenced by the Taoiseach this morning when questioned on the issue. However, a Ukrainian speaker consulted by The  said the best translation was “well, almost” and that the sense of Mr Zelenskiy’s remarks was that Irish support for Ukraine was less vigorous than other countries."},{"url":null,"title":"biden shares pizza selfies and ballina anecdotes in poland","story":"US president Joe Biden meets members of the 82nd Airborne Division at the G2A Arena in Jasionka, near Rzeszów: He thanked them  “for all you do”. Photograph: Doug MillsSharing a slice of a pizza and a selfie with US soldiers, a smiling US president Joe Biden paid a symbolic visit on Friday to Rzeszów, in Poland’s southeast, a wartime frontline city twice over.A month after Russia’s invasion, Rzeszów, 80km from the Ukrainian border, has become a key\u0026nbspreception centre for weary refugees. Now the city’s international airport is becoming a principal hub for western humanitarian and military aid into Ukraine.\u0026nbspEarly last month, as Russia massed troops on Ukraine’s border, Biden deployed 1,700 members of the 82nd Airborne Division to Rzeszów as part of a wider deployment to Poland and Romania.Just\u0026nbspafter 2pm on Friday, he dropped into the city’s local stadium to say hello: first to a makeshift military barbershop and then on to a canteen where US paratroopers were enjoying a pizza lunch, with the compliments of the White House.“Well, if you’re starting to eat, I’m going to sit down and have something to eat,” said Biden, slipping in to grab a slice of pepperoni and jalapeno.Not a wise choice: the chilli made his eyes water and, dabbing his eyes with a napkin between sips of water, he began telling his captive audience an anecdote about his Irish great grandfather, Edward Blewitt, son of parents from Ballina.Turning to the war an hour’s drive away in Ukraine, Biden expressed his thanks to the paratroopers “for all you do” and called the US military “the finest fighting force in the history of the world”.Jet delay“This is not hyperbole,” he said several times during the 20-minute lunch at a table filled with pizza and US chocolate treats, the latter carrying the US presidential seal.This all-American encounter was supposed to be a bilateral affair with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. But an emergency landing of the Polish presidential jet meant Duda was delayed and not in Rzezów to meet his guest at Jasionka airport.Locals living nearby say they have seen a steady shift in recent weeks away from colourful commercial airliners from Brussels and London. Now the skies are dominated by bulky grey military transport planes, landing and leaving in rapid succession.Already these planes were bringing food and military supplies into Ukraine’s conflict-hit eastern regions. On Thursday, Nato leaders indicated they would add more high-tech equipment to deliveries, meaning this Polish town of 200,000 has gained new strategic significance. When the history of Russia’s war in Ukraine is written, the Rzezów airlift – and Biden’s visit on Friday – will be part of the story.After lunch with US paratroopers, Biden visited the local refugee reception centre. In just one month, more than 3.6 million people have fled Ukraine, according to the United Nations, and 60 per cent – 2.24 million by Friday – have arrived in Poland, where Rzeszów lies on one of the main arteries to Krakow.Refugees vs guestsBefore arriving, Biden promised “humanitarian assistance needed both inside and outside Ukraine” and\u0026nbspto arrange the relocation of 100,000 Ukrainians to the US. That was a response to a Polish request two weeks ago to visiting vice-president Kamala Harris, to speed up and simplify procedures allowing Ukrainians to join family members in the US.Finally joining the US president, Duda insisted his fellow Poles viewed the new arrivals “not as refugees, they’re our guests”.“I would like to thank all my compatriots who have opened their hearts and opened their homes to our neighbours and brothers from Ukraine, who are in a difficult position today, who are in need today,” he said.The Polish president said Biden’s presence “sends a great signal and is evidence of unity” among western alliesUS national security adviser Jake Sullivan, travelling with Biden, said the president was visiting a “frontline and very vulnerable ally”.Poland had not just “taken the brunt of the humanitarian impact” of the refugee flows from Ukraine, he said, it had also assisted the US surge to “defend and shore up the eastern flank” of Nato.Polish officials will be listening closely on Saturday to Biden’s address at Warsaw’s rebuilt royal palace. After a history burdened with betrayals and occupation, Poles are anxious for Biden to underline and strengthen security assurances already made – that the US will defend “every inch” of Nato territory.\u0026nbspStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"were zelenskiy s  about ireland lost in translation","story":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, via video link at the Bundestag in Berlin, Germany.

Today, though, she has a rather less desirable epithet, as “Russia’s Eva Braun”.Kabaeva, 38, is the former gymnast turned politician who is widely believed to be the girlfriend, or possibly the wife, of Vladimir Putin. She is even rumoured to have given birth to four children by the Russian president, though reports of any relationship between the two have always been denied by the Kremlin.As Putin commits ever greater atrocities in Ukraine, Kabaeva and her children are reportedly holed up in a Swiss chalet, facing growing demands to be extradited back to Russia.“It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer,” says a Change.org petition to the Swiss government signed by almost 64,000 people at the time of writing, comparing her to the woman who married Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker the day before they both took their own lives.Opponents of Putin believe Kabaeva is in hiding near Lugano, a quiet lakeside city known for its celebrated chocolate museum, though there is no proof she is even in Switzerland. Other reports place her in an underground bunker in Siberia’s Altai Mountains.Needless to say, facts about Putin’s private life are hard to pin down. One thing we do know is that the 69-year-old dictator is orced from his first wife, Lyudmila Shkrebneva, which was confirmed in 2014, six years after Kabaeva was first romantically linked with Putin.“I have a private life in which I do not permit interference,” Putin has said. “It must be respected.” He has also criticised “those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into other people’s lives”.This, though, has done little to quell the rumours, according to which Kabaeva continues to be Russia’s secret first lady, paid a £7.7 million salary for her job controlling a pro-Kremlin media group.Dr Elisabeth Schimpfössl, a senior lecturer at Aston University and author of Rich Russians: From Oligarchs to Bourgeoisie, says she has heard rumours that “Vladimir Putin and Alina live together in the Kremlin”. There are plenty of clues that point to a long-term relationship between the two, and to the origins of Putin’s interest in her, dating back to at least 2008 and possibly much earlier.Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 1983, Kabaeva’s father was a professional footballer and her mother played basketball for the national side, but she is said to have left her roots firmly in the past once success came her way. Kabaeva is said to have started rhythmic gymnastics at the age of five, and her parents took her to Moscow where she was taken under the wing of Irina Viner, a former Soviet-era coach.By the age of 13 she was competing for Russia, and she went on to win 14 world championship medals, 21 European championship medals and Olympic gold at the 2004 Athens Games. A doping conviction in 2001 saw her stripped of the world title she had won that year.The source who knew her when she was in her early 20s said she lived at the time in a “modest and quite Soviet” flat near the Central Moscow Hippodrome, decorated with small glass ornaments, and described her as “a sweet girl – simple, nice and friendly”. She seemed to want companionship more than anything. “I think she’d been put in that flat and it was quite new that she was living on her own, rather than living with her mother, who was pretty involved,” says the source.At the time, Kabaeva had a boyfriend, a Moscow-based policeman originally from Georgia, who “overnight became a colonel and got promoted wildly up the ranks”, says the source. “She talked to me about him and looked quite proud.”Her confidence clearly grew in line with her success as a gymnast. She became so popular that a Russian pop band recorded a song about her entitled Alina. Nor was she particularly modest about her talents. “Being a star in gymnastics is not just about skill,” she told one interviewer, “It is also about personality. Look at me. I don’t want to be rude, but everyone wants to be like Alina Kabaeva.”Dr Schimpfössl says it was through sport rather than politics that Kabaeva met Putin. Viner, who married the oligarch Alisher Usmanov, introduced them, she says. In 2001, Putin was pictured beside Kabaeva as he awarded her an Order of Friendship (a state decoration) at the Kremlin.Kabaeva’s relationship with the Georgian policeman reportedly ended in 2005 amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her life. She is on record as saying subsequently she had met a man who “I love very much”, adding: “Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared.” Described as Russia’s most flexible woman, she retired from gymnastics after 2004, but made a brief comeback in 2007, by which time her sights were firmly set on politics. It was in that year that Kabaeva was elected to the State Duma, representing the pro-Putin United Russia party.The source next saw her in 2008, by which point Kabaeva’s life appeared to have changed dramatically. The source was attending an awards ceremony in Russia, where Putin himself was present. “We had a massive formal dinner and afterwards I looked over and saw this girl in a white Grecian dress and realised, ‘Oh my God, it’s Alina,” she says.She was shocked by how much weight Kabaeva had gained, but a fellow guest told her, “Well, she’s pregnant.” He also told her Kabaeva was in a relationship with Putin.  The source witnessed no physical interaction between the gymnast and Putin that evening, but she noticed the attention Kabaeva was attracting from others: “There was a circle of people staring at her as she twirled around.” Her career had branched into modelling and hosting a television chat show called Steps to Success, and in 2014 she announced she was quitting parliament to take control of the pro-Kremlin National Media Group. In November last year, The Insider, a Russian investigative journalism website, reported she was paid an annual salary of 785 million roubles (£7.7 million), basing the figure on leaked tax records for 2018.She is reported to have been seen wearing a wedding ring and there have been claims she and Putin married in the Iversky Monastery in the Valdai hills between Moscow and St Petersburg.Rumour has it that she gave birth to a son by Putin, named Dima after one of the president’s close friends, followed by a daughter and then twins, all of whom are said to have Swiss passports. In 2015, Switzerland’s Bick tabloid reported Putin had flown to Switzerland to be with Kabaeva as she went into labour at the private Clinic Sant’Anna near Lugano, although Putin’s spokesman insisted that “information about the birth of a baby fathered by Vladimir Putin does not correspond to reality”. The twins are said to have been born in 2018, after which Kabaeva disappeared from public view for almost three years.She resurfaced last August, appearing on a state television channel to criticise Tokyo judges who deprived Russian star Dina Averina of gold in rhythmic gymnastics.In December, as tension between Russia and Ukraine ramped up, it was reported she was seen dancing at a party in Moscow’s Voskhod restaurant, not far from the Kremlin, resplendent in a glittering gold dress. The party followed an experimental rhythmic gymnastics international tournament called Divine Grace, which she herself had organised.In keeping with the status that she would command as Putin’s wife, she reportedly has a fleet of limousines at her disposal and has made visits to a Moscow café surrounded by security guards armed with machine guns.If she has indeed decamped to Switzerland lately, it is unclear how long she might remain. “Please decide whether the residence of this inidual in your country is warranted,” implores the petition to the Swiss government. “It’s time Switzerland takes action.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine will not give up territory as the price of peace, says Volodymyr ZelenskyUkrainian forces launch counter-offensive in Russian-controlled KhersonBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardDuke and Duchess of Cambridge brave the rain in Bahamas regatta as Prince William wins bragging rightsRussians prepare to scale back invasion of UkraineWhy the Kremlin’s apparent retreat could be Ukraine’s moment of maximum perilMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt discovered surprise leadership campaign really did","story":"It is the day after the Chancellor’s spring statement, and Jeremy Hunt needs just one word to sum up what he thinks Rishi Sunak should be most worried about: growth.Quite apart from the cost of living crisis that is dominating all of our bank balances, Hunt warns that if the current growth forecasts prove accurate, “then it’s going to become very difficult to fund the growth in NHS and social care spending and the growth in defence spending that we need and that the public want”.The former foreign, health, and culture secretary believes the 2024 election will be fought on economic and foreign policy issues, and both Boris Johnson and Sunak would be well advised to keep an eye on a man who still harbours ambitions of leading the Conservative Party into that battle.With the Partygate investigation still hanging over the Prime Minister and Sunak’s popularity taking a battering this week, there remains an outside chance that the Tories will be looking for a new leader before the country next goes to the polls, and Hunt, who came a distant second to Johnson in the 2019 leadership contest, stands ready to pick up the baton should it fall to the floor.“I discovered slightly to my surprise during the leadership campaign that I really did want the job,” he says, “and I was really excited about what I might do if I became prime minister.”He pulls out the traditional platitudes about life on the backbenches being “incredibly rewarding”, of the joy of spending “more time both focused on my constituency and with my family”, of being able to “cycle with my kids to school every morning”, before concluding: “The ambition hasn’t vanished but it has dimmed somewhat.”A “dimmed” ambition is still an ambition, and any MP who veers away from the official line that we already have a prime ministerthey are doing a terrific jobthere is no vacancy is declaring themself as a would-be PM. Hunt’s corner office in Portcullis House, the parliamentary annexe over the road from Big Ben, is filled with reminders of his former selves: framed photos of him with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Victoria Beckham from his days as culture secretary a set of six Russian dolls depicting Hunt and his five predecessors as health secretary a felt-tip pen picture of a mother and child drawn for him by Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s daughter Gabriella when he was foreign secretary.“I think there is something very addictive about being in the room where it happens,” he ventures, “and it’s an incredible privilege to sit at the Cabinet table and to sit at the National Security Council meetings and discuss extraordinarily important issues, and I won’t say there haven’t been moments when I haven’t thought it would be really interesting to be in there and be part of those really really big decisions.”He has also spent lockdown writing two books, one on health policy and one on foreign policy (another classic trope of the would-be leader), saying he wants to see if there is a “space” in politics and on bookshelves for an “honest and reflective account” of what went well and what went badly for him.Maybe even a “space” in Number 10, I ask, for a politician who is prepared to admit to their mistakes?“Ah, you’re so good at this aren’t you,” he laughs, changing the subject.Is it, though, time to start taking Hunt more seriously as a future PM? The 55-year-old was outshone by Boris Johnson in the leadership campaign, and as a remainer he never really stood a chance, but Brexit is no longer the dominant force in politics, and if Johnson should fall, Sunak no longer appears the shoo-in he was just a few weeks ago. Hunt will also be encouraged by the fact that in Tory leadership contests, the front runner rarely wins, opening up the possibility that he could be the “safe pair of hands” to which the party turns after turbulent times, in the same way that John Major was unexpectedly chosen to succeed Margaret Thatcher.During our interview he subtly distances himself from potential leadership rivals and their policies, damning them with faint praise or picking holes in their performance.Sunak’s spring statement was “a significant package”, he says, and he deserved “more credit” for making sure two thirds of people will not be paying more tax when National Insurance goes up. There is, though, a very large “but”.“The thing that worried me most in the forecasts he announced is the big reductions in growth rates, and that received less focus from the media than it deserved,” he says. “I think the really urgent challenge now is to find ways to boost our growth.”As well as having nine years of Cabinet experience, Hunt is an entrepreneur who co-founded Hotcourses, the educational listings firm that was sold in 2017 for £30.1 million. So he knows all about the importance of economic growth from both a policy and a boardroom viewpoint.The Office for Budget Responsibility cut its expectations for GDP growth this week, from 6 per cent to 3.8 per cent this year, then just 1.8 per cent in 2023 and 2.1 per cent in 2024, while inflation is expected to peak at 8.7 per cent this winter.Sunak has faced criticism for failing to spell out how he will promote growth, quite apart from the accusations of muddled thinking over his fiscal policies and reports of an ideological struggle between Number 10 and 11 that contributed to the underwhelming spring statement.There is an opportunity, then, for a politician with laser focus on growth to build a following. What does Hunt think the Tories need to do to win in 2024?“We have been through a rocky period for sure, with all the Partygate allegations, but at elections people look forward, not back. We need to be the party that is going to keep people safe at home and abroad and have the best policies for helping people get through tough times economically. “I think that is going to be the big question going into the next election – do people feel our plan for the economy is going to be the one that is going to get the country back on track?”Hunt also distances himself from Priti Patel’s Ukrainian refugee policy (“We took too long to get the right policies in place”) but it is another potential leadership contender, Health Secretary Sajid Javid (and, by association, Johnson) who gets the biggest beasting.“We are failing badly on workforce training,” he says. “We have vacancies in nearly every speciality across the NHS. On Wednesday the Government is set to vote down the most innocuous amendment possible, that I proposed in the House of Commons. “All it does is ask for independent projections to be made every couple of years as to the number of doctors we’re going to need in 10 or 20 years time, and the Government is so scared of it, because I think they know that it’s going to tell them we’re not training enough doctors and nurses for the future.“People are working so hard on the front line, they know that there is no magic bullet to this, they know it takes seven years to train a doctor, three years to train a nurse, we can’t go on importing them from overseas because there is a global shortage of medical professionals, so they’re not expecting an immediate solution but they would like to know there’s a long term solution in place, and we’re denying them that by saying we’re not even prepared to have regular independent estimates of the numbers of doctors and nurses we should be training in the future. It’s a massive slap in the face for people on the NHS front line, after they have worked so hard in the pandemic.”What, though, of Hunt’s own time as health secretary, and in other government departments? Is he the safe pair of hands he would have us believe?During his six years as health secretary, he ran a full-scale simulation of what would happen if the country was gripped by a pandemic, to make sure the UK was fully prepared. So what went wrong?Exactly two years after Britain’s first full day in lockdown, Hunt sips an espresso as he says: “I have to take responsibility for the fact that I was part of a groupthink that persisted for decades, which basically said that if we were going to have a pandemic it was likely to be a flu pandemic.“So we made extensive preparations for a flu pandemic. And when the pandemic came it wasn’t a flu pandemic, it was coronavirus.”I ask if he believes that deaths could have been avoided if he had made better decisions, rather than the “assumptions” he admits to.“There was never any advice that I overruled or didn’t follow as to what we should be doing in terms of our pandemic preparations,” he says. “It’s not something you can make a simple judgement on about how well we did – there were a whole bunch of things we got wrong and things we got right.”Hunt, it must be said, moved on from the Department of Health two years before the pandemic struck, but his actions as health secretary will be examined by the forthcoming Covid inquiry, and his protestations that he was simply following advice might not look much like leadership when they are subjected to a forensic deconstruction.Exercise Cygnus, the three-day pandemic simulation carried out across Government departments in 2016, “made no mention of testing at all”, Hunt concedes, “because testing is not relevant in a flu pandemic”.Among the deficiencies flagged up by Cygnus were the need for more ventilators and more personal protective equipment, yet when the pandemic came Britain found itself scrambling for both, with well-documented consequences.“All of the recommendations that were made to ministers following Cygnus were actioned,” Hunt says, “and indeed when it came to ventilators we did find the ventilators we needed when it came to PPE we had the central stockpile.”That might well jar with NHS staff and care workers who had to buy their own PPE or make it out of bin bags. Hunt says Britain needs to learn from places like Hong Kong, which mandated a three-month stockpile of PPE for care homes, but surely Hunt could have done that too?“I’m not saying for a moment there aren’t lessons to be learned, but if you’re saying ‘did ministers fail to implement what they were asked to do’, absolutely not.“As a health secretary you follow the advice that’s made, the recommendations that’s made to you by your officials, and everything that they asked me to do after Operation Cygnus, I did.Hunt says that during his year as foreign secretary – the last under Theresa May – getting Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other British detainees in Iran home was his “number one priority” but it took “too long” to free her. He insists he personally could not have done more, and points the finger at the Treasury and at the Ministry of Defence (run by Gavin Williamson in Hunt’s time, then by Ben Wallace) for dragging their heels.“Nazanin is right to ask the question why did it take six years to resolve all the issues that were keeping a British citizen in prison totally unjustifiably, or in Anushi (Decimal)’s case five years. I think we do need to ask ourselves the searching question as to whether we could have dealt with that issue more quickly.” As to whether he also faces “searching questions”, he says: “The issue isn’t about an inidual foreign secretary, it’s about the fact that there were three government departments that needed to align to make this happen, MoD, the Treasury and the Foreign Office, and those things always do take time.” Liz Truss (another prime ministerial hopeful) deserves “great credit” for getting the job done, he says.Recent suggestions that attempts to free the Iranian prisoners were effectively vetoed by the US are dismissed by Hunt. “There were always ways we could pay that debt if we wanted to, without going through a bank that might mean it would end up being sanctioned by the United States. President Obama, when he settled an American debt, flew a crateload of dollar bills over to Tehran Airport, so there are always ways you can solve these things, but it does take time.”As a man who had to get into the mind of Vladimir Putin during his time at the Foreign Office, Hunt can offer only grim predictions about the direction of the war in Ukraine.“I think it’s going to end absolutely horrifically,” he says. “I think it’s unfortunately going to take a long time for Putin to realise that he cannot win, and I think the Ukrainians have humbled us all into showing that freedom, which I think we had started to take for granted in the West, is something worth fighting and giving up your life for, and it is an existential battle for them, so they will fight to the end, and that means I’m afraid this is going to last a very long time.”On the subject of whether we could see nuclear, chemical or biological weapons being used by Russia, he says: “I fear we will. Putin is a sociopath who has shown no hesitation about using or authorising the use of the most brutal weapons, and we need to make it absolutely clear that there will be a response from the West to any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons inside Ukraine.”He does have praise for the Prime Minister’s response to the crisis, saying he has shown that “post-Brexit Britain can play a really central role in defending security and the rule of law internationally… many countries were worried that Brexit might signal some kind of retreat and British isolationism, and I think Ukraine has shown them that in fact the opposite is the case.”It is, though, on the subject of health that the fire is stoked in Hunt’s belly. His new book, Zero: Eliminating Preventable Harm and Tragedy in the NHS, is published in May, and it will be filled with righteous fury at the nonchalance with which this country treats avoidable deaths.He says he was “perplexed” when he became health secretary at the collective shrug over wasted lives, “in a way that we would never accept in the airline industry, or the oil industry, or the nuclear industry”.The NHS sees almost 8,000 avoidable deaths every year, “the equivalent of a plane falling out of the sky every week”, and Hunt believes the root cause is “a blame culture in the NHS that makes it very difficult for people to learn from mistakes”.He says doctors are “terrified of being fired or being hauled in front of the GMC or being made a scapegoat by their hospital if they are open about something that’s gone wrong”, and believes only a wholesale culture change in which healthcare staff can be up front about their mistakes will solve the issue.He has also talked recently about the “Uberisation” of general practice, “where you see the same doctor with the frequency that you would see the same Uber driver” and cites a study in Norway that showed people who see the same family doctor over many years are 25 per cent less likely to die prematurely.“If you believe in the NHS, as I do,” he says, “then we’ve got to show people that it isn’t just the fairest system in the world but it’s also the safest and highest quality healthcare system in the world.“We can make it that, but we need more doctors and nurses for a start, we should go back to people having their own doctors, and we should stop making people scapegoats when they’re honest and transparent about things going wrong.”As chairman of parliament’s health and social care select committee, Hunt will not find himself kicking his heels should his ambitions for the top job founder.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine will not give up territory as the price of peace, says Volodymyr ZelenskyUkrainian forces launch counter-offensive in Russian-controlled KhersonBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardDuke and Duchess of Cambridge brave the rain in Bahamas regatta as Prince William wins bragging rightsRussians prepare to scale back invasion of UkraineWhy the Kremlin’s apparent retreat could be Ukraine’s moment of maximum perilMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"le pen gains macron french presidential race tightens final","story":"Emmanuel Macron’s lead has slipped two weeks before the French presidential election, with far-Right leader Marine Le Pen and Left-wing firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon both making gains in the race for a place in the run-off.Mr Macron still has a comfortable lead ahead of the two-round vote on April 10 and April 24, and is on track to become the first French president to win re-election since Jacques Chirac.The latest IFOP daily poll places Mr Macron on 28.5 per cent of voter intentions for the first round, ahead of Ms Le Pen on 20 per cent and Mr Mélenchon on 14 per cent.Support for Valérie Pécresse, the hope of the mainstream Right, has meanwhile slipped to 11.5 per cent, neck-and-neck with extreme-Right polemicist Éric Zemmour.Mr Macron has benefited from a sizeable bump in his ratings since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with voters largely backing his efforts to find a way out of the conflict.But the “rally round the flag” effect has started to wear off. The president has dropped down 1.5 points over the past week, according to IFOP, although he remains four points up from his position before the start of the war.“Macron is complacent,” charged Philippe Marlière, Professor of French and European politics at University College London.“He hasn’t been seen much on the campaign trail. There are reasons for that – he’s the incumbent president, he’s very busy, notably with the war in Ukraine. However, the nearer we get to election day, I think that may be a problem.”Mr Marlière predicted that the president’s share of the vote could ultimately come in well below the current 28-30 per cent predicted by pollsters as voters flock to candidates who have gone to more effort to explain their policy platforms.Meanwhile, the wind is back in the sails of Ms Le Pen, who is up 2.5 points in the IFOP poll compared to a week earlier.The leader of the Rassemblement National has clawed back some of the support she had lost to Mr Zemmour, scooping up votes from those unhappy with his previous outspoken support for Vladimir Putin.Ms Le Pen has also spent months campaigning on cost of living measures, which has resonated with voters as the Ukrainian conflict drives fuel and food prices ever higher.A repeat of the 2017 election, pitting Mr Macron against Ms Le Pen in the run-off, remains the most likely scenario. But Mr Mélenchon, a veteran Left winger, is hoping to trigger an upset.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine will not give up territory as the price of peace, says Volodymyr ZelenskyUkrainian forces launch counter-offensive in Russian-controlled KhersonBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardDuke and Duchess of Cambridge brave the rain in Bahamas regatta as Prince William wins bragging rightsRussians prepare to scale back invasion of UkraineWhy the Kremlin’s apparent retreat could be Ukraine’s moment of maximum perilMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tennis fans ask pictures patrol russia isnt happy","story":"“I quit tennis two months ago, but it feels like years,” says Sergiy Stakhovsky, who, in January was gracing the courts of the Australian Open in Melbourne. “I watch videos of the guys playing on social media and it just seems so far away.” Over Zoom from the shelter in Kyiv where his army unit is staying, Stakhovsky looks tired. Wherever he is – he can’t say exactly – it is dark, and his long face is lit by the screen, earbuds oddly white in the gloom. There are heavy bags under his eyes. The energy of his other recent media appearances has given way to exhaustion. It has been a long few weeks. By day, Stakhovsky, 36, is just another soldier, one of the hundreds of thousands of civilians who have found themselves in terrifying and unfamiliar situations over the past month. Clutching Kalashnikovs and swaddled in flak jackets, he and his unit patrol the Ukrainian capital, conducting checks, helping transport vital resources across the city and reassuring the local populace, ready to fight if the enemy appears. Then, as soon as he gets back to base, he is once again Sergei Stakhovsky, the famous Ukrainian tennis player, using his status to do whatever he can for the war effort. Although he is proud to serve in uniform, he knows he can pull levers others cannot. There are interviews to be given in his fluent English, political requests to make, fundraising efforts to be supported. Before we speak he has been working to refocus his cancer foundation to offer more direct humanitarian aid. “It helps that I’m fit, but you can’t pick up soldiering in three weeks,” he says. “You can’t play tennis for a weekend and play in a tournament. I’m not going to be much use on the frontline. Maybe as a last defence. But I can’t just be patrolling when I know I can do so much more. On patrol I have three hours without my phone, but then the requests come pouring in. It can be hard to focus when you’re trying to do too many things at the same time. But I can’t complain. I’m not on the frontline. I’m not sitting in a bunker or being shelled.”  His comrades has grown used to the their famous new member, but sometimes the public are surprised, much as a Brit might be were they to encounter Andy Murray in fatigues on Oxford Street.“People do sometimes ask for pictures when we’re on patrol, which is not ideal,” Stakhovsky says. “The Russians aren’t happy with me, and if the pictures went up on social media they might know where I was. We patrol in different areas every day.” Keeping busy helps him to keep his mind off other questions, like wondering if he will ever see his family again. A month ago, Stakhovsky was on a family holiday in Dubai. He had just brought to an end a career that had seen him rise to number 31 in the world rankings, collect more than £3.8 million in prize money and win four titles. British fans may remember him for his performance at Wimbledon in 2013, when Stakhovsky, then ranked 116th, knocked Roger Federer out in the second round, in four sets of exquisite serve-and-volley tennis. At 36, Stakhovsky was looking forward to other projects. He was working with President Zelensky on a scheme to develop Ukrainian players before the 2022 Olympics in Paris. Then there was the small vineyard in western Ukraine, near the Hungarian border, where he makes a small range of wines. Above all, after a career spent on the road, he would have more time to spend with Anfisa and their three children, Nikifor, Alex, and Taisia. When Putin invaded, Stakhovsky had to make the most difficult decision of his life. He dropped his family off in Budapest, enlisted in the Ukrainian reserves and made his way back towards Kiev, where his father and brother were already working as doctors. He had spent most of his adult life outside Ukraine, which did not offer much support for young tennis players, but he had always loved playing Davis Cup for Ukraine. Seeing his country “so united, so eager to resist,” he felt a surge of patriotism. His mind was made up.  “Leaving my wife and kids was the hardest journey I’ve ever had to take,” he says. “I settled all my things at home: bank accounts, insurances. I know my family is taken care of. As we crossed the border I wondered if I would ever be coming back. It’s a step into the unknown. But it’s not heroic. I’ve not done anything remarkable. Not doing it was also something I wouldn’t have been able to live with. I want to help my children to grow and put them on their feet. But I want them to live in a world which is free and democratic which has no war, and where evil is not allowed to roll over Ukraine.” The packed schedule helps keep darker thoughts at bay, he adds. “I try to fill my days, because otherwise your mind starts to drift. You start thinking of all the pros and cons of you being there, wondering what’s going to happen next. Are the Russians going to shell, or bomb, or not bomb? Is the siren about to go off to send you to a shelter? There are moments every day when I regret coming, but that was part of the decision I made. I came here as a last resort.” He speaks to Anfisa sometimes. “She understands, or tries to,” he says. “There are better days and worse days.” But after a couple of conversations with his children after he arrived, he now finds it too difficult. “I can’t really emotionally handle talking to the kids. They don’t know what a war is. They just don’t know why their father is not home.” Although she is a naturalised Hungarian, Anfisa is originally Russian – but there is no question of ided loyalties. “We both understand that Russia started this war, that they invaded a free Ukraine and started killing innocent civilians.” There are lighter moments in the darkness. He and Anfisa lived in London for four years between 2009 and 2019, while she was studying at Imperial College, a time he remembers fondly. “Culturally it’s one of the best cities I’ve lived in, but it’s extremely expensive,” he says, laughing for the first time in the conversation. “You can only live there if you’re in the top 50.” The tennis world has been united in its support. He has spoken with Novak Djokovic, who was a boy in Belgrade during the Nato bombing in 1999, about the experience of being under fire. He’s had messages of support from many top players, including Andy Murray. “The guys have been great,” he says. “Andy and I had our differences sometimes, but he has been a class act.” Even the toughest sanctions will not repel the invaders on the ground. For that, he says, Ukraine needs harder forms of support. “We need weapons to clear the Russians to the border. We’re not just talking about NLAWs, which I have actually been taught how to use – thank you to the British for sending them – but air defence systems, tanks, armoured personnel carriers. We have an army of people with Kalashnikovs, bulletproof vests and helmets. But that’s it. We have almost no aviation. Our tank numbers are falling. There are no armoured vehicles to transport troops around. Russia will not take our resistance lightly. They might use all the weapons they have, nuclear or chemical. I don’t want to see my city, Kyiv, in ruins like Mariupol.“Ukraine will resist,” he says. “But to win we need the world’s help.” More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine will not give up territory as the price of peace, says Volodymyr ZelenskyUkrainian forces launch counter-offensive in Russian-controlled KhersonBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardDuke and Duchess of Cambridge brave the rain in Bahamas regatta as Prince William wins bragging rightsRussians prepare to scale back invasion of UkraineWhy the Kremlin’s apparent retreat could be Ukraine’s moment of maximum perilMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"10 mini budget graphs expose","story":" mini-Budget graphs that expose just how horrying the cost of living crisis isChancellor Rishi Sunaks Spring Statement had the usual cycle of a glossy sheen giving way to disappointment.

But what sets this one apart is the sheer scale of the crisis hitting Brits. whose disposable incomes will see the sharpest fall since records began in . The millionaire Chancellor promised to help families with skyrocketing prices through a p fuel duty cut now, and a big rise in National Insurance thresholds in July.It’s £bn of tax cuts - but analysis shows it’s a drop in the ocean, as inflation soars close to % and the tax burden still rises overall between now and . The Resolution Foundation also slammed the Chancellor for giving £ out of every £ to the wealthier half, as there’s no new increase to benefits or cash help for energy bills. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Boris Johnson said “it will continue to be tough, it will continue to be chippy, but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout”.But what do the charts from his own Treasury, watchdogs, and independent think tanks say  We’ve taken a look at  that highlight the enormity of the problems facing the economy... Inflation is rocketing to a -year high  Inflation is due to rocket to .% on average in   and could peak at nearly %. The Office for Budget Responsibility said the rise “will erode real incomes and consumption”, slashing GDP growth from a % forecast to .% this year. This graph highlights just how steeply inflation has climbedbeyond what experts thought it would hit five months ago , due to the Ukraine-Russia war. This will be the highest inflation in the history of the OBR, which was set up in .  This graph from the Office for Budget Responsibility shows the same inflation data but going back to . It shows inflation will peak above the .% it hit in  andto levels not seen since the early s. Disposable incomes will suffer the biggest drop since the s - at least  Brits’ household disposable incomes per person will fall .% in real terms in -, due to inflation outstripping wages. That is the biggest fall in a single year since records began in . And this is even after factoring in £ support for energy bills, the temporary cut in fuel duty and rise in National Insurance thresholds. The Office for Budget Responsibility said this help announced since October has offset around a third of the fall in living standards.

This chart shows the same data but with a longer timescale, showing how debt was more than double Britain’s GDP after the Second World War - but fell steadily as the decades rolled on.

Boris Johnson claimed the Chancellor had “cut taxes for working people by, I think, the biggest single amount for the last  years.” The IFS said this is technically true. But IFS Director Paul Johnson said: “He can now expect to raise more in tax as a share of national income by  than he expected last October.

The telegenic Chancellor was praised for the generosity of the furlough scheme and his slick performances at the Covid press conferences. Sunak is now discovering that popularity can be as superficial as the images on his Instagram account. His Spring Statement did not just land badly, it belly-flopped. There was nothing extra to help people with the cost of living, an additional .million people will be dragged into poverty and workers are going to be hit with higher taxes. Those who had shares in Sunak are now trying to offload them before then reach the status of a Russian rouble. The fall in Sunak’s stock seems to have happened overnight. But the Chancellor’s downfall has been in the making ever since he stepped into Number . He was presented by his slick PR machine as a slightly nerdy guy who wears a hoodie to work, has a nice haircut and wouldn’t offend your motheryou brought him round to dinner.  He was a safe pair of hands whose grasp of detail and measured manner offered a reassuring contrast to the bumbling, chaotic style of Boris Johnson. That’s what made him an appealing prospect for many voters - especially moderate conservatives - as a potential future leader. But beneath the soft-speaking and cosy leisurewear was a Thatcherite Tory, whose privileged upbringing, private education and vast family wealth has apparently left him struggling to understand the real world.For example, the Government was today forced to admit the Chancellor had borrowed a Kia Rio from a Sainsbury’s garage employee for a staged photo of him filling up with petrol with a broad grin. Downing Street said he paid for the petrol himself. In an interview yesterday morning, Mr Sunak said the food item where he’d most notice a price increase was bread, because “we have all dferent breads in my house.” The gaffe led to him being branded “Rishi Antoinette” on Twitter.  And the same day, footage emerged of Mr Sunak apparently struggling to pay for a tiny can of Coca-Cola in a shop, because he kept trying to tap his contactless card on the bar code reader. He once in an interview described himself as a “massive Coke addict” - which he quickly claried, meant the drink. But he also revealed he was a cola snob, and prefers the formula only available by importing bottles from Mexico. He won’t touch the Diet or Zero ieties. Evidence of his expensive tastes doesn’t end there.  Photos ahead of his first budget in March  saw him pose up with a £ bluetooth coffee mug, which can be temperature controlled from an app on his phone. It’s been claimed the Chancellor’s favourite snack is a truffle-flavoured crisp made by Torres, which costs as much as £ a bag from posh department store Fortnum and Mason’s.  In pictures released before his  budget in October, the Chancellor was shown wearing £ designer flip flops made by LA brand Palm Angels and sold in Selfridge’s. And he revealed in  that he starts the day with a ride on his £, Peloton exercise bike, where he enjoys online classes hosted by Instagram-friendly New York trainer Cody Rigsby.  In December , just days after freezing public sector pay for millions of workers, the Mirror revealed he had dined with his we, Akshata Murthy, at Mayfairaposs  Hertford Street - known as Londonaposs most secretive private membersapos club. The Mirror understands Mrs Murthy - whose vast wealth reportedly puts her higher up the rich list than the Queen - planned to hold a surprise party for Mr Sunak’s th birthday at the same private club in , but Covid- restrictions got in the way. Mrs Murthy’s business interests came under the spotlight today amid questions about whether Mr Sunak’s family had benefited from interests in Russia.  Mr Sunak was forced to deny profiting from Vladimir Putin’s regime, after being asked about Mrs Murthy’s reported stake in Infosys, an IT firm founded by her billionaire father N.R. Narayana Murthy. Just last week, Mr Sunak warned businesses to “think carefully” about making investments in Russia. But unlike other ministers, Mr Sunak has resisted calls to declare his we’s shareholdings on the Register of Members’ Interests. He insists he “followed the ministerial code to the letter.”  And Mr Sunak’s decision making was called into question long before his failure to deliver help for working families in Wednesday’s mini-Budget. Analysis found his “Eat Out to Help Out” campaign failed to deliver a long-term boost to struggling restaurants and cafes, knocked sideways by the pandemic. Studies did suggest, however, that it helped to push up infections - with the scheme linked to a spike of between  and %.

Families across the country are worried about rising food and fuel costs, soaring inflation and rocketing energy bills. A bold Chancellor would have seized this opportunity to deliver a new economic deal for the British people. Instead we got some tinkering with the tax system and a promise of more support further down the line. When families needed shelter from the economic downpour, the Chancellor offered the equivalent of raising a cocktail umbrella in the middle of a hurricane. Almost all the indicators on the economic dashboard are flashing red.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Growth forecasts have been slashed, inflation is set to rise to a -year high and the country is set for the biggest fall in living standards since . What support Mr Sunak did provide was either too paltry to make a signicant dference, such as the cut in fuel duty, or a piece of fiscal sleight of hand. Nothing The raising of the National Insurance threshold and the promised cut in income tax will not compensate for the tax hikes coming into force next month. Overall, the tax burden is set to rise to its highest level since the Second World War. Mr Sunak’s claim to be a low-tax Chancellor is as absurd as his claim he was “standing by” families during the cost-of-living crisis. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThere was no extra support to help people with energy bills even though they are set to increase by £, on average by this autumn. And there was nothing to help pensioners, the very low-paid and those on social security. Mr Sunak is condemning more people to poverty and more people to choose between heating and eating. Despite Conservative claims that the age of austerity is over, our public services will now receive less funding than originally announced. There will be less money for health, for schools, councils, and the armed forces. People looked to the Chancellor yesterday for help and reassurance. He delivered a financial statement that leaves only anxiety and trepidation.

A typical working-age household will see their real income fall % next year - a loss of £,, the Resolution Foundation think tank said. Absolute poverty - rather than relative poverty - is crucial because it is the measure Boris Johnson chooses to use.In  the PM controversially boasted poverty had fallen when relative poverty was up and absolute poverty was down. It comes after the Budget watchdog said soaring inflation - expected to nudge % in a four-decade high - will inflict the biggest disposable income drop since records began in the s. And today the Foundation warned poorer Brits will be hit harder as the Tory Chancellor refused to raise benefits - which will rise at less than half inflation. Meanwhile his £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will mostly benefit people in work.Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the overnight analysis found.The experts said: “The scale and distribution of the cost of living squeeze, coupled with the lack of support for low-income families, means that a further . million people are set to fall into absolute poverty next year, including , children – the first time Britain has seen such a rise outside of recessions.” With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Despite the tax cuts yesterday, the think tank said only those earning between £, and £, will actually pay less income tax in -. And only those earning between £, and £, will pay less tax and National Insurance . Of the  million people in work, around  millionwill pay more in income tax and NI in -, the think tank said. By  earnings will be £, behind what they would have beenthey had continued growing on the pre- path.  Torsten Bell, Chief Executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “In the face of a cost of living crisis that looks set to make this Parliament the worst on record for household incomes, the Chancellor came to the dispatch box yesterday promising support with the cost of living today, and tax cuts tomorrow. Signicant measures were announced on both counts, but the big picture is that policy does not measure up to the rhetoric. “The decision not to target support at those hardest hit by rising prices will leave low-and-middle income households painfully exposed, with . million people, including half a million children, set to fall below the poverty line this coming year. “And despite the eye-catching p cut to income tax, the reality is that the Chancellor’s tax changes mean that seven-in-eight workers will see their tax bills rise. Those tax rises mean the Chancellor is able to point to a swt fiscal consolidation and signicant headroom against his fiscal rules. “The big picture is that Rishi Sunak has prioritised rebuilding his tax-cutting credentials over supporting the low-to-middle income households who will be hardest hit from the surging cost of living, while also leaving himself fiscal flexibility in the years ahead. Whether that will be sustainable in the face of huge income falls to come remains to be seen.”  Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog chairman Richard Hughes said despite the measures announced by Rishi Sunak, people still face an unprecedented fall in living standards. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: So in total, they amount to about an £ billion giveaway in this spring statement coming from the Chancellor. That offsets around a third of the overall hit to living standards that people would otherwise have felt had he not taken those measures, so without the Chancellor taking action, people would have felt a % fall in their living standards in the coming  months. That reduces it down to around %, but itaposs still an unprecedented fall in peopleaposs standard of living over the next  months. Mr Hughes also said energy bills are doubling over the course of the year, rising by around % in April and another % in October.

He’s asking for us to come out and make a stand - for Ukraine, for freedom and for peace. Today, we are answering that call in London. We are organising a march through the centre of our great capital, followed by a vigil in Trafalgar Square, where thousands of people will come together to show their support for the Ukrainian people. We want to send an emphatic message to Ukrainians- you are not alone and we condemn Putin’s barbaric aggression. We will never stop raising our voices in support of the struggle for freedom, peace and democracy. Horric war crimes are being committed by the Putin regime, and this unprovoked invasion is causing the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War. We have all seen the heart-breaking images of innocent civilians being targeted, apartment blocks burnt out and children clutching their toys as they flee. I’ve been proud of the way people across our country have come forward to help Ukrainians in their hour of need - whether it’s by donating money or offering a home to refugees. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here  We have a moral duty to help and on Saturdayaposs march we will be saying loud and clear that we stand ready to welcome more Ukrainians with open arms. Refugees will always be welcome in London and given the support they need. That’s why I’m announcing that City Hall will be giving an extra £. million to ensure refugees get access to the vital services they require when they arrive.  Taking to the streets will also be crucial to keeping up the pressure on national governments – helping to ensure they continue to take the necessary action. So far, many international leaders, businesses and people around the world have been united in putting measures in place to support the Ukrainian people and to hold Putin’s regime accountable. One month on - as the war continues to rage and as Russian shells continue to rain down on innocent civilians in Ukrainian cities - we cannot allow our collective resolve to wane. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section That’s why it’s more important than ever that we make our voices heard – so that we can ensure our government and governments around the world maintain focus, introduce even tougher sanctions and live up to all the promises made to refugees. We begin our solidarity march from Park Lane at pm.

But he said he had “always tried to be honest with people”, and said: “I can’t protect them from absolutely everything that we face.” Mr Sunak said he was “anxious” on behalf of the country and said he knew rising financial pressures were “the number one concern that people have right now”. Speaking on Beth Rigby Interviews on Sky News, he said: “Families are struggling with the rising cost of lots of things and that’s why in the spring statement I wanted to make sure that we demonstrated we were on people’s side, and we announced the tax plan that will deliver the biggest net cut taxes, net cut to personal taxes in two years, in quarter of a century taken together.” He said: “Where we can make a dference, we will, and I’m confident that the plan yesterday will do that.”  The Chancellor added: “I think what we’ve done is substantial. If you take together £ billion to help people with energy bills announced last month, the signicant tax cuts that we announced yesterday, they will all help. But of course they can’t mitigate all the dficulties that high inflation is causing. No chancellor could do that.”Earlier, Downing Street said ministers stood ready to provide further support to householdsrequired after Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to suggest more measures could be announced.Mr Johnson admitted it was “going to be tough” as households had to cope with rising prices and the cost-of-living squeeze. He said: “It will continue to be tough, continue to be choppy but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout.” Separately, he told LBC “as we go forward, we need to do more” and insisted the Government would “fix” the rising cost of living.Richard Hughes, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said on Thursday that despite the measures announced by Mr Sunak, people still face an “unprecedented” fall in living standards.The Institute for Fiscal Studiessaid the Chancellor had failed to protect the country’s poorest households. But Mr Sunak insisted he had “protected those on the lowest incomes the most” in recent years.  Asked about figures from the Resolution Foundation think tank, which said . million Britons were set to fall below the poverty line next year, including , children, Mr Sunak told Beth Rigby Interviews: “Well, I mean, what we do know is the track record, because there’s lots of projections and speculation about the future, but the track record shows that over the last  years, since we’ve had Conservative governments in charge, the number of people living in poverty has actually declined by about . million people. “That includes , children from memory. So actually, that’s a record that I’m proud of. “Now, obviously, a lot of that happened before I was in post. But the actions I’ve taken over the past couple of years have ensured that we have protected those on the lowest incomes the most.” Told that it felt like the country was being “gaslighted” by his reassurances amid the rising costs and as inflation rose, he said: “I’m not denying for one second that inflation is dficult. Of course it’s dficult, and it’s most dficult for those on lower incomes.” The Chancellor, who has been tipped as a potential successor to the PM, also failed three times to rule out that he could launch a leadership bid in the future. He read a quote from Mr Johnson, who said in  that being prime minister “would be a great, great thing to have a crack at”,“the ball came loose from the back of the scrum”, and askedhe felt the same. Mr Sunak said: “I’m much more a cricket and football fan, so I don’t know what the appropriate analogy is. But as we’ve talked about at the moment, there’s a lot going on, there’s a big job to do and I’m fully focused on doing that job and trying to do it as well as I can.” Asked again, with a cricket analogy,he would be interested, he said: “At this point, I’m just trying to stay at the crease and keep in place and not get out.” Asked a third time, this time with a football comparison, he said: “We’re stretching these analogies too far.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyRichard HughesBoris JohnsonEnergy billsLiving standardsPrice risesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Heartfelt tributes have been paid to Martin Greenfield, who performed as “Honey Lingus”.Martin died at the age of  last week, after a struggle with illness and some mental health issues,Chronicle Live reports .As both Martin and Honey, they were much-loved as a performer and a friend, who will be remembered for their energy, light, joy, empathy. Trailblazing Martin is thought to have been one of the first black drag queens performing in Newcastle when they started their act in the s.  Close friend Mark Stephenson remembered them as a star that always shined bright. Mark has known Martin since they were both , when Martin moved to the North East from Hong Kong. The pair worked at popular club Powerhouse together, and Mark recalled how Honey began to come to le as Martin became a part of Newcastleaposs LGBTQ scene. He said: Martin was always bigger than le, very flamboyant, peopleaposs attention was always drawn to Martinaposs clothes and long nails. Back in , , when they started performing as Honey, she was probably one of Newcastleaposs first black drag queens. Martin was a perfectionist so they always looked unreal, absolutely beautul. Honey would work a room and was able to sing brilliantly, could always hold a note, and was very much a perfectionist in terms of being the most beautul person in the room. They did seasons in Ibiza, performing around the world as Honey and they loved that. Honey was really well-known around the gay scene in Newcastle. With a vibrant energy that couldnapost be ignored, Martin loved music and dance and worked with ious cultural organisations across the North East. Mark remembered fondly their love of music - Martin was once dancing so joyfully at a Diana Ross concert in Newcastle that they were invited up on stage - but also the quieter side of Martin, who loved nature, gardening and cooking. Mark said: Thereaposs Honey and thereaposs Martin and they are two dferent people. Honey is Martinaposs bigger-than-le persona. Martin was a very loving person who would give their all to everybody, they were very into growing things and learning new skills, spicing all the food they cooked up to the hilt. That was a dferent side of Martin. A fierce advocate for LGBTQ rights, Martin refused to let prejudice stop them from being themselves. Mark remembers a more hostile environment in the city in the s when Martin started performing, but on or off stage, they refused to be kept silent. He said: Martin was not scared of anything or being the first person to do anything. I remember when we were , walking round Newcastle, and Martin was quite obviously a gay person and people would shout aposp***apos or aposf*****apos and Iaposd be worried, but Martin would just own it, saying aposMark, these people donapost bother meapos. Martin was always very much at the forefront of fighting for what they believed in. I think Martin was someone who paved the path for people and they were definitely someone who did that by being themself, whether as Martin or when performing as Honey. Iaposm just so proud that I had them in my le, because I think my le would very much not have been the sameit wasnapost for Martin. Loved ones are set to say farewell to Martin in a natural burial ceremony and a celebration of their le and their family is currently raising money to commemorate them as they would have wished. On a GoFundMe page which has already collected more than £,, their brother, Steve Greenfield, said: From events with thousands of people down to intimate and real person-to-person conversations, Martinaposs beauty and warmth radiated to everyone. For my part, being sometime witness to the joy they brought, and knowing people in Martin’s many friendship circles, I can say their energy, light, joy, empathy and, at their best, glorious nature will echo, reverberate, and resonate always. Martin was a stunning, unique soul Honey a fierce and compassionate entertainer. Together their force led to a le, though shortened, that was full to the brim with experiences, events, friends and times of truly living. He added: We were all better for knowing Martin or Honey - or indeed both.

This weekend will mark the two-year anniversary since the start Max Woosey, , camped out in March .Since then he has camped out at London Zoo,  Downing Street and Twickenham Rugby Stadium and won praise from PM Boris Johnson.And from March , he has raised a staggering £, - which is more than £, including Gt Aid - enough to pay the annual salary of twenty hospice nurses. Maxaposs Big Camp Out will be on Saturday night where he will be joined by celebrity backers including Carol Vorderman and fellow Pride of Britain winners including Hughie and Freddie, Stephen Wharton and Harmonie-Rose Allen. The event will begin at an undisclosed site in Braunton, Devon, on Saturday at pm and will feature live music throughout the day. Despite drawing the formal fundraising to a close, his mum Rachael Woosey said Max was not coming indoors anytime soon - as camping outside had become a way for le for him.  She said: After the two years passes this weekend, we will become a lot more passive. There will be no need to do social media and we will wind the fund raising down. Max will then quietly do this thing and it will become less about fund raising and more just a way of le. It has been two years of his le that has been amazing and a real adventure for him. But I think he maybe just needs a bit of normality and not have people caring about where he sleeps all the time. But he is not coming in though and wants to stay sleeping in his tent. He said he will consider sleeping in a hotelwe go away but that is his only concession. Heaposs happy out there and there would be more distractions inside. Now heaposs at secondary school, Iaposd just rather he was getting a good nightaposs sleep. The efforts of the inspirational schoolboy has been described as insane by the North Devon Hospice.  The sleep out began on March   in memory of Maxaposs friend and neighbour, Rick Abbot, who died in February . Rick, who was , had given Max a tent and told him to have an adventure with it, so he decided to camp out in the garden of his family home in Braunton. Rachael said Maxaposs longevity had surprised many family members but they were incredibly proud of his achievements. She added: A lot of family members thought enough was enough after six months and there was a big pull to get him back inside. As far as we are concernedhe is in fresh air and sleeping well then we donapost have a problem with it. We are all incredibly proud of what he has done and we love he has done it all off his own back. He has shown children can make a dference and have a go at something. It would have been very easy not to have let him have a go but what he has done has been remarkable. He will be out for the full two years so the last night will be on Monday night. It will be quite emotional and I will camp out with him again that night to finish it off. But that will be a private time for us - the big public event to close it is on Saturday. What he has achieved for the hospice has made such a dference. But as an inidual he has also grown in confidence and that will set him up for the future. He has an amazing sense of self now and will carry that forward I am sure. The support we have had from everyone has been amazing and I would like to thank everyone for really getting behind Max the way they have. To achieve so much by sleeping in his tent has been remarkable really. Reflecting on the last year, which also saw him pick up a Pride of Britain award, Max said: The whole thing has been a bit of a dream. I have met so many amazing people and done so many amazing things such as going to Twickenham and  Downing Street. The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

High air pollution warnings have been issued for parts of England, such as the Midlands, the South East, and North West. The high alert is in place from London to Ipswich and Cambridge, as well as further north to Nottingham and to Hull. According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs , Leicester, Northampton, and Manchester are also among the places affected, along with spots along the south coast, including Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings. Advice issued by DEFRA suggests adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should “reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors, and particularlythey experience symptoms”. “People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often.  “Older people should also reduce physical exertion,” the group added.Additionally, anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat was advised to consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors. According to Sky News, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan warned that toxic air “is dangerous”, particularly for those with heart and lung problems.He urged residents to look after each other by walking, cycling, avoiding unnecessary car trips and stopping engine idling. He also asked people to withhold from burning wood or garden waste. Earlier this year Mr Khan said car use had ed to close to pre-pandemic levels and that the effect on residents could be disastrous.“If we do not double down on our efforts to deliver a greener, more sustainable future, we will replace one public health crisis with another – caused by filthy air and gridlocked roads,” he said.

The -year-old granddad felt naturally lost and unmotivated about le. However, he admitted he a good support system around him which has enabled him to get through the dficult times. Fred said: Death creates such an entity behind you. Youaposre in a dark place one minute and then you the other way. You take five steps forward, and then  back. People say that time is a healer but I think while it helps, the key is to have a good structure around you. When people say they understand itaposs nice to say but they donapost understand. I donapost go out half as much now I think sometimes I feel like a burden because people think they canapost have a good time because Iaposm there. Le has got to go on though. Itaposs not fair for me to put that on people. Fred luckily has a number of friends in the community. One vital friend is Adele Kendrew who helps run the Edmund House social club in Pontefract Lane.  She told Fred she would help him get back on his feet by keeping him busy day to day. He began cleaning, painting, and helping sorting out the club which gave him a sense of purpose. Fred added: It helped me come out of my shell and gave me a sense of purpose. It took my mind off it. Itaposs like youaposre acting on a stage and then you come off stage and you have to face reality when you go home. It would all come back to me then. But the club did their absolute best and it did help. People might not think it but Iaposm such a reserved person and itaposs hard to talk about a subject that has taken two members of your family. He wanted to help out his community and give back to families struck down by cancer and he began helping out with Leeds independent charity Maggieaposs. Fred added: Maggieaposs has been open short of three years and I went in and I broke down. Theyaposre really good understanding people. I ask themI could help out, and while they told me itaposs not for everybody I am now able to help people feel comforted, and I speak to them about the hard times. The charity decided to conduct a charity bike ride from Leeds to Barcelona - covering , miles. Fred immediately signed up and will be taking part in the challenge on April  - coincidentally the anniversary of his weaposs death. He said: The date of the bike ride is the day of my weaposs death. Iaposve had my bike sprayed and the colours are the same as the Maggieaposs logo. My bike has both my we and daughteraposs name on. I look at le like a crusade now, not just for me, but I am doing this for everybody and for people who canapost do it. Although since having a knee replacement recently, the brave granddad will travel from Leeds, through to Hull, ferry to Rotterdam, Belgium into France and then ride down into Barcelona through Spain. Fred added: I have seen the dference Maggieaposs makes in peopleaposs lives, and I know it is essential that these centres and charities help support those with cancer and their families.

Her mum, Laura Hindle, , watched in disbelief as she was rushed to hospital where she suffered a second stroke, leaving a third of her brain damaged and paralysing the left side of her body. Now eight years old, Victoria still suffers with hemiplegia , causing extreme fatigue and dficulty completing certain tasks.Stay at home mum, Laura told The Mirror : “I still to this day cannot get my head around it, it’s horric. “I had received a call from her school to say that she had taken a bit of a tumble in the playground but she was fine, so I said ‘thanks for letting me know’ and didn’t worry too much. “But then a couple of hours later I got another call to say she was very ill and I needed to come right away because they had called her an ambulance. “When I got there she had completely collapsed, she was just slumped up against one side of the room. She couldn’t talk to me or anything. “When the paramedics got there they asked her to put her hands above her head, but she could only lt her right arm.“Then they asked her to smile and there was a visible drop on one side. “For a split second it crossed my mind ‘she’s had a stroke’. “But then I told myself don’t be ridiculous, children don’t have strokes.” Victoria was rushed to hospital where tests confirmed Laura’s worst fears - she had experienced a stroke, but doctors were unable to determine any trigger or cause. Only the following day, while waiting for a scan with her parents in the hospital, Victoria experienced a second severe stroke, leaving her left side paralysed and damaging  per cent of her brain. Mum of four Laura said: “We were walking down the corridor and she turned around and said ‘my headache is coming back’. “Just as she put her hand to her head, she collapsed. “I had never heard of a child having a stroke, I was in shock, we couldn’t get to grips with what the doctors were talking about until they showed us her scans and we saw the damage. “To actually witness my child’s face visibly dropping on one side was horric, it was like something out of a horror film.” After extensive research, Laura has discovered a machine which would give Victoria the use of her arm again, by stimulating the nerves which send messages to the limb from the brain.Victoria has already benefited from temporary use of the Saebo-stimulator Pro machine in the weeks after her strokes while recovering at The Children’s Trust for children with brain injuries. But now Laura is desperate to give her daughter a “normal le” after admitting that some children have already started teasing Victoria for her injury.Now Laura has set up a GoFundMe to raise £, for the machine and therapy to help Victoria, with any proceeds spent on further rehabilitation which could aid a normal lestyle.She said: “People that don’t know Victoria might just think that she has had an injury because of her walk. “But she experiences extreme fatigue and she has a tendency to fall over a lot. “She’s already had some grief from other kids being unkind saying things like ‘you can’t play with us because you only have one arm’. “It’s dficult because children often don’t understand things they can’t see and a stroke is something you can’t see.“It’s heartbreaking to watch her sometimes because she wants so badly to be able to do something as simple as remove a pen lid without having to ask someone to do it for her, or putting her school tie on. “She’s such a bright and bubbly little girl, she loves dancing and playing just like any other child her age. “I want her to have access to everything anyone can expect from a normal le like being able to do her makeup when she gets older. “I always tell her, you’re no dferent to anybody , you just need a bit more time.”To donate to Victoria’s fundraiser, click here.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON StrokeHospitalsTherapy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The furniture giant today published findings of a probe into surveillance cameras placed above  bathrooms at a distribution centre in Peterborough. Bosses installed cameras in toilet ceiling voids in November  to monitor staff membersapos alleged drug use and provision of  urine samples. But the investigation revealed that two cameras became dislodged and accidentally filmed communal areas in both a female and male bathroom. No footage was captured of toilet cubicles. An IKEA spokesperson said: Whilst the intention at the time was to ensure the health and safety of co-workers, we understand the fact that colleagues were filmed unknowingly in these circumstances will have caused real concern.  ‘For this we are sincerely sorry,” they continued. The cameras were operational until July  and were not recording when staff found them last September, the investigation said. It added that no CCTV was recorded in toilet cubicles and that footage showing staff in bathrooms was only seen during the independent investigation. An IKEA spokesperson added: Their [the camerasapos] installation followed serious concerns about the use of drugs onsite, which, owing to the nature of work carried out at the site, could have very serious consequences for the safety of our co-workers. The cameras placed within the voids were positioned only to record irregular activity in the ceiling voids. They were not intended to, and did not, record footage in the toilet cubicles themselves. “However, as a result of ceiling tiles becoming dislodged, two cameras inadvertently recorded footage of the communal areas of two bathrooms for a period of time in . The footage was not viewed at the time and was only recovered as part of these investigations. IKEA said it had passed the reportaposs findings onto the Information Commissioneraposs Office, the UK regulator for data privacy.

TV footage showed him scoffing down a pepperoni pizza and chatting with several military personnel. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here But Biden complained he was blocked from crossing the border to Ukraine.In an emotional speech, he also mentioned his grandfather and his late son Beau Biden who was an Iraq War veteran. Like you, he didnapost have to go either... the point is there are hundreds of thousands of people like my son, like all of you, so thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, he said. We have a sacred obligation in this government... to equip those we send to war and to care for them and their families when they come home, he said.  It comes as Biden was due to be briefed on the humanitarian response to help civilians sheltering from Russian attacks inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees fleeing Ukraine. Biden told reporters in Brussels yesterday that his visit to Poland will reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine. The US President is due to travel to Warsaw to have talks with Polandaposs President Andrzej Duda. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan appeared to the United States and its allies could still impose new measures to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.During an emergency NATO summit in Brussels yesterday, leaders agreed to step up measures to protect Ukraine and members of the -country alliance from a Russian chemical or nuclear attack. Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels: Today we agreed to do more including cyber-security assistance and equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats. This could include detection equipment, protection and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management. Mr Stoltenberg said Natoaposs chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements had been activated and we are taking measures both to support Ukraine and to defend ourselves. Asked whether the move was based on credible intelligence, Mr Stoltenberg said: We are concerned, partly because we see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext - accusing Ukraine, the United States, Nato allies - for preparing to use chemical and biological weapons. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged NATO chiefs to send tanks and warplanes to his war-torn country so forces can repel Russian invaders.In a passionate video link plea to an emergency summit at the coalition’s headquarters, he warned leaders from the organisation’s  member countries that delays to vital equipment were costing lives. He fumed: “You have thousands of fighter jets but we havenapost been given any yet. “We asked for tanks so that we can unblock our cities that are now dying - Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol, others - cities where Russia is keeping hundreds of thousands of people hostage and articially creating famine no water, no food, nothing there. “You have at least , tanks Ukraine asked for a per cent - one per cent of all your tanks to be given or sold to us - but we do not have a clear answer yet. “The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NatoU.S. ArmyJens StoltenbergJoe BidenNATO summitSoldiersPizzaOn Instagram\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Rachel Wilson, from St Helens, had to stop driving and leave her job - but still had no idea what was wrong with her. Medical officials repeatedly told her that her symptoms were just anxiety - leaving Rachel fearing that she was going aposcrazyapos. Eventually, she issued a desperate plea on Facebook, asking friends and family for help identying her symptoms. Incredibly, a chance conversation with a friend who saw her post led the mum to discover she had epilepsy. Speaking to the Mirror, she recalled the first time she suffered a seizure - while driving with her son Sonny. She said: It was completely out of the blue, I was driving to Manchester with my little boy in the car.Luckily, we were in traffic lights, and I just had this with a weird sensation.Almost like I was going to faint and I opened the windows. It was really strange.On the way home, I had another one and we were on the motorway and I was completely paralysed, I couldnapost even indicate for the junction we needed to get off at. I was having them every time, while I was working. I couldnapost put my finger on it. After visiting the doctors, she was diagnosed with sinusitis and underwent surgery which made no dference and then sent for allergy testing. But when the pandemic struck - she struggled to access help, and her mental health noseed. She said: I was misdiagnosed for a long time, and due to the prolonged misdiagnosis, I was made to feel like it was psychological. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereAt times, I felt like I was going crazy. In the beginning, my symptoms werenapost taken seriously. I wasn’t sent for any tests and so the diagnosis was delayed.I was given other diagnoses that were minor in comparison to epilepsy, ones which required a lot less investigation. My seizures were put down to sinus problems, an allergy and then anxiety.I was placed on a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications and told that once the depression eased, then the aposanxiety attacksapos which were actually seizures would also settle down.The GP never referred me to anyone . During the pandemic, she struggled further as she was never offered a video or virtual appointment.Rachel said: For a long time, the seizures were described as aposa classic case of anxiety attacksapos due to a mental and nervous breakdown…that I had suffered  years after starting with the seizures.It was only when I spoke to a dferent GP that she was concerned and sent me to AE. This was after four and a half years of seizures.I was diagnosed in December  with epilepsy and frontal lobe cavernoma. I was absolutely devastated I couldnapost see any future with such a lelong diagnosis.I felt angry that this had happened to me, I felt desperately sad. I felt guilty, that I had failed my family, that I wasnapost the woman that my husband had married and that neither of us had signed up to this.I was worried that le would never be the same and that my son deserved more than me as his Mama. I was angry that this could have been diagnosed a long time ago and that by now I would have accepted and come to terms with it. I worried about finances, too. I had recently lost my job due to ill health and then I knew I’d have to surrender my driving licence. I knew it would really dficult for my husband to stay in the same job role.I worried about having to rely on other people to do things for me, things that I once seemingly took for granted. I had heard of epilepsy, but it turns out I knew very little. I had a preconception that all seizures were physical and that it was always caused by flashing lights.When I was diagnosed, I realised that flashing lights affect a minority and that the term ‘invisible disabilities’ now applies to me. I have absence seizures. I get an aura of a rising in my stomach, almost like Iaposm on a fairground ride. It’s a rising burning sensation from my stomach to my chest.I usually have time to say aposIaposm having a feelingapos until I go into the seizure. I have always called them aposfeelingsapos because for over  years I didnapost know what they were and how to describe them to my young son.It was important for him to be aware that they were happening, and calling them feelings didnapost sound as scary for him. Once the aura is over, I quickly go into a zoned-out state.I am completely paralysed and unable to move any part of my body, including blinking. I have been told I have a certain vacant look. I stare into space and Iaposm not able to communicate. Everything around me is intensied, noises sound unbearably loud, voices sound distorted, I become really cold with goosebumps. This lasts for approximately  minutes, and then I become really hot, sweating and Iaposm wiped out and exhausted. The more I have the more tired I am.I can fall asleep suddenly and usually by the time it passes I then have another one quickly after. We have all been shocked. I have felt supported. I have found that with a diagnosis, people have been a lot more accepting of what have turned out to be seizures.No-one knows what another person is going through, but people have a lot of love and support to give. Since diagnosis, it feels amazing to have people listen, believe and understand what I have been feeling for so long.The worries and lack of understanding on my part impacted my mental health. I am currently under a neurologist and a neurosurgeon for the cavernoma.Now she hasnapost had a seizure since th January, after starting medication, and says she is starting to remember the person I was before this started and I see light at the end of tunnel.” As many as , people in the UK are facing an epilepsy diagnosis this year, but Epilepsy Action warns many are struggling to get the information they need. Tom Beddow, advice and information services manager at Epilepsy Action, said: “The impact of epilepsy is huge, and goes way beyond initial diagnosis.Even before the pandemic hit, neurology services were one of the least funded, most stretched areas of the NHS.“Now, two years on, we have a surge in people seeking our help, fresh from being diagnosed over the phone, sometimes in as little as  minutes.Many are being left to their own devices, struggling to find support, not knowing their rights or their rrisks.To coincide with Purple Day on  March, the global awareness day for epilepsy, Epilepsy Action has released a video sharing the overwhelming panic and confusion that can follow an epilepsy diagnosis.

The now-infamous bit of road has left many people red-faced and a few quid down while travelling from England to North Wales on holiday. The stretch on the A between Abergwyngregyn and Talybont, Gwynedd, in Wales, has left one driver so incensed he urged people not to drive down it unless theyaposre aware of the speed restrictions.One motorist Anthony Martindale penned a letter in frustration to the Liverpool Echo, the Daily Post reports.Mr Martindale was caught speeding in both directions between junctions  and , even though all lanes were open and no construction work was being carried out - earning himself a £ fine, three points on his licence and ordered to take a drivers awareness course costing £.  He said: The construction workers had made sure everything was safe when they stopped work on the Friday evening, so health and safety was not an issue.“All four lanes were open so there was no disruption to traffic. Yet the North Wales Police still saw fit to continue letting the traffic continue at mph when it was safe to resume the statutory speed of mph.“On the westbound, I was caught doing mph and on the eastbound I was doing mph. It seems I was not alone thinking that it was actually safer to travel faster on that stretch of road because on that particular Sunday,  people were caught, myself included.” Temporary speeding restrictions are in place along the road as part of a £m scheme to improve safety along part of the .km stretch of carriageway.  Access roads are being removed and eight gaps in the central reservation are being plugged, while a new parallel road, with underpass, is being built for farm vehicles. Mr Martindaleaposs expensive trip prompted a Freedom of Information request to police which showed over six weekend - from January  to February  - a total of  speeding fines were handed out between junctions  and . On January , the worst day for speeding drivers,  were dished out, with numbers tailing off after that. On the weekend from February  to February , no fines were handed out - but only as all temporary signs were removed after a severe weather warning.Worst day for fines was on January  when  fines were awarded. Thereafter, motorists became wiser to the restrictions and the number of fines tailed off. On the weekend of February -, no fines were dished out – but only because all temporary signs were removed after a severe weather warning. Mr Martindale wants to warn holidaymakers to be aware of suffering the same consequences he did. He said: “If any readers are planning to go to North Wales over the summer months, they need to be made aware that at the roadworks on the A at junction  and , anyone going faster than mph will be photographed and fined.” On this stretch of the road, a Temporary Traffic Order restricts speeds to mph through the works. A mph speed limit is also in place on the approaches to the works. These restrictions are operational  hours-a-day. A Welsh Government spokesman said: “Narrow lanes and a mph speed restriction were implemented on the eastbound carriageway during March  and on the westbound carriageway during October . These restrictions were introduced to protect both the travelling public and the workforce.

Ross Molloy runs RGM Brailsford Garage, the oldest petrol station in Derbyshire where the fuel has been flowing since .Rocketing fuel prices have made business very dficult for independent, local fuel stations, Leeds Live reported. He acknowledged that although some facilities may be marking up their prices to increase their profits, for the majority the hike is needed to simply break even. Ross said: People blame the retailer, like me. They are saying you are putting up the price, you are cashing in. Iaposve been making about p a litre profit on diesel and Esso down the road are selling it cheaper than I can buy it for.  I usually sell for around p more than Esso. I have to put it up because it comes to me at a high price. Iaposve almost been giving it away to be honest, and thataposs why there arenapost many small garages left. Ross says higher prices are being driven by his diesel supplier preferring him to buy larger quantities of fuels, a practice he says benefits big buyers. I canapost buy large amounts because modern fuels donapost keep. Diesel keeps for two or three months and then it is starting to go off in a tank, he said. The amount I sell,I bought , litres, which is what they want me to buy, it would be in the tanks for months before I sold it. I canapost buy a large amount because it wonapost keep, so I have to buy a smaller amount which is more expensive and I am hardly selling any of it.Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a p fuel duty cut on Wednesday.Although this is the biggest ever cut to fuel duty, motoring groups like RAC believe this wonapost make a big dference to motorists given the rocketing rise in fuel prices.Ross said: Anything is better than nothing, but the amount of tax we pay on fuel, to be honest itaposs just going to be a drop in the ocean. Yes it cancels the rise in price, but not by a lot. For the likes of me,the Chancellor knocks p off, it isnapost going to make much of a dference. Unfortunately, over the Christmas period a vehicle drove into the diesel pumps at the garage and they are yet to be repaired. But even before the accident, Ross was unable to afford his own diesel. Now, with the prices soaring further, Ross is unsure whether it is worth fixing the pumps.  He said: At the moment I am weighing up whether it is even worth getting them repaired for the amount I make out of it. It upsets me because this is the oldest petrol station in Derbyshire -  is when this place started selling fuel and although I donapost make anything out of the fuel, I donapost want to be the last person to sell fuel at the oldest petrol station in Derbyshire. Earlier this week a petrol station in Cha, west London was spotted selling petrol for £. a litre - around p more than the national average. After Sunakaposs announcement Asda, Tesco, Sainsburyaposs and Morrisons announced that they would be lowering the cost of their petrol. UK motorists are now being forced to pay an average of £. a litre for unleaded and £. a litre for diesel. On Wednesday RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes warned that the Chancelloraposs decision to cut fuel duty would only help consumersretailers passed on the savings. There’s also a very real risk retailers could just absorb some or all of the duty cut themselves by not lowering their prices, he said. If this proves to be the case it will be dire for drivers. It also wouldn’t be totally unexpected based on the biggest retailers not reducing their prices late last year when the oil price fell sharply. Changes in prices at the pump are linked to the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate.

As a former Olympian herself, the Queen aposs daughter was part of the team who worked tirelessly to bring the prestigious sporting event to the UK. The Princess Royal worked incredibly hard in securing the bid, and was said to be absolutely integral in ensuring the UK was successful - and it certainly wasnapost plain sailing.In fact, Anne did make one very serious error in the build up to the games, which couldaposve completely overshadowed all the hard work sheaposd already put in.  The princess, who became the first member of the royal family to compete in the Olympics in , was caught making a rude comment about one of her fellow committee members when she forgot to turn off her microphone.Sebastian Coe shared the story, which he admits is one of his favourites, during an ITV documentary, Anne: The Princess Royal at , which was released in .Speaking about her contribution to the Olympics, he said: It was always to the point, she doesnapost always suffer fools gladly, she doesnapost speak for the sake of speaking. I do remember, after a rather long-winded interjection by one of the committee members, she had actually forgotten to turn her microphone off. She managed to mutter the immortal words: aposI think this person is probably the most stupid person in world sportapos.

However, despite the embarrassing blunder Anne managed to stay completely calm and styled it out in the most professional manner. Mr Coe continues: This echoed around the room and she never flinched.

Itaposs probably one of my favourite moments.Prime Minister Boris Johnson also spoke about Anneaposs contributions in the documentary, claiming she was absolutely integral to our winning the bid.Then, she did a huge job with the Olympic Association, he added.

The Duke of Sussex and we Meghan Markle have decided not to fly back to the UK for the event on Tuesday, despite other members of The Firm and royals from around the world due to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburghaposs decades of duty. Harry was originally planning to attend however pulled out after rows about his security in the UK, which has seen him take on the Home Office in yet another legal battle. Ingrid Seward, author of Prince Philip Revealed, A man of his Century, believes the Queen, who is determined to attend despite recent mobility issues, knows her late husband would expect her to make every effort to be there.Speaking to The Mirror, she said: Even someone as unassuming as the Queen might have expected some better luck during the culmination of her -year reign.  Instead, she has had nothing but trouble. Her once strong physique is decidedly frail after hurting her back in October . This year she has had to cancel all her public appearances including the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey because in her own words, “I can’t move!”.She is determined to be at her late husband’s memorial on Tuesday however hard it is for her to get there. She knows he would expect it as much as she knows he would be angry and disappointed Prince Harry has chosen not to go.The memorial service will honour the Duke of Edinburghaposs dedication to “family, nation and Commonwealth”, his contribution to public le and his steadfast support to his charities, Buckingham Palace has said. Members of the royal family, more than  foreign royals, the duke’s wider family and friends, and  representatives from his patronages and charities will gather in Westminster Abbey on Tuesday. The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, the youth scheme set up by Philip in , will feature prominently, with a special tribute delivered by a Gold Award holder.Ingrid also believes the negative headlines around her grandson would have been dficult for the Queen to handle, especially with everything going on. Yesterday there was another hearing in his latest legal battle, this time against the Home Office over his police protection in the UK. A High Court judge ruled that parts of documents in the case will remain secret. Ingrid writes: Negative headlines about her grandson Prince Harry and accusations against her favourite son Prince Andrew have made unhappy reading for Her Majesty. Prince Harry’s legal disputes have been continuous and his wrangle with the British government over his royal protection when he is in the UK is ongoing. The Queen would be forgiven for feeling her family are jinxed. Even the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have run into dficulties on their Platinum Jubilee tour of the Caribbean. What should have been all smiles and flag waving has turned into protests about slavery exacerbated by the impending th anniversary of Jamaica’s independence, the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.In his address at the Governor General’s banquet William choose his words carefully echoing the same sentiments as his father had done in Barbados as he talked about the ‘appalling atrocity’ of the slave trade. The couple were well briefed to expect some controversy so were not surprised when the prime minister expresses his sentiments about Jamaica – a country which has always loved the Queen - becoming a republic. It might have been kinderhe had waited until after her Platinum Jubilee celebrations to make his point, but of course she understood. It has been a grim few months. Even Prince Charles, now head of the family, has invited scandal by allowing his former aide Michael Fawcett, once chief executive of the Princes Foundation to allow wealthy doners to expect honours for substantial cash donations. I feel these family setbacks will make the Queen more determined than ever to attend Prince Philip’s memorial next Tuesday. She needs to be seen andshe is in a wheelchair – it doesn’t matter. Once again, she will be leading by example and showing the nation that it is OK not to be OK. Confirming details of the service in a statement on Thursday, Buckingham Palace said: Members of the Royal Family will attend a Service of Thanksgiving for the le of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday, th March. The Service will give thanks for The Duke of Edinburgh’s dedication to family, Nation and Commonwealth and recognise the importance of his legacy in creating opportunities for young people, promoting environmental stewardship and conservation, and supporting the Armed Forces. The Service will in particular pay tribute to The Duke of Edinburgh’s contribution to public le and steadfast support for the over  charitable organisations with which His Royal Highness was associated throughout his le.

The UK has basked in weather warmer than Spanish hotspots Marbella and Lanzarote on Thursday as the mercury hold strong again today.Met Office forecasters say much of the weekend will see a continuation of the dry, settled weather that many have seen over in recent days.However, by Tuesday things will become unsettled as a cold air mass will push itself North across the UK. Over the weekend, long spells of sunshine can be expected in the South. Other regions will see a continuation of the dry, settled weather that many have seen over in recent days.  Over Saturday, most can expect light winds and sunshine, with only a risk of an isolated shower in the far north of Scotland. In South West England and Wales, clear skies and temperatures of around C are forecasted. Sunday follows a similar theme and by Monday temperatures will start to drop slightly but will remain dry and fine for most. By Tuesday, more unsettled and cooler weather picture from the middle of next week.  Met Office Chief Meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: “Although the UK has had a good deal of fine and settled March weather in recent days, a change is on the way from the middle of next week with colder air spreading down from the north and the increasing likelihood of rain for most areas. On the hills in the north, there’s a chance of this falling as snow, although we’ll gain more certainty on that in the coming days.  “With the influence of some unsettled weather, we’ll be seeing a marked drop in temperatures for most with colder air arriving from the north. This will see maximum temperatures drop into single figures for many areas, and below freezing overnight.” Ahead of next week, the mini-heatwave is set to continue over the weekend. Temperatures are well above the average on Friday afternoon, with the mercury hitting C in London and Birmingham. Looking ahead to the next few days, Met Office meteorologist Alex Deakin said: It may well be the shortest weekend of the year, because the clocks go forward, but it will be one of the sunniest. Itaposs going to be blue skies almost across the board on both Saturday and Sunday thanks to a chunky area of high pressure thataposs just wobbling around across the UK.

Teacher Lauren Whitworth, , who is a special sergeant with GMP, saw -year-old Kennie Carter, who had suffered a fatal stab wound to the chest, unconscious just yards from his home in Stretford. Kennie had allegedly been followed and pounced on by a group wearing hoods and Covid masks on Stretfordaposs Lakes estate at pm on Saturday, January .He was stabbed in the chest and died later in hospital. Police believe the fatal stabbing was the culmination of a series of tit-for-tat incidents between two rival groups, the Manchester Evening News reports. So far police have arrested  youths on suspicion of murder, aged between  and . Ten of the young suspects remain on police bail.  In the wake of the devastating incident, Special Sergeant Whitworth, from Urmston, the head of maths at Altrincham College, is asking: Have we failed these teenagers  Lauren, who was first police officer on the scene of the stabbing on Thirlmere Avenue in Stretford, alongside PC Charlie Crouch, said the teenageraposs eyes were open but he aposwasnapost thereapos. She is now insisting more work has to be done in schools to tackle kne and crime. Kennie is one of four youths from Greater Manchester who have died because of kne crime in . Lauren said: There was chaos, people everywhere we turned on Thirlmere. At that point Kennie was just laying on the floor. There was somebody giving him CPR, a member of the public.  He was laying down on his back near to the wall on the pavement. He was unconscious and not breathing. I went around the back of the car to collect the first aid bag. My colleague was there administering first aid. Charlie took over. I was with Kennieaposs mum and dad. They only live around the corner. The whole neighbourhood was out. Once we have arrived it feels like a long time before the ambulance arrived, but it was only a matter of one or two minutes. By that point the whole street was flooded with police and paramedics. It was all happening incredibly fast. I tried to put up thescene tape while Kennie was taken to the back of the ambulance where they continued to work on him. A volunteer cop for the last three years, Lauren said: I felt absolutely helpless. Every day I think back and think, could we have done more  I think I question myself as I work in education. Thataposs what upset me most in the coming days and weeks. Have we failed these teenagers  These teenagers are ending up in this situation of being stabbed and people are carrying knives. We need to get to the root cause when they are in school and help them see they have options and opportunities, that carrying a kne isnapost the right option. Itaposs only going to end one way. She described seeing Kennieaposs parents at the scene: They were distraught. It was extremely traumatic and devastating, seeing Kennieaposs mum especially. She was devastated. She was losing her son in front of her eyes, at , when he should be out playing football and getting ready to do his GCSEs. He should be planning for the future. His le was taken away from him. Lauren described how Kennieaposs mother was aposshouting trying to find who had done itapos. She said: There were at least  to  people out. The whole neighbourhood was out. There were children and parents. The whole neighbourhood was out there. I just hope that the conversation around kne crime stays on the table and as parents and teachers or anybody who works with teenagers, we continue to do everything we possibly can to minimize this happening in the future. By the time the police get involved, itaposs already happened. There are branches in the police like safeguarding teams that do work intensively with those involved in kne crime or any sort of criminality. “But really itaposs those that are close to the teenagers at a young age, the teachers that are working with them every day. “Itaposs them that can build this trust.

Four months on and the politan Thames Valley Housingproperty has not been repaired, leaving her fearful that the ceiling could collapse on top of hershe s. The -year-old says the large hole has caused her kitchen to smell of damp.MTVH claim that they fixed the leak before Christmas, Fatima says she had to replace and empty buckets for at least two months because water was continuing to drip through her ceiling. Even though Fatima is currently not living in her one-bed flat, she still has to pay MTVH £ a month in rent, as well as council tax and bills. She claims that MTVH told her it will not reimburse her rent in full because she decided to leave the property a few days after her ceiling collapsed. Fatima said:insists I should have stayed there and should not have left the flat. Even though the kitchen is damaged and I canapost use it to cook. It is as thought they think I decided to mess up my le for three months just for fun. Iaposm very angry about that, the ceiling just dropped.

She said on Reddit: I told her absolutely not. She said she won’t be coming unless the dog can come too.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  Originally wanting her sister to be a bridesmaid, the woman, who is due to marry in six monthsapos time, is now struggling to maintain her guest list as her sister is trying to turn their family against her following the ban. I told her she was being ridiculous. The dog isn’t even trained and there is nothing medically wrong with her, she added.She says it’s for PTSD from our childhood. We had an exceptionally normal childhood with great parents. We never financially struggled or anything like that and were never abused.She is now refusing to come to the wedding and trying to get family members to take her side. She is saying I am discriminating against her disability - PTSD and anxiety caused from a super normal childhood. Claiming her sisteraposs service dog is fake, the bride-to-be explained how her sister adopted the dog as a puppy and started referring to it as a service dog in training so her landlord would allow her to keep him. She added: Now she has herself convinced that she actually needs this dog and that he is performing some kind of therapy for her.  The problem is the dog is not a trained service dog. It barks, it will rub up against you and get slobber and hair on you. Itaposll scratch up your legsit’s excited. I think the whole service dog thing is her way of feeling special, standing out and getting attention from others.She loves the attention the dog brings and it’s super obvious. The dog has its own Instagram for goodness sake.I’m also worried that she will use the dog to steal the attention on my wedding day. She has done this at family birthday parties with the dog and other events. She literally needs people to pay attention to her and her dog. Questioning whether she has been too harsh on her sister or whether her reasoning is justied, the woman has turned to Reddit to seek othersapos opinions.One user said: People like you sister are incredibly annoying for people like me who have actual trained service dogs, and give service dogs a bad rap. My dog helps me with my autism and mental illnesses. I have a hard time navigating crowds and so he is trained to lead me around when I get overwhelmed, along with doing some other stuff. It is incredibly annoying when people think I might be faking him being a service dog because of people like your sister. While some users supported the bride-to-beaposs decision to ban the dog from attending her wedding, others pointed out how her dismissible behaviour towards her sisteraposs mental health might be the reason for her problems. Pretending to speak through the bride, one user said: Dear family, Iaposve just learned that I am the source of sisteraposs PTSD and childhood trauma. I am shocked and sad as I thought we had a wonderful childhood. I cannot in good conscience force sister to attend my wedding. She was gracious enough to try to put her trauma aside, but it is exacerbating her need for her service animal. Please help me support her by supporting her non attendance and not talking about wedding details in front of her. Love you all so much! Another user added: She sounds extremely dismissive of her sister and I really wondersheaposs ever considered that this behaviour could be a cause of her childhood trauma too, especiallyshe has always regarded her sister this way. A fourth user said: Please remember that not all PTSD suffers are affected in the same way. Your symptoms may not affect you to such an extent that they constitute a disability but for others their panic attacks can be completely deliberating.

So far, the impacts on you have probably been minimal. We need emergency action to reduce emissions immediately. Weaposre taking actions into our own hands because our governments and politicians will not. Evenyou donapost care about the impacts on people far away from you, thereaposs also consequences for your neighbours. SUVs cause more air pollution than smaller cars. SUVs are more likely to kill people than normal cars in collisions.Psychological studies show SUV drivers are more likely to take risks on the road. SUVs are unnecessary, and pure vanity. Thataposs why we have taken this action. You will have no dficulty getting around without your gas guzzler, with walking, cycling or public transport. Tyre Extinguishers defended their actions and bragged that they had disarmed around  SUVs in the UK in the past few weeksapos alone. Speaking after finding the letter, Carly said: Iaposm totally up for saving the planet, I do quite a lot in terms of recycling and getting the tram when I donapost actually need my car. It worries me that I canapost hide it or do anything about it. If it happened another time, it could have been really detrimental to my work.  I hope they donapost do it again. I was worried thatthere was an emergency orit happens to the wrong person, someone disabled, someone going into labour or someone with severe mental health problems, that could really push someone over the edge. They canapost be going around doing that, there are ways to go about things. Iaposm paranoid, all I can do is park on the street because on-street parking is all we have. Thereaposs no way of hiding it or anything so it could happen again. A Skoda Yeti is not even dead flash. They said on the note, aposYouaposve got a x in an urban area purely for vanity, you donapost need itapos. You donapost know what people do for a living, thereaposs no way I would have a big carI didnapost need it andit was for vanity I wouldnapost get a Skoda Yeti, Iaposd get a Range Rover or something.Carly shared a photo of the note and her deflated tyre on her local Facebook group where people shared their anger on her behalf.In the end, she was forced to get a taxi to work, but luckily her dad was able to fix the tyre - which only cost her £. She continued: I came outside ready to leave for work and there was a note on my windscreen and a deflated tyre so I was like what the hell, read it and I was like, aposOkapos so I thought, aposWhat do I do apos. I didnapost have time to get the tram. If I donapost have stuff with me, Iaposll get the tram no problem. We have massive costumes which is why I have a x. It was that or a van. I couldnapost get a lt so I got an Uber and then my dad came out in his van to inflate my tyre sotheir aim is to save the planet, they didnapost solve any problems there because then it involved two vehicles instead of one It was a bit crazy. I was pretty annoyed but Iaposm a aposlet go of what you canapost control and problem solveapos kind of person. I just needed to get to class and I would sort it later. A spokesperson for the Tyre Extinguishers said: We are in a climate emergency. If the drivers of SUVs and xs were a country, it would be the seventh-largest polluting country in the world. As we mention on our website, SUVs are dangerous on roads, they are a climate disaster, and they cause massive air pollution. We are citizens taking action because the government refuses to take action on polluting vehicles. The Tyre Extinguishers is a leaderless movement and every week new people join us. We estimate we have disarmed around  SUVs in the UK in just a few weeks and we have had requests for our leaflet to be translated into French, German, Italian and Spanish. We expect to see this spread and we wonapost stop until itaposs impossible to own a huge, polluting gas-guzzler in the worldaposs urban areas. We want to see bans on SUVs in urban areas, pollution levies to tax SUVs out of existence, and massive investment in free, comprehensive public transport. But until politicians make this a reality, Tyre Extinguishers action will continue.Do you have a story to sell  We want to hear all about it.

On the other side of the coin, many modern daters argue that equal rights means itaposs only fair for couples to split the bill, and that it shouldnapost be dictated by gender. One man recently found himself at the centre of such a debate, after a very enjoyable date ended in disaster, when the woman told him she didnapost want to see him again.  At the end of their date, which they had both said they thoroughly enjoyed, the waiter came to their table and askedthey wanted to split the bill, to which he replied: Yes.When I got home, she texted me that she had a good time but she no longer wanted to see me because I am not a gentleman and did not pay for her, he wrote on Reddit.The man explained to his date thathe paid for all his first dates he would be left skint, leaving him questioning what the point would be in spending money on a person who he may not end up dating again.

He wrote: Online dating is trial and error, why would I start spending money on you when I may never even see you again  Unsurprisingly, his post sparked quite a debate, some many traditionalists commenting to defend the woman and her right to want a man who pays. Thataposs her right to want a more traditional dating style. Find someone that better fits your financial situation and keep it pushing, person commented. Another added: Youaposre both allowed to have boundaries and she’s allowed to not want to date or see you again. You guys just weren’t compatible. Move on. Meanwhile, another completely disagreed: Itaposs , I think itaposs high time we put these outdated and sexist gender roles behind us. You cannot expect someone to pay for your meal when you are independent and financially secure, it has nothing to do with being a aposgentlemanapos. Times have changed dramatically now.

The woman, from the US, explained her friend invited her and her husband to South Padre Island in Texas and told her specically to bring one of her black dresses for aspecial eventthat would be taking place during the trip.When the woman was packing, she realised she didnapost fit into the black dress anymore so packed a white one instead, thinking the substitute would be close enough to the one her friend suggested. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. But when the day of the event arrived, her friend told her it was actually her wedding day - and was furious that sheaposd decided to wear white.In her post, the woman said: My best friend invited my husband and me to go on vacation with them at South Padre Island. She told me to bring the dress I wore to my last anniversary dinner for the special dinner event she planned during the vacation. I said sure.I also recently gave birth, and that dress is elegant black lace over a nude dress that is very classy but also form-fitting. When I tried it on when packing, I realised it wasn’t as flattering and my boobs had a hard time fitting. So instead, I packed a cute semi-formal white lace dress instead. I figured it was close enough.  I arrived at the event and found out it was a surprise wedding on the beach where she only invited like  guests. She hadn’t told me it was her wedding because of an inside joke, where I kept telling her and her partner to get married and said theyaposd just elope and next thing we know they are married. The woman said she was horried when she realised the mistake she had made, and things went from bad to worse when she was then told she was supposed to act as the maid of honour at the ceremony. She tried to tell her friend to get someone  to fill the role but she refused - and instead accused her of ruining the wedding. The woman added: She was horried, and so was I. I didn’t bring any other dress, plus there was no time to change buy a new dress. Also, surprise! I’m the maid of honour. I offered to either not be the maid of honour, or leave the wedding, but she rathered me not. Later she blamed me for ruining her wedding because I didn’t follow her instructions to wear a specic dress and didn’t tell her about changing my mind. I said I’m sorry her wedding was ruined but it wasn’t my fault and she should have told me it was her wedding, and at the time of packing, I didn’t find it appropriate to get her approval on my outfit. Commenters on the Reddit post admitted they were initially planning to tell the poster she was in the wrong, but after discovering that she didnapost even know thereaposd be a wedding. One person said: You didnapost know. It was close to the same style, I donapost see how you could have known not to wear white simply because someone asked you to wear a dress they liked on you before.

Some owners are left with no other option but to pay a professional dog walker to exercise their pet whin theyaposre busy - and as long as theyaposve done their research, this shouldnapost be a problem.But one dog owner got more than she bargained for when a client set out a ridiculous demand she must adhere to when walking her energetic dog. Venting to Reddit, the dog walker said: I was pet sitting and dog walking on my own for seven years - needless to say, I have had a lot of experience with dog owners. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  The current client booked me for a one hour walk for once last night and twice today. I walked the dog last night for a little over an hour and got in . miles which was shown on the dogaposs GPS tracker. Several hours later, I received a message saying that the dog needs to be walked  to . miles in an hour. Surprised by this sudden request, the woman searched through their agreement and was unable to find a distance requirement for the job. I am a short person so I have short legs and I am not in shape enough to go that fast, even with incorporating intermittent jogs into the walk, she said. I searched all over the dogaposs profile and this is never mentioned - it just says he needs to be walked for an hour. It is physically impossible for me to get  miles in an hour. Today, I walked the dog again and managed to get  miles in an hour and a half. However, I am only getting paid for an hour, so essentially the owner just got a free  minutes from me.  After dropping the dog off at home, the woman received a condescending message from the owner who claimed her services were not up to scratch. She claims the owner treated her like a child, despite knowing she has almost a decadeaposs worth experience with working with dogs. She added: Several of the messages I have felt have had attitude to them as well. I suggested to the owner that I was going to take the dog on a walk on a nearby trail so we would be away from cars and I felt more comfortable with that and I was completely shot down. Clearly this is not a good of a fit for me and I will be mentioning that after the final walk. I just did not want to leave them to find a new dog walker at the very last minute. The dog is incredibly sweet and I really like him, but the demands and requirements from the owner are just unreasonable for me.Do you think this is a fair demand  Have your say in the comment section below.Unsure how she should handle this situation, the woman has turned to Reddit to ask whether she is overreacting or whether the owneraposs expectations are over the top. One user said: You’re given a time requirement hour, not a distance requirement. This is absurd and that’s awful they are treating you so horribly. I would cut ties with them. It’s not worth it. Another added: This person should be hiring a triathlete to walk their dog -  miles in one hour is a brisk pace for a fit person and  miles is jogging. I have never had a client comment on the distance I walked with their pet. This owner is going to continue to be nothing but trouble. Cut your ties carefully, they may be vengeful and leave a bad review on you. I would use the words, aposnot a good fit based on their needsapos. While a third said: I’m a former cross country runner, and still in good shape. When I’m speed walking, I can approach the  minute a mile mark, but never have reached it.

A unique home with magnicent history has come on the market in the quaint village of Chilcompton, Somerset for £, - but the propertyaposs back garden is an eerie graveyard. The church - which was renovated in the mid s by architect Warwick Rodwell - has been transformed into a light and airy home. Downside Old Church has truly been given a modern make-over and awaits a new family to move in and call it theirs. Originally built in , the property still boasts some of its period features - such as the original church doors and stained glass windows throughout and all the wooden structures.Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Andthose features werenapost original enough for you, it even still has all the gravestones from the church situated in the garden. With some of the headstones being over  years old, it is safe to say these gravestones are no longer visited, but they still very much have their place. There are a number of these historic gravestones in which,wanted, visitors would have to submit a written request to the owner of the property to visit them.  The converted church is currently on the market with estate agency Cooper and Tanner. Branch manager Samuel Masters says: The main draw to the house is the how big it really is inside, the garden is a compromise to some, but the other features make it a great home. The strong colours inside and the way it has been well decorated eradicates any cold and spooky feelings of a church and gives a warm and cosy feeling to the home.  The garden wouldnapost suit everyone, but the house itself has a lot of quirky characteristics. So many memories will have happened in this church, weddings, baptisms and also funerals, the home has retained its magnicent history whilst being liveable in a church.

The Brazilian-born influencer, who boasts over a million followers on Instagram, is now delivering food and medicine in the besieged nation.Miss Gutierrez sued Brown in  over an alleged altercation in Las Vegas and won a civil lawsuit against the star after she claimed he attacked her in a hotel room. The -year-old is fighting fit having been placed in a coma by doctors in Istanbul, Turkey, after suffering a severe reaction to anaesthesia while undergoing cosmetic surgery four years ago.“I decided to come too because I couldn’t just watch what was happening from my house and do nothing,” she said. “Of course I’m scared when I’m inside Ukraine, but when I help someone I feel that I’m doing the right thing.“We take stuff to dferent places, like this hospital in Chervonohrad, some police stations in Lviv and Lutsk, and schools as well.” Ms Gutierrez claimed that those delivering food and aid were now accompanied by police escorts after the Russian army had captured some volunteers.But the scariest thing was the air-raid sirens, she said. “When I hear the siren, it is super scary because we don’t know exactly what to do,” she said. “It is impossible to get used to.” Photos and videos show Ms Gutierrez and fellow volunteers loading up supplies in a car, ready for distribution in Ukraine. Further images show her with donated goods in a Lviv warehouse, and posing with a rescued family who had crossed into Zosin, Poland. She continued: “The Ukrainian people see us volunteers as heroes. “Sometimes I feel like crying when I see families breaking apart – men over  years old can’t get out of Ukraine.  “I see all the time families with just a backpack and the documents in their hands leaving everything behind. But we can’t cry, we are here to give support to these families.” It’s unclear how many foreigners have travelled to Ukraine to assist in a humanitarian capacity.However, in an update on March , the Ukrainian Government said it had received , applications from foreigners looking to fight against Russia.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

She is said to have received around , in compensation after claiming Brown or a member of his crew assaulted her while confiscating her cell phone at a luxury party held by the RB star. At the time, TMZ reported the incident occurred after Brown caught her taking his photo at the bash at the Palms Hotel and Casino on December , . The Grammy award winning artist denied the allegations but reached an agreement after Gutierrez stepped up her claim by suing for defamation when Brown posted a video in which he said she was too ugly to have been invited to his party.

The competition was founded in  as a way to celebrate historic trees and develop bonds between nations - but organisers have found it impossible to remain separate from global politics.  At the awards ceremony on Tuesday in the Belgian capital, a -year-old oak tree in Polandaposs Bialowieza forest was crowned the winner. Judges said it had become a symbol of Polish resistance to aggression after it welcomed Ukrainian refugees fleeing the conflict. In second place was a -year-old oak in the Santiago de Compostela region of Spain, and third went to a -year-old cork oak tree in Vale do Pereiro, a village in Portugal. Earlier this year, work began on a -mile, -foot-high metal wall through the Bialowieza forest, intended to stop migrants, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, from crossing into Poland from Belarus. The tree was initially submitted into the competition as a protest.The  entrant countries - or , including Russia - mostly held their own national qualying contests to find their entry. Josef Jary, one of the organisers, said the decision to pull Russiaaposs entry was painful.“I can imagine a lot of normal Russian people without any political interest voted for their lovely tree, and they were very disappointed,” he said, reports DNYUZ. Prior to the withdrawal, Russia had won first, second or third place in all four years it had entered the competition.  In reaction to the boycott, Sergey Palchikov, Russia’s tree competition liaison, sent a letter to the organisers saying Russia would be withdrawing indefinitely. With unconcealed surprise and chagrin, we learned that the Russian tree, the famous Turgenev Oak, planted by the hands of the great Russian writer Ivan Turgenev and killed by a hurricane at the end of last year, was practically killed with your help for the second time,” Mr Palchikov wrote. However, last year the Russian entry was at the centre of a scandal, with allegedly fraudulent votes cast.  The organisers announced attempts to distort the just competition and deceitfully influence the results. Mr Palchikov said he didnapost know who was responsible for the alleged fraud. Ludek Niedermayer, a member of the European Parliament, said he fully supported the decision to ban Russia from the competition due to the invasion of Ukraine - and said any such awareness is crucial. “It makes people active, and people that are active care about what’s going on,” he said. However, Rob McBride, the British liaison of the tree competition, objected to Russiaaposs elimination, describing trees as apolitical. “I’d rather keep politics out of nature projects and trees especially,” he said. Mr McBride added he voted for the Polish and Spanish entries. Britain has never won the competition. This yearaposs entry was a hawthorn tree which was crowned British tree of the year in December last year.

Annoying berks who think that spouting sitcom catchphrases makes them characters, sticking the word “meister” on the end of surnames passes as wit, and the height of ingenuity is a prank phone call. A bit like those two Russians who rang ministers Ben Wallace, Priti Patel and Nadine Dorries. But the Putin stooges met their match. I hear after a minute of listening to Dorries they hung up thinking they were being hoaxed by someone pretending to be an MP. It makes you proud to be British.It also makes you wonder how anyone believes they could hoax members of a government told to bluff whenever their mouth opens, as witnessed in the Chancellor’s Spring Budget statement which felt more like The Great British Cock ’n’ Bull Swindle. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Here was Rishi Sunak claiming we’re ALL about to feel the pinch when as a multi-millionaire married to a billionaire, he clearly isn’t. He said he was putting “billions back into the pockets of people” when he’s making us pay the highest tax rates since  while suffering the biggest cost-of- living crisis since rationing in the early s. A fact confirmed when ­economists calculated a worker on the average annual wage of £, will be £ worse off. Pure bull, and he knows it. The decision to let energy firms escape a windfall tax on their gargantuan profits was a cruel and calculated decision by this Tory government to force low income households to choose between food and heat. Yet still they lie about levelling up being their top priority. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Their latest con is to claim our current problems are all down to Ukraine, when in reality, the economy was sliding down the pan way before the invasion due to their incompetence and nepotism. Their latest slogan is “our work begins now” which makes it sound like Labour has just left office after saddling the country with a crippling debt, when Gordon Brown moved out  years ago. They tell us they detest how obscenely PO has treated its workers, yet they voted against scrapping Fire and Rehire and signed off the legislation that allowed the Dubai-owned firm to sack  employees over Zoom.They tell us they’ve done more for refugees than any other country, then make it a criminal offence for desperate Ukrainian families to arrive in the UK without the right papers. Like David Cameron posting photos of himself volunteering at a foodbank, to make it look like poverty is close to his heart, when foodbank use went up ,% during his time as PM. There seems no limit to their capacity to insult our intelligence.A telling video emerged on Thursday of the NATO meeting in Brussels. As world leaders warmly greeted eachother, Boris Johnson stood unloved and alone, like Billy No-Mates.Further proof that the world’s politicians have discovered through painful experience that the oligarch-enabler and his ministers are just two-bit hustlers. Which is why they choose to give the British the cold shoulder. My grandad used to have a saying about people he found shady: “They’re kidding the goolies off you.” Labour should adopt that slogan for the May elections, because the overtaxed penny is surely now dropping with even the most gullible about how badly they’ve been conned.

Not long after the invasion of Ukraine, Putin ordered his nuclear deterrent forces on alert he sent several Russian submarines capable of carrying  ballistic missiles each sailed into the North Atlantic, it has emerged. At the time, nuclear experts told The Mirror that this was posturing rather than a real nuclear threat. It has now been reported they ed to Russia shortly afterwards, however western intelligence is now keeping a closer eye on Putinaposs nuclear arsenal. Putin has the largest stockpile of nuclear warheads in the world with , - thousands are thought to be classed as tactful - meaning they are intended to eliminate enemy targets in a specic area without causing widespread destruction. A navy source told The Times: The majority of Russian conventional weapons can be retrofitted with a low-yield nuclear capability. It is more complex than ‘plug and play’ but the Russians are quite innovative in what they put in front of bombs and missiles. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Putinaposs justication for invading Ukraine was to de-Nazy the country, not destroy it as experts say they donapost see evidence that the Kremlin is gearing up to launch nuclear weapons. A western official said that there had been no sign in the conflict so far of any nuclear warheads being loaded onto missiles bound for Ukraine. At the time Putin put his nuclear forces on special alert, Dr Matthew Kroenig, Director of the Scowcroft Strategy Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told Thethere were two reasons to move his weapons.  He said it so Putin would be less vulnerable to a nuclear attack with the weapons being in one place and to move them into strategic places where they can be launched from. He said: This is part of Russian strategy. I donapost think we are getting ready for a nuclear war. Itaposs like in the animal kingdom when animals make themselves look really big before a fight. What Putin is trying to do is intimidate us to say aposstay out of Ukraineapos. Dr Kroenig said that Putin used a similar strategy in  during the annexation of Crimea. He added: This development does make things more dangerous with nukes moving around, but Russia did this in  and they use nuclear deterrence as an offensive strategy.

about what seeds to plant in the next few months.It’s a very satisfying project: dig your garden, plant some seeds, watch them germinate and nurture them into strong plants that you can harvest and eat, all in the space of a few months.These joys, though, are usually only accessible to those who have their own garden or space to grow in.That’s why Time for Change member Lix Armstrong wants to start a community food growing project in Ardrishaig, giving everyone the chance to experience the many benefits of growing their own food.The project is still in its planning stages, but will hopefully take shape in the form of allotment-style raised beds, and a shared polytunnel space to grow vegetables and fruit.Not only would this food growing project reduce greenhouse gas emissions relating to food miles, packaging and chemical fertilisers, it will also reduce food waste, as people are much more likely to eat misshapen or wonky vegetables that they’ve grown themselves.Vegetables that don’t look perfect are often left to rot in fields due to supermarket demands.In fact,  per cent of all food that is produced is wasted either on farms, in supermarkets, or in people’s homes.Not only is this a huge waste of resources, it is also a big source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane.Food waste in the UK produces  million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year.Emissions aside, community food growing also comes with huge social benefits, such as allowing more people to access fresh fruits and vegetables, reducing their reliance on less healthy processed foods.It’s also great for both the mental and physical health of participants, as repetitive, rewarding tasks like gardening are proven to lower stress levels and help people feel connected both to the land and to the community.Gardening also provides a steady, low impact form of exercise that is more sustainable than when exercise itself is the main goal.Lix hopes that this project will link with community groups and local primary schools so that as many people as possible can share their learning and grow things together.Growing projects like Lix’s planned one in Ardrishaig could exist all over Argyll.Crucial to this project’s success, says Lix, will be the accessibility of the project to people in the area, security of land, and a willingness from the community for it to thrive as a long-term project.If you are interested in lending a hand, oryou have any skillsto contribute, Lix would love to hear from you, so send us an email at timeforchangeargyll@gmail and we will put you in touch.If you#d like to find out more about Time for Change Argyll and Bute, email timeforchangeargyll@gmail or visit the group#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters another

chronotypes, have a genetic basis that controls one#s biological clock, but this can be modied by ious factors such as light exposure, age and lestyle.However, when the genetic and environmental cues are not aligned a chronic condition known as #social jetlag# may ensue.This problem is exacerbated during adolescence when chronotypes become increasingly delayed, but schools start early in the morning.This can cause sleep loss that may lead to major health and psychological problems and also affect academic performance.In a recent study scientists examined how the interaction between chronotype and school start time influenced inidual academic performance* by taking advantage of a high school system where  students had been randomly assigned to lessons in the morning , afternoonor evening .This enabled the unbiased testing of the effect of chronology and school schedules on academic performance in adolescents aged - years and - years.The results showed that among the early morning group, very few students got adequate sleep.The larksoutperformed owlsin all school subjects and this effect, which increased as students progressed through the school, was most extreme in maths.This outcome, however, was not evident in those having afternoon schooling, and the situation almost reversed in those receiving evening schooling, where students with later chronotypes performed slightly better in languages than the early chronotypes in the same group.Clearly academic performance is influenced by biological iation in daily rhythms, to an extent that has previously been underestimated.The study authors, while conceding that it is impractical to attempt to fully align school timetables to inidual chronotypes, suggest that it may be possible to, for example, progressively delay school start times during adolescence.* Goldin et al.  https:doi.org . s---."},{"url":null,"title":"in columbas footsteps without cuban heels","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , :

feature Mid Argyll as it follows seven celebrities on a pilgrimage through Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland.#Pilgrimage# follows the celebs # of dferent faiths and none # for  days as they follow in the footsteps of Saint Columba, seeking out his legacy as a key figure in early British Christianity, helping spread the faith from Ireland to Scotland and beyond.Along the way Will Bayley, Scarlett Moffat, Monty Panesar, Louisa Clein, Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen, Shazia Mirza and Nick Hewer enjoyed the hospitality of the people of Knapdale.They arrived in Achahoish on September  last year, having set off from Northern Ireland the previous day by boat.Tired and weary, the pilgrims were welcomed into South Knapdale Parish Church at Achahoish, where they met with some of the congregation and shared a meal.South Knapdale Parish Church Minister Reverend David Carruthers explained: #The programme#s producers # and the visitors # had caught wind of the fact that the church in Achahoish has been used previously by pilgrim groups passing through.#The Presbytery of Argyll#s youth workers have previously arranged pilgrim walks under the banner of the Columba Experience and the church at Achahoish was used for accommodation on two successive years.#After their meal at Achahoish, the group started to share with one another something of their backgrounds, beliefs and faiths whilst the TV cameras rolled.After three hours of fascinating chat, the locals went home and the travellers bedded down on the church floors in their sleeping bags.Next day the pilgrims headed northwards via Columba#s Cave near Ellary, where Father Simon MacKenzie of Christchurch in Lochgilphead conducted a short act of worship.The celebrity pilgrims began their journey in Donegal before travelling to Argyll. From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

victory over the Aberdour seconds across in Fe.Taking advantage of the wind at Silversands, Kilmory pushed ahead with two well-taken quickfire goals from Alex Cunningham on  and  minutes to take an interval lead.There was no more scoring in the second half with both teams struggling a bit on the  sticky pitch.With Inveraray seniors# Mowi National Division match against Skye called off due to heavy rain # after the Aray lads had reached Fort William # Inveraray juniors had the option of a strong bench for their Mowi South Division Two match versus newly-formed Strachur-Dunoon.The match was reversed from the Winterton to Dunoon Stadium with the more experienced Inveraray side running out - winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement.

We believe we must take positive action now to tackle these and other challenges by helping schools to work more effectively together.#By making these changes, we believe we will protect our schools, enhance the education of our pupils and build a stronger team of educators.#But this view is challenged by parent councils across the region # and they also question the process.The council is consulting on a #proposal in principle#, and this worries parent councils representing schools in Mid Argyll and Kintyre.In a joint statement they said: #Parents and communities need to be clear that the proposal in principle does not carry any technical detail. This will only be worked out once the decision has been made to progress the model # all subject to change.#Not only can [the education authority] give us no evidence of this model working but it has not provided us with any risk assessments or proof that this will do no harm.#To make valid feedback we have to hear both sides of the story.#The statement added that when the plan was first presented to the council#s community services committee in June , it was already clear that parents opposed school clusters.#It is extraordinary that the education authority has now spent time and money using a marketing company to #sell# the same model to parents rather than thinking it worthwhile to engage parents with possible alternative models for discussion,# the statement continued.Mid Argyll councillor Dougie Philand endorsed those concerns, saying: #I believe the authority needs to listen to our communities who are clearly saying this proposal is one they do not support.#Fiona Hoad, chair of Ardrishaig Primary School Parent Council, said: #Trying to distil this down has been a process and a half. It didn#t need to be like that but it was the approach the authority took for its own end goal.#We don#t want change for change#s sake.

We are standing in response to President Zelensky’s appeal to us to come out to our squares and our streets to show solidarity with Ukraine.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous. Duplicity#s original meaning in English has to do with a kind of deception in which true feelings or intentions are hidden behind  words or actions.I wouldn’t blame the children of South Sudanthey just gave up.One third are suffering chronic malnutrition.

This will only be worked out once the decision has been made to progress the model – all subject to change.#Not only can [the education authority] give us no evidence of this model working but it has not provided us with any risk assessments or proof that this will do no harm.#To make valid feedback, we have to hear both sides of the story.#The statement added that when the plan was first presented to the council#s community services committee in June , it was already clear that parents opposed school clusters.#It is extraordinary that the education authority has now spent time and money using a marketing company to #sell# the same model to parents rather than thinking it worthwhile to engage parents with possible alternative models for discussion,# the statement continued.Suggestions have recently been made that the issue should be make-or-break for candidates in May#s council elections.Islay community councillor Calum Murray, a former teacher, said: #My feeling is to nip this in the bud, that with the elections coming up very soon in May, we should ensure that not one councillor is re-elected that would support this measure.#"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils u13s in football action","story":"Campbeltown Pupils stravelled to Clydebank to play BSC Glasgowon Sunday March , looking to follow-up on their draw with Busby the previous week.After a promising start, the Pupils found themselves - down at half-time, through a combination of poor defending, and also some good play from the BSC attackers.The young Campbeltown team rallied in the second half, and with a much better all-round performance, capped off with goals from Ryan Johnston and Ben Cunningham.Finnart #s The young Pupils# second away game in a row saw them travel on Sunday to play league leaders Finnart.The first  minutes saw the Pupils put in one of their best performances of the season, competing in every position, and they were rewarded midway through the half with a brilliant -yard strike from Ryan Johnston that found the top corner.The pace and strength of the league leaders# attackers started to cause problems, however, and two quick-fire goals gave Finnart the lead.The crucial goal came with the last kick of the half, with slack defending from the Pupils allowing Finnart to go into the break - ahead.The second half was a very even affair.

For me, it’s not just about doing something on the issue of climate change, important as that is. It’s also about extending and caring for a wood, which for me is a sacred place.Butterdean isn’t actually a remnant of ancient woodland, but parts of it have that atmosphere. It’s a planted wood but has been in existence for hundreds of years. There are references to it from the th century and earlier.It has changed over this time because parts of it have been felled and replanted, and some of the trees look like they have been coppiced. It has clearly been a woodland resource for many centuries.Its survival in itself is part of its remarkable story, of which I have previously written. But the dferent phases of management of the wood have left it with a fascinating character. Dferent parts of Butterdean Wood have dferent types of trees and atmosphere.In some areas, native deciduous trees dominate, such as silver birch, oak, hazel, ash and rowan. In others, there is a preponderance of tall non-native coners, although all over the wood there are also some wonderful examples of native Scots pine. There are also many towering beech trees, the queen of the forest. The undergrowth is lush in the deciduous sections, while the tall coners create a forest floor perfect for kids to play. I’ve met people in the wood who are lost, as there are around km of pathways crisscrossing each other.One of the special features of the wood are the old trees which can be discovered everywhere. It’s asthey had been forgotten or overlooked when their siblings were felled, or have grown quietly and unnoticed by the tree-fellers and somehow survived. We have our favourite old oak tree, for example, hidden in a corner of the wood, and the beech which still has been our umbrella for family picnics since my grown-up kids were toddlers. And now, with the careful management of the Woodland Trust, the wood is regenerating itself into an increasingly important native natural habitat.In this week’s sunny weather and lighter evenings, we were all finally able to have a weekday afternoon walk, a perfect way to unwind after a day in school. It was actually warm, with rays of sunshine streaming through the still-leafless but budding branches of the trees spring has well and truly arrived. I love such days, relish such moments in a wood.I have been called a tree hugger by some, and it is a label I accept and take as a compliment. The term may have its origins in India. In , the ruler of the Jodhpur area wanted to build a new palace, so he sent his soldiers to cut down the forest which was close to a village named Khejarli.The villagers regarded the forest as sacred because of their Bishnoi faith, but also because of what the forest gave them. They defended the trees by literally hugging them. The protest was initially led by a local woman called Amrita Devi, but hundreds of poor villagers were part of the tree-hugging protest.It was an act of incredible bravery, for Amrita, as well as  fellow villagers, were brutally killed as they hugged the trees, trying to protect them. Three of Amrita’s daughters were among the martyrs.This protest became the inspiration for the later Chipko movement in the s, when women in Uttar Pradesh likewise hugged trees to protect them from felling Chipko means ‘to embrace’.So I am proud to call myself a tree hugger, although I fear I would not have the courage or dedication to protect my sacred trees in the way Amrita and her fellow villagers did. Yet many of those currently protesting the destruction of forests and woodland all over the world, and indeed much closer to home, often have their spirit. We need many more modern-day tree huggers.But all we need to do on Saturday is head off regardless of the weather, be prepared to get a bit muddy and help plant some native trees. In doing so, we honour the dedication of those early tree huggers, in our own way, and make a dference. If you want to be part of the tree planting, please book by emailing kirstyduncan@woodlandtrust.org.ukIt will likely be busy, so please park at Alba Trees nursery rather than the usual car park.

The result has been  years during which there has been no national energy plan.Recent events have brought this situation into sharp focus and to kick-start some strategic thinking in Scotland I would make an urgent plea for the SNP Government to realise that its perfectly reasonable opposition to nuclear weapons does not need to be accompanied by stubborn opposition to nuclear generation of electricity.

I wonderthe research breaks down whether such uninformed tenants are all from the pre-December  era, before the Scottish Government’s Private Residential Tenancy Agreementswere introduced. Surely they could not be from the current PRTA era given the wealth of information with which they are deluged before a new tenancy is set up.A typical PRTA extends to some  pages, with a couple of helpful introductory pages entitled \"Know your rights\", followed by a useful index to the PRTA’s three sections, Section  being an essential Glossary of Terms and Interpretation without which the hapless parties to the agreement will not be able to understand the  clauses which comprise Section . Wading through all that eventually brings the weary parties to about page , the remaining -odd pages comprising “Easy Read Notes for the Scottish Government Model Private Residential Tenancy Agreement”, the Easy Read Notes being so easy to read that they also start with a definition of \"Agreement\" to mean \"the tenancy agreement for the property which is being leased\".The tenant must of course be given a full copy of the PRTA in prescribed form, with all its attendant notes, so one wonders why any tenant in the PRTA era could possibly be unaware of their rights. Could it just be that swamping a tenant with such information overload is a sure-fire way to guarantee that only the most diligent prospective tenant with a penchant for perusing y legal documents will ever actually read the stuff  Sometimes less is indeed more.Campbell Fullarton, Kilmarnock.MYRA AND ME  PERISH THE THOUGHTDOUG Marrsays that his last passport photo \"bore a startling resemblance to a th century serial killer\".

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He’s a quiet lad, he’s a really good lad.“You can’t even imagine how he’s feeling. You’re there for him, you try and support him as best you can, you let him know that you’re there for him, the club are there for him, but you know his family and all are back there, so it’s very dficult for him.“We’re there for him. I’m sure it’s hard for him to focus and do his job, but he is, he’s coming in training every day and doing what he can.“He’s got the support of his team-mates, any little support that we can give him.”Ireland and the Ukraine are due to meet home and away in the Nations League in June, although the hostilities mean those fixtures may not now take place – the Ukrainians were due to meet Scotland in a World Cup play-off semi-final this week.However, Coleman knows football is a secondary priority.He said: “We’re sitting here talking about them going through a lot and, really, we don’t know how much and how troublesome their le is over there, and for Myko in our place, how he actually feels, how he sleeps at night.“I’m not going to sit here and pretend I know how it feels to be there or in their situation. I’m sure football is the last thing on their mind over there.”In the meantime, both men find themselves at a club fighting for its Premier League le with only three points separating Everton from the relegation zone and  games to go.Coleman said: “We had a massive result against Newcastle and then unfortunately against Crystal Palace, it wasn’t to be.“I know the fans were frustrated and I know it’s a dficult time for everyone at the football club. But belief, hard work, fire in your belly and full determination to get out of that situation that we’re in, that’s all we can concern ourselves with.“We’ve got  games left, we’ve just got to give it everything.”"},{"url":null,"title":"under-21-boss-lee-carsley-urges-england-maintain-push  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

I’m not going to change the way I coach because I want to attack. I always played in teams who were very defensive and counter attacking, when you had  years of doing that I want to attack and put teams on the back foot.“It’s an encouragement point, they are going to keep getting chances because of the positions they are in. I have a lot of faith in them that they can be more ruthless.“The amount of time we spend with them it’s dficult to change their game overnight but we have a lot of confidence in them.“It was an OK performance. I thought we played really well at times, getting the four goals was good, we created a lot of chances and I’d like to see us be more clinical with that end product.“I want them to be ruthless in front of goal and stingy defending the goal.“It wasn’t so much what I didn’t see, you want more and, for all the attacking play, we could have scored more. That’s not being disrespectful to Andorra.“I’d like us to be a little bit more ruthless and more demanding on each other with that final pass.”England were in control from the start in Bournemouth and Balogun opened the scoring after six minutes, turning in Tino Livramento’s low cross.Noni Madueke and Harvey Elliott went close before Ramsey made it - when he drilled in after Ion Rodriguez denied Gibbs-White.Eight minutes into the second half Gibbs-White grabbed his goal when he fired in after Rodriguez failed to hold Balogun’s tame effort.Rosas made it - after  minutes but Gordon wrapped up the win with  minutes left.Livramento’s deep cross found the Everton star and he produced an excellent controlled volley to find the corner.On being  European qualiers unbeaten Carsley added: “It’s testament to the players and the staff who have coached them. It’s no mean feat and I’ve seen it first hand. It’s definitely something which is in the back of my mind and something we’re keen to keep going.”"},{"url":null,"title":"papers-say---march-26  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

All flocks which had potentially direct contact with the imported ram will now either have been treated or have begun a programme of testing.The emphasis will now be on surveillance.Farmers and crofters are asked to be especially vigilant and report any signs of sheep scab in their flocks to Shetland Vets.The early signs of sheep scab are rubbing, scratching, biting at flanks and tags of fleece pulled out.This can very much resemble lice infections. In more advanced cases, areas of bare and raw red skin or scabs become visible and there is also weight loss.Sheep that have been treated with a pour-on product for lice or keds but still remain itchy, should also be investigated.Further surveillance using blood testing will be available during the summer.Veterinary advisor for the council Hilary Burgess said: “I would like to thank the Shetland farming community for their help and co-operation with the sheep scab control operation, and most especially to thank those farmers that have gathered their sheep for testing and treatments.#I would also like to thank our contracted sheep dipping teamfor their hard work.“As a precaution, we continue to advise that sharing of equipment between flocks should be kept to a minimum and equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between holdings.“The use of separate protective clothing is also strongly recommended when working on dferent flocks or, at the very least, careful cleaning and disinfection of clothing between flocks.“With vigilance, care with biosecurity, and working together as a community we can look towards being clear of sheep scab once again.”..Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

The Minister announced that a more targeted approach to testing will be introduced on a phased basis from next month, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness. Testing will continue to be available for those eligible for COVID- treatments. Under the new policy, PCR testing will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop symptoms of COVID-. Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then. Please keep following the latest public health advice as set out on NI Direct."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1648210667218.jpg--recommendation_for_post_primary_pupils_to_wear_facemasks_to_be_scrapped_after_easter.jpg?1648210667000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220325newsrecommendation for post primary pupils to wear facemasks to be scrapped after easter","story":"It will no longer be recommended that post-primary pupils wear a face covering in corridors or confined communal areas following the Easter break. This will result in post-primary pupils no longer being recommended to wear a face covering on school premises. The news was confirmed by Education Minister Michelle McIlveen.She said, As was the case with the change relating to the use of face coverings in classrooms, this further change takes place in the context of a broadly improving epidemiological landscape in schools. Nonetheless, COVID continues to circulate in our communities and in our schools and we should continue to reduce the risks of COVID in our schools through the range of other mitigating measures that remain in place to protect all pupils and staff.  It is for this reason thatany inidual wishes to continue to use a face covering anywhere at school, I would encourage them to do so. At this point pupils will still be recommended to wear a face covering when using public or school transport. This position will be kept under review.

In addition, the NIEA, along with the department’s consulting advisors and dedicated environmental team, were on site extensively during construction,” they added. “During this period, they did not raise any concern or issues relating to either the environmental controls or working methods adopted.”The local council confirmed it was aware of an alleged breach of conditions. A spokeswoman said: “A report of an alleged pollution incident was received.

However, the latest attack signals an escalation in violent loyalist opposition to the Irish Sea border.DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson condemned the alert, saying: “Most people want to get on with their lives and have no truck with those who cling to violence”.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill said she condemned the actions of “those involved in a security alert at an event focused on peace, reconciliation and finding common ground”. “Those determined to cause instability and disruption will not succeed,” she tweeted. “Those of us committed to peace will not be deterred.”Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said it was “simply shocking”.“Apart from the irony that Mr Coveney was speaking about the suffering in Ukraine as part of his speech on reconciliation, a speech he can deliver again, a grieving family burying a loved one had to hold their funeral Mass outdoors, something that cannot be undone,” he said. “Relatives were denied their right to pay their respects as planned.” SDLP MP Claire Hanna, who was at the event, said: “The irony is lost on nobody that this was an event about reconciliation, about common ground with a genuinely erse audience of people. “That it has been disrupted in such an aggressive way is appalling.”Mr Attwood said the alert was a reminder “to everyone that there is no role in our society for violence”.Related topicsNaomi LongSimon CoveneyBrandon LewisUVFNI ProtocolMore On Naomi Long‘Palpable’ anger in police ranks over zero pay increaseCommunities Minister Hargey silent on cost of long-delayed plan to upgrade football stadiumsGreenvale Hotel tragedy: Young St Patrick’s Day disco victims are remembered three years on PremiumUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeSir Jeffrey Donaldson and Doug Beattie to share stage on youth mental health issues this weekendMost ReadStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesNorth Belfast security alert: Watch moment Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney evacuated after vehicle hijackedWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’UVF blamed for north Belfast bomb hoax aimed at Simon CoveneyOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastTop VideosPlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayVideo: UVF behind Simon Coveney north Belfast security alert say police PlayVideo: Wall collapses in north BelfastLatest Northern IrelandSteven Davis rides to the rescue as Northern Ireland flatter to deceive in late victory over LuxembourgJulian TaylorOpinionNorthern Ireland’s victory in Luxembourg masks lack of cohesion on an uninspiring evening for Ian BaracloughPO ship detained in Larne after being deemed ‘unfit to sail’Stormont Assembly election ‘most important in a generation’ – Jeffrey DonaldsonExtreme weather putting pressure on old buildings, warns expert after wall of Chinese takeaway in Belfast collapsesLatestThe Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins dies aged Briton welcomes Ukrainian refugee into his home after ‘torturous’ waitWhat the papers say – March Lizzo thanks ‘incredible women’ who took part in her new reality TV seriesWilliam suggests monarchy will respect any decision to become a republic,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSDLP’s Pat Catney joins in the celebrations singing along with campaigners, friends and family after Period Poverty Bill passes on Thursday .March   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailDon’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.It’s a motto on getting things done, striking when the iron’s hot, being proactive rather than reactive. There are a number of slogans.Anyone who has been following the frantic goings-on in the Assembly can only assume our MLAs have finally heard them. Either that or there’s an election coming up. You decide.Then again, considering what’s being done today, could it not have been done yesterday Looking at the raft of bills flowing through the chamber these past few weeks, particularly related to education, perhaps MLAs have adopted the trait of the typical student. Last-minute cramming ahead of the summer exams.With the Assembly about to wrap up its current mandate, and elections due on May , a new to-do list will emerge. Whether a great big tick can be placed beside what needs to be done, depending on whether an Executive can get up and running, is unknown, butpast experience is anything to go by, in five years there’ll be another rush of last-minute legislation.There was a to-do list five years ago. Yes, Covid will have curtailed progress on some major issues, but the reality is that MLAs have had five years of scratching their Private Members# Bills.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up You do wonder where the urgency was in . Did the itching start so suddenly at the beginning of  Instead, there has been an extensive list of bills being rushed through, some under accelerated passage which, of course, would not have been needed had the process started earlier in the mandate. And rushed legislation isn’t always for the best. Some things need y consideration.Perhaps the biggest, and certainly the most contested, was the Integrated Education Bill from Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong, which took six years of work to get to the Assembly.But in the last few weeks there has been the Flexible School Starting Age Bill, a bill to introduce CPR training as a formal part of the NI curriculum which was finally adopted as a ministerial directive, a bill on providing period products, a bill on removing the teacher exemption from fair employment legislation, and a bill to grant the Education Minister powers to dissolve the dysal General Teaching Council. That’s just within one department.And you could say, as MLAs reach the end of their five-year stint at Stormont, it’s election rush hour.In the space of a few hours, legislation on the free availability of period products, hospital car parking charges, domestic abuse safe leave from employment, the preservation of documents relating to historical institutions, safe access zones for abortion services and the fair employment of teachers were all speeding past in a blur.Sighs of relief for those who have worked to get their bills through for Royal Ascent, but maybe they made things a little harder for themselves than they needed to. Every Assembly mandate starts with the best intentions. The next one will be no dferent.While we should at least be grateful that important decisions are being made, it does all arrive with a little regret that the achievements were not being celebrated by cheering MLAs some time ago.Perhaps we should have elections more oftenwe want to get things done  Now there’s a worrying thought, but it is amazing what can be achieved when the spirit moves you.As elected MLAs reassemble, in whatever form of government the election brings come May, it would be refreshing to see the enthusiasm and the urgency to actually get things done that have been a hallmark of the final days of the current crop, bear fruit in the early days of a new administration.Last-minute winners can be more enjoyable and they do say all good things come to those who wait, but there are vital things Northern Ireland simply shouldn’t have to wait for.Related topicsMichelle McIlveenKellie ArmstrongMore On Michelle McIlveenPlymouth Brethren Christian Church’s schools merger plan for Northern Ireland rejected by Education Minister McIlveenNew single transfer test for P pupils in Northern Ireland to begin in November Education Minister confirms integrated status for Glengormley HighEducation Department urged to make good on promises as £m funding breakdown revealed£m for new school buildings plannedMost ReadStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesNorth Belfast security alert: Watch moment Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney evacuated after vehicle hijackedWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’UVF blamed for north Belfast bomb hoax aimed at Simon CoveneyOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastTop VideosPlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayVideo: UVF behind Simon Coveney north Belfast security alert say police PlayVideo: Wall collapses in north BelfastLatest PoliticsMallon labels DUP ‘a party of irrational mood swings’SDLP leader says election offers chance to break ‘cycle of crisis and collapse’Stormont’s inertia over refugees ‘puts them at risk of exploitation and abuse’Loyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPViewpointOpinionNot much help with cost of living crisisLatestBriton welcomes Ukrainian refugee into his home after ‘torturous’ waitWhat the papers say – March Lizzo thanks ‘incredible women’ who took part in her new reality TV seriesWilliam suggests monarchy will respect any decision to become a republicThis year’s Oscars telecast to feature ASL interpretation for the first time,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

While devastated with the news, Paulrsquos we, Emma, said he was determined to beat the disease but only she knew that his condition was terminal.She spoke of his final moments and how his thoughts where of her and his daughters mdash Eimear, Rachel and Evie-Grace.ldquoHe asked me not to let the three girls forget him and he told me how much he loved me.

He got his chance to DJ on his own for the first time due to a double booking.He then began to DJ regularly at the Central Park nightclub in his early s, later securing a residency in The Groovy Train at the M Club in Belfast in .Paulrsquos break into radio came in  when he became a presenter with FM in Newry, part of the Q Radio Network, later becoming a breakfast presenter and eventually operations manager.He left in  and worked freelance for three years with Downtown Radio before joining U presenting the Sunday afternoon show in .In , he took on the overnight programme from midnight until am, Monday to Thursday.Paul also was a multi-award winning wedding DJ and played regularly as the recommended DJ for the Hastings Hotel Group.OrsquoHares in Newcastle paid its condolences on social media to Paulrsquos family and friends:: lsquoDJ PK was a resident here for many years and was heavily involved in the success of Central Park and Coast nightclub entertaining generations of party goers here.rsquoAfter a service at Our Lady Of The Assumption Church in Newcastle, Paulrsquos remains left for cremation in Dardistown Crematorium in Dublin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Washed up munitions a reminder of Murlough’s military history  ","story":"THE news of a controlled explosion on Murlough beach last Thursday might sound shocking.But it isnrsquot the first time that Army bomb disposal experts have detonated a suspected WWII mortar found in County Downrsquos sands.Such ordnance washes up relatively frequently, assumed to have escaped the Beaufort Dyke trench in the Irish Sea, where massive amounts of munitions were dumped after the war mdash including  tons of four-inch mortars.But stray munitions have also been found before in Murloughrsquos sand dunes, reflecting the arearsquos rich wartime history.In fact, Murlough Nature Reserve mdash formerly known as the Dundrum Sandhills mdash has interesting history that extends far beyond WWII.The name itself comes from the old Irish word lsquoMuirbolcrsquo, meaning lsquosea-bagrsquo , and evidence of human activity in the -acre reserve extends back to around  BC.Archaeological digs in the s unearthed multiple signs of burning, hundreds of pottery shards, worked flints and even carbonised hazelnut shells that confirm Neolithic and Bronze Age activity.Much later, Murloughrsquos dunes were important for the Normans. They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

Such dedication is a hallmark of the Northern Ireland football captain’s career and has led her to making history with her squad as they head to the Women’s Euro  finals. But ahead of Mother’s Day she also has an inspiring, important message for the next generation of female sporting stars - being both mother and top athlete is possible.Marissa said: “It’s so important for women in sport to know thatthey want to have kids it can happen. That women do believe it is possible to have kids and have a career in sport.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On our team we have Sarah McFadden, and she has a wee girl Harper, . She came back and played an international match three months after she gave birth. “It’s raising the awareness and telling the stories that it is possible so we can inspire the next generation of women in sport.”Growing up in west Belfast in a time when an international women’s football side wasn’t even in existence, never mind a possibility, it’s little wonder the passionate player has become a role model for women in sport and for the next generation of female athletes.“I do take pride in inspiring the next generation of girls coming up,” said Marissa.“Football has given me so much in my journey, I love to show young girls that it’s a great sport to be in. But not just football but any sport – the le lessons you learn – you can’t put a price on it. “Football’s my passion and I just want to let young girls know that football is great for your mental and physical health. I don’t know where I would be without it.”However, despite great strides being made in sport the statistics show there is still work to do. A signicant gap between men and women taking part in sport still exists, with women less likely to have taken part in sport at least once within the last year, %, than men, %. Unfortunately, according to Sport NI figures this gap gets wider on our sidelines with women representing just .% of the overall sports coaching workforce in Northern Ireland and this dropping to just % for those who coach our World, Olympic or Paralympic medallists.To help close this gap Sport NI recently launched their Women In Sport Panel that sees women from dferent sporting backgrounds offering their expertise on how to overcome barriers and create more opportunities for women and girls at all levels of sport.Marissa believes that listening to women and funding in sport are key factors in closing the gap.“It’s so important to listen to women from all levels of sport to be able to improve experiences and see what we can do better. This  also gives visibility to women who are in sport, coaching, leadership, and governance levels. That is so very important for females to see these real-le scenarios and see that it’s possible to achieve these roles.”Marissa points to Angela Platt, Irish Football AssociationDirector of Women’s Football and Women In Sport Panel member, as an inspiring example.“It is very powerful to have a female in the director’s role and to have that role created for the first time, especially as football is still very male dominated,” she said.The Cltonville player coach, who is mum to Quinn, , seems to have found the enviable balance between family le and her job on the pitch. She’s quick to credit her supportive partner Paula and the recent funding from the IFA, sponsors, and the Department for Communitiesfor helping make that work – le balance happen.“In January we got fully funded to train professionally. So those who were working fulltime got put on secondment and are training up at Newforgefulltime,” she explained.It means that Marissa’s job as the IFA’s Girls’ Participation Officer has been put on hold until September, after the World Cup qualiers next month and the Euros in July. “That has been a massive gamechanger for me.”Not only is it allowing Marissa, and the rest of the women’s international team to concentrate on their game, but for the captain she’s getting precious time with her little boy.“I’m able to drop him off and pick him up at creche. We get home, make dinner and have normal family le. Whereas before we got the investment to go fulltime you were working in your day job and were out most evenings. My partner was doing an awful lot whereas now it’s nice to have that family time. “I’m fortunate to have a supportive partner there who understands what it means to play at this level. Obviously, we go away a lot so that can be tough. “But at the same time, I know that I do it for the love of the game – it’s my thing. For our Quinn, I just think it will be amazing for him to look back on. I know he’s only two now but at least I’ll have a great story to tell him. It’s better for him to believe he can do anything.“We as the women’s international team have made our dreams come true in what we have achieved. I think it’s important for him to see his mum achieve what we have achieved and hopefully that will inspire him when he’s older.”As Quinn chats away in the background Marissa reveals he’s already showing some promise with his feet.“Quinn loves football. We have footballs of all sizes and shapes here. He’s ‘mama football’ and we play away. He does associate football with me so when football is on TV, he’s ‘mama, mama.’”As for now Marissa is the first to admit she’s “living the dream”.She has the Euros to look forward to and the World Cup qualiers coming up against Austria, April , and England, April .“We’re solely focused on getting into that squad and getting the squad prepared for those big games. They’re two unbelievable sides and two massive games so we have to make sure we’re fully ready for it,” she added.“The momentum we’ve built here within the women’s game here is incredible. If you look back three years ago, we would have had maybe  people watching us play. Obviously off the back of our success and qualying for the Euros there are over , tickets sold for the England game at Windsor. “It’s really hard to believe. I definitely think it’ll be an emotional day when we’re there at Windsor with that many fans.“There’s a lot to look forward to.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

A plan to redevelop the venue into a ,-capacity stadium has been beset by delay and controversy.The contents of the letter provoked a backlash from other executive parties, including UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt who claimed Mr Lyons was acting prematurely in discounting support for the bid, and Sinn Fein’s John Finucane who said a “can do attitude” was needed.However, a Department for Economy spokesperson later told the News Letter that “departmental officials remain involved in the process,” and added: “The Minister fully supports our involvement in any bid, but, as Northern Ireland enters the pre-election period it will be for a new Executive to formally agree our participations.“While there are clearly obstacles in place at the moment, the Minister is confident these can be overcome.” Gordon LyonsNorthern IrelandIrelandDUPGAA  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBryson dubs Simon Coveney a ‘meddling aggressor’ saying the Dublin government ‘swans around NI asthey own the place’Irish League football legend David Jeffrey ‘giving up the day job’UDA probe: PSNI welcome sentences handed down to father and son after drugs seizureJamie Bryson seeks legal action against Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill on Northern Ireland ProtocolMessage purportedly from Saoradh calls for counter-demo during tonight’s Protocol rally in DungannonMost PopularBest head torches UK : bright, reliable head torches for camping, hiking, and mountaineering of the best duvets for winter UK: how to chose, synthetic, down or wool fill, and what tog to keep cosy What’s going to happen in Season  of Netflix’s Bridgerton: what happens in Julia Quinn’s novels, where to buyLEGO launch new Back to the Future DeLorean set with Marty and Doc figures for Best walking shoes for women UK : ladies’ hiking shoes from Merrell, Keen, Scarpa and On                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMr Drakeford was speaking while defending the news that compulsory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport in Wales will end on Monday - despite cases rising due to a new iant of the virus.During a press conference this lunchtime, Mr Drakeford said that, while people will no longer be legally required to wear masks on public transport or in retail settings from Monday, the Welsh Governments ‘strong advice’ would be to continue to wear them.He also confirmed that from the same date, there will be no legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive for the virus, and issued the same ‘strong advice’ that people should do it.He said to help with people continuing to isolate, the £ isolation payment for families on low incomes would remain in place until June and that free lateral flow testing for people who think they have symptoms will also remain available.When askednow was the right time to do this considering the increase in cases relating to the BA strain of covid – which Mr Drakeford called “more transmissible than the omicron iant” – the first minister responded that it had previously been planned to end all restrictions in this weeks review, but he and his cabinet felt they were unable to do so due to the increase in cases.He likened the move to other viruses including measles.“We have to manage it like we would other conditions,\" he said. \"If you have measles, you wouldn’t go to work with it. That’s not law, it’s what is right.”He also called on the public to be sensible and use what they have learnt over the past two years. Mr Drakeford said: “For a disease that is moving from being pandemic to endemic, the public response has to move as well.“Because the cases are higher than expected, we are not able to move beyond that place and that is why we have not fully removed the restrictions..remove“People are able to do the right thing from their experience of two years of the virus and our strong advice as well.”MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford also highlighted how, unlike in Wales, it was never a legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive covid test in Scotland, and yet isolation levels were not reported to be lower compared to other nations.He also urged employers to not force their staff into workthey test positive after the self-isolation period ends.“No employer should put their staff in that position,\" he said. \"They shouldn’t do it for all the public health reasons, but they shouldn’t do it for their business either.”He continued: “If you force an employee to go in, all that will happen is more people will get infected and then the business will be infected and affected.”What are the changes From Monday, March , it will not be a legal requirement to wear masks on public transport and in retail settings, although it is still strongly advised.From the same date, it will not be a legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive, but again it is strongly advised.The £ isolation payment for low-income families will continue until June. It is hoped that this will continue furtherit is needed and the funds from the UK government allow.Free lateral flow tests will be available in Wales until around June but it is hoped they will be available longer depending on UK government funding.You must still wear a mask in all health and social care settings unless exempt.Businesses must continue to carry out risk assessments and implement measures to prevent covid spreading as much as possible.Bosses should not force employees who have tested positive for covid to go into work.Teachers, staff and secondary school pupils should wear continue to wear masks for the rest of the term.The next review will take place on Thursday, April . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe -year-old Ukraine international joined the Toffees from Dynamo Kiev in January and has found himself looking on helplessly from Merseyside at horric images of the raging war.Coleman, currently on international duty with the Republic of Ireland, said: “Myko, he’s a fantastic lad. He’s a quiet lad, he’s a really good lad.“You can’t even imagine how he’s feeling. You’re there for him, you try and support him as best you can, you let him know that you’re there for him, the club are there for him, but you know his family and all are back there, so it’s very dficult for him.“We’re there for him. I’m sure it’s hard for him to focus and do his job, but he is, he’s coming in training every day and doing what he can.“He’s got the support of his team-mates, any little support that we can give him.”Ireland and the Ukraine are due to meet home and away in the Nations League in June, although the hostilities mean those fixtures may not now take place – the Ukrainians were due to meet Scotland in a World Cup play-off semi-final this week.However, Coleman knows football is a secondary priority.He said: “We’re sitting here talking about them going through a lot and, really, we don’t know how much and how troublesome their le is over there, and for Myko in our place, how he actually feels, how he sleeps at night.“I’m not going to sit here and pretend I know how it feels to be there or in their situation. I’m sure football is the last thing on their mind over there.”In the meantime, both men find themselves at a club fighting for its Premier League le with only three points separating Everton from the relegation zone and  games to go.Coleman said: “We had a massive result against Newcastle and then unfortunately against Crystal Palace, it wasn’t to be..remove“I know the fans were frustrated and I know it’s a dficult time for everyone at the football club.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFolarin Balogun, Jacob Ramsey, Morgan Gibbs-White and Anthony Gordon eased the Young Lions to victory and ensured they made it  European qualication games unbeaten.Albert Rosas pulled a goal back mid-way through the second half but the Young Lions kept Group G leaders the Czech Republic in their sights.They are three points behind with two games in hand and Carsley has urged his side to find more killer instinct.He said: “We have to find a way of winning on the front foot. I’m not going to change the way I coach because I want to attack. I always played in teams who were very defensive and counter attacking, when you had  years of doing that I want to attack and put teams on the back foot.“It’s an encouragement point, they are going to keep getting chances because of the positions they are in. I have a lot of faith in them that they can be more ruthless.“The amount of time we spend with them it’s dficult to change their game overnight but we have a lot of confidence in them.“It was an OK performance. I thought we played really well at times, getting the four goals was good, we created a lot of chances and I’d like to see us be more clinical with that end product.“I want them to be ruthless in front of goal and stingy defending the goal.“It wasn’t so much what I didn’t see, you want more and, for all the attacking play, we could have scored more. That’s not being disrespectful to Andorra.“I’d like us to be a little bit more ruthless and more demanding on each other with that final pass.”England were in control from the start in Bournemouth and Balogun opened the scoring after six minutes, turning in Tino Livramento’s low cross.Noni Madueke and Harvey Elliott went close before Ramsey made it - when he drilled in after Ion Rodriguez denied Gibbs-White.Eight minutes into the second half Gibbs-White grabbed his goal when he fired in after Rodriguez failed to hold Balogun’s tame effort..removeRosas made it - after  minutes but Gordon wrapped up the win with  minutes left.Livramento’s deep cross found the Everton star and he produced an excellent controlled volley to find the corner.On being  European qualiers unbeaten Carsley added: “It’s testament to the players and the staff who have coached them. It’s no mean feat and I’ve seen it first hand. It’s definitely something which is in the back of my mind and something we’re keen to keep going.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Under- boss Lee Carsley urges England to maintain push article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The Minister announced that a more targeted approach to testing will be introduced on a phased basis from next month, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness. Testing will continue to be available for those eligible for COVID- treatments. Under the new policy, PCR testing will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop symptoms of COVID-. Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.

This will result in post-primary pupils no longer being recommended to wear a face covering on school premises. The news was confirmed by Education Minister Michelle McIlveen.She said, As was the case with the change relating to the use of face coverings in classrooms, this further change takes place in the context of a broadly improving epidemiological landscape in schools. Nonetheless, COVID continues to circulate in our communities and in our schools and we should continue to reduce the risks of COVID in our schools through the range of other mitigating measures that remain in place to protect all pupils and staff.  It is for this reason thatany inidual wishes to continue to use a face covering anywhere at school, I would encourage them to do so. At this point pupils will still be recommended to wear a face covering when using public or school transport. This position will be kept under review.  A guidance note will issue to schools on this issue later today and my Department’s COVID guidance will be updated to reflect this position.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddfacbfeaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_effbefbcfabfdeefe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
