Spending as much time indoors as we all have lately, setting it up is something that would improve my life immeasurably. A competent friend of mine helped me get the projector up in my last place. But between lockdowns and just plain asking too many DIY-related favours from the poor guy, I realised if I wanted to put something up on the wall, I was very much on my own. So I did what all humans do in times of need: I turned to the internet. Being an older millennial, I’d assumed that TikTok was beyond me. It’s the place where young people mime to music, right? Could the TikTok community really help? I have to confess, I was sceptical. To test the water, I decided to see what help I could get for putting up a picture – using hashtags to search TikTok for relevant videos. The picture I sought to hang is a wonderful illustration of my beloved cat Itzi, to serve as a constant reminder of who’s boss in the house. So it wasn’t something I wanted to mess up. To start with, I find a top tip from Kim, a home decor blogger who posts TikTok videos under the handle @clippercityhouse. She suggests filming myself holding a picture at different heights to decide on where I should place it. This is a great idea if you’re working on your own – as I was.I put the hook in the wall, and move on to the fiddly part of trying to get the hanging wire over. After struggling for a bit, @goodleyearth comes to the rescue with his tip to use an unexpected item of cutlery. Under calm tutelage, I place a fork upright on the nail and use it as a guide to get the picture on – I get it right the first time. Now this is the stuff I’m here for! I discover that DIY videos on TikTok are like having access to countless experts sharing learned knowledge, saving hours of misery, frustration and unnecessary holes in the wall. No more skipping through long, painful videos trying to find the relevant 30 seconds. After some nervous tea drinking, the picture of Itzi remains vertical. And so bolstered with caffeine and perhaps too much confidence, I set my sights on the shelf for my projector. After a quick search, I find that @haizzly has a useful video about prepping and priming wood. Soon the board is sanded, primed, sanded again, painted (is it starting to sound like I know what I’m doing yet?) and left to dry overnight. Woodshop Diaries – under the handle @woodshopdiaries – shows me how to drill wood without splitting, and even takes me through the basics of how a drill works in a cheerful and straightforward way. While it’s not necessarily essential for this particular task, it was a nice touch I really appreciated. And @constructiontips proves to be a treasure trove of, well, construction tips. Most of them are for tasks far above even my most lofty ambitions – however, there is a nifty trick I can see myself using in the future. It’s actually intended for picture hanging, but works well enough for a small shelf. Using tape and cardboard, I mark the drill points and have a template of where to drill the wall. Minimal fuss and no scrawling. Next, I check out @mcp_thats_me, who gives a brilliantly efficient overview of getting screws in the wall. Once this is done, I’m finally able to mount the shelf. The other useful thing about these TikTok tutorials is that they play on a loop, which is particularly handy if your hands are covered in paint, or you’re holding something heavy.A few days later, the shelf is still standing, the projector is working as it should and the wall is looking more interesting than it has in a long time. As I sit, I start to think about other projects that could now be possible. Revarnishing a coffee table? My previous doubts abated, I fire up TikTok to find out.

Walt Disney World and Universal Studios Orlando allowed customers to move around outside without masks, unless on a ride, in a line or on transport.  Major shops have also been announcing that they will be letting in customers without masks, including Walmart, Trader Joe’s and Costco.  Prompted by growing levels of vaccinations, the new guidelines remove the requirement to wear masks apart from in crowded indoor settings. PA media reports that a councillor in Bolton had to delete a tweet telling younger people “anyone” could get a jab if they turned up at a vaccination centre, as “the team will find a reason to vaccinate you”. Bolton council has been pushing for over-18s to be vaccinated but Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said vaccines should not be directed away from more vulnerable groups.  There was also confusion in neighbouring Blackburn with Darwen, where the council backtracked on an announcement that all over-18s would be vaccinated from next week.“Bodies have been recovered from rivers in many places,” said Manoj Kumar Singh, a senior official in northern state Uttar Pradesh, in a letter seen by Reuters. “The administration has information that bodies of those who have succumbed to Covid-19 or any other disease are being thrown into rivers instead of being disposed of as per proper rituals.” Experts are concerned about undetected cases in Uttar Pradesh villages and Singh’s letter asked village officials and police to stop families from throwing their dead into rivers.  He said poor families would be given 5,000 rupees (£48) to cremate bodies. A lack of materials for cremation could be part of the reason for the practice, as well as religious traditions for some and fears about becoming infected, Singh’s memo said. While climbs continue on the Nepalese side, China cancelled the 2021 spring climbing season from the Tibetan side of the mountain. Mira Acharya, director of Nepal’s tourism department, denied the severity of the situation at the base camp.  “Doctors at the base camp said the situation was not as serious as it was reported,” she told Reuters.

Visitors will have to show proof of a negative test taken up to 72 hours before a flight and airlines will be fined between €500 ($607) and €2,000 for each passenger who boards without presenting proof of a negative test. Portugal currently only allows essential flights for professional, study, family reunion, health or humanitarian reasons.  Travellers from countries where 500 or more cases per 100,000 people have been reported over a 14-day period can only enter Portugal if they have a valid reason, such as for work or healthcare.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Laura HuttonThe The Portobello Plaza in Dublin is being closed this weekend and gardaí will be mounting an operation to prevent large crowds gathering there over the weekend.Dublin City Council last month urged people to stop gathering at the plaza to drink as antisocial behaviour and littering had been an increasing problem, with many residents complaining to the council and Garda.In recent weeks gardaí have stepped up patrols in the area and confiscated alcohol being consumed in public. However, the council has now decided to close the plaza this weekend. The decision will be reviewed next week, it said.Portobello Plaza is located in Dublin’s south inner city on the banks of the Grand Canal and has proven a popular gathering location since the pandemic resulted in pubs being closed.The council said it “regrets” the decision and urged people not to come to the plaza as a Garda operation would be in place to keep it closed and clear.“Dublin City Council is very aware of the importance of public spaces in recent times but some behaviour at this location in recent weeks has been completely unacceptable. Up to a thousand people have congregated in the area on recent weekends, without due regard for Covid-19 restrictions,” it said.“The associated antisocial behaviour is having a hugely detrimental effect on both the local community and the environment,” it added, explaining it had consulted with the Garda, public representatives and local residents.The plaza was due to close early on Friday until Monday morning.However, Liam Ryan, owner of the Lower Deck pub, which faces onto the square, said the measure threatened local businesses who benefit from people using the space.Takeaway pintsHe said pub staff have served takeaway pints from the door of the premises following requests from local residents to do so, adding that his relationship with people living in the area was very good.“We only serve for five evenings a week, for three or four hours, and if it’s too busy we just close up,” he said.“The problem would be very limited if there was enough portaloos put out, it’s as simple as that.”Local Labour councillor Kevin Donoghue said that while there were problems with ongoing antisocial behaviour, notably public urination, he did not support the closure and has suggested the creation of a space that could be closed at night.The council said it was illegal to drink alcohol in a public place under city council bylaws, adding there would be increased Garda enforcement in Portobello this week and that “anyone found consuming alcohol outdoors in a public space may be fined”.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the issues around Portobello were as much about antisocial behaviour and littering and people drinking on a public street, which is against the law. “The fundamental advice we’re giving people is meeting outdoors is much much safer than meeting indoors,” he said.Traffic arrangementsMeanwhile, new traffic arrangements to facilitate outdoor dining and provide additional space for pedestrians are being trialled in Dublin city centre this weekend.Under the arrangements, which are in place from 6am on Saturday until 11pm on Sunday, there will be one lane of traffic on Merrion Row serving traffic from Kildare Street.Traffic from St Stephen’s Green East will be erted via Hume Street and Ely Place, where the direction of the traffic will be reversed. Traffic from Merrion Square seeking to head into the Stephen’s Green area and car parks will be erted via Pembroke Street and Leeson Street. Redirected bus route information is available on the Dublin Bus website.The arrangements are being trialled to facilitate outdoor dining, the council said.“The decision to proceed with the trial was made following a recent public consultation that received almost 2,400 submissions, with 93 per cent of respondents in favour.”The council said if the trial is successful a design can then be finalised in the coming weeks which would allow for accessible footpath extensions on both sides of Merrion Row to facilitate outdoor dining this summer.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"the cork fishmonger who met the queen i think there was a sense we crossed a bridge","story":" Pat O’Connell meets Queen Elizabeth at his fish counter in the English Market in 2011: “There comes a time when you have to say ‘It’s time to move on’.”Looking back on his moments with Queen Elizabeth in the English Market, Cork fishmonger Pat O’Connell says the reception she received marked Ireland’s growing maturity and its willingness to view Britain in a new light.“We are influenced by history and we won’t forget history but there comes a time when you have to say ‘It’s time to move on’. And at the end of the day, we have more in common with Britain than what separates us,” he says.The encounter between the two was perhaps the apogee of her visit a decade ago this week, where she broke into a smile of genuine warmth as O’Connell quipped about calling an ugly monkfish, “the mother-in-law fish”.Deteriorating linksBut that was then and this is now. O’Connell is an astute observer of politics and is in no doubt that Anglo-Irish relations have deteriorated since, spurred by Brexit and everything that has happened since.He puts the blame at British prime minister Boris Johnson’s door: “In many ways, I think Boris is a mini-Trump. He doesn’t speak the truth and he is more interested in himself than his country and he’s sold a pup in a lot of ways.“He said it wouldn’t hurt Britain to be out of Europe but I think it’s created huge difficulties for Britain.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe A large number of demonstrators gathered on O’Connell Street, before marching to the Israeli embassy on Pembroke Road in Ballsbridge.By the time the crowd reached the embassy it had grown from hundreds to thousands of protesters, many waving Palestinian flags.While there was widespread wearing of face coverings, social distancing measures were often impossible given the numbers involved in the demonstration.Ihab Ijawi (54), whose family was forced to leave Palestine, said it was “very stressful” watching news of children and families “being destroyed” in the current conflict.Mr Ijawi, who was born in a refugee camp in Lebanon and has lived in Ireland for nearly 20 years, said he was “concerned about every person in Palestine”.“Settlers are taking the Palestinians’ homes which under the United Nations law should not be allowed and must not be allowed,” he told The .“I know that the Irish people are really very supportive of the Palestinian issue, because they have been in this issue for a long period of time, 800 years, so they understand,” he said.There was a small Garda presence at the protest, which heard chants of “Free Palestine” from the crowd, and calls to boycott Israel.A number of People Before Profit TDs attended the march, including Bríd Smith and Richard Boyd Barrett, who called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in a speech at the protest.Mr Boyd Barrett said the large turnout was an “enormous show of support” for Palestine, and showed Irish people were “horrified at what Israel is doing”.“Everybody is wearing their masks, and the organisers went out of their way to encourage people to wear their masks and stay compliant,” he later told The .It was “understandable” that people wanted to protest, despite Covid-19 restrictions on large gatherings. “When children are being killed . . . People’s feelings overwhelm them, so I can understand that,” he said.Some crowds around Cork today in support of Palestine 🇵🇸 🇮🇪 Flags, jerseys, and chants all over Leeside. pic.twitterM835kUz1ip— Dylan O\u0027Connell (@JudgeDyl) Big protest for Palestine in Dublin Center pic.twitterGpxm8Y9SbV— Razan Ibraheem (رزان) (@RazanIreland) Chants of Free, Free Palestine from the crowd of thousands gathered in Dublin pic.twitterwh5morVKWR— Jack Power (@jackpowerIT) The Israeli embassy was not available for comment on Saturday.At an Oireachtas committee hearing earlier this week, Ophir Kariv, Israel’s ambassador to Ireland, accused some Irish politicians of spewing “hate” towards the Jewish state.Mr Kariv told the committee that Israel was willing to go “all the way” to reach a “final agreement” to end its conflict with Palestinians. However, the ambassador said his country would continue to defend its citizens during the current surge in bloodshed between Israel and neighbouring Gaza-strip militants.Posts on social media showed other sizeable demonstrations taking place in Belfast, Cork and Galway.In response to the escalating levels of violence in the region, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney tweeted on Saturday: “32 children killed since Monday in #Gaza by Israeli fire - that’s approx 14 of all fatalities - It’s not acceptable! Israel has int. legal obligation to protect children in conflict \u0026amp r not doing so! #Ireland will speak forcefully again at UNSC tomorrow.”Meanwhile, other solidarity rallies have taken place in different cities around the world. In central London, hundreds of people marched in solidarity with the people of Palestine amid the ongoing conflict.Organisers said “immediate action” was needed by the UK government to help end the “brutal” violence against the Palestinian people.Demonstrators there arrived at Hyde Park near Marble Arch before marching to the Israeli embassy, holding banners and chanting.Among those expected to address the protest are former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott and Zarah Sultana.The demonstration in London was organised by Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Friends of Al-Aqsa, Palestinian Forum in Britain, Stop The War Coalition, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Muslim Association of Britain.A spokesperson for the organisers of this protest said: “It is vital that the UK government takes immediate action.“It must stop allowing Israel’s brutal violence against and oppression of the Palestinian people to go unpunished.“The bombardment of Gaza which is killing civilians including children is a war crime.“The UK Government is complicit in these acts as long as it continues to offer Israel military, diplomatic and financial support.”Greek police fired tear gas and water cannon on Saturday to disperse pro-Palestinian demonstrators protesting in Athens against Israeli attacks on Gaza.Hundreds of people shouting “Freedom to Palestine” and waving Palestinian flags marched to the Israeli embassy, which was cordoned off by police buses.The demonstration in the Greek capital follows similar protests in cities around the world following days of intense conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza.A further several thousand people marched in Sydney and hundreds in Melbourne on Saturday.In Sydney, protesters gathered at Town Hall to march through the streets, chanting slogans such as “Free, free Palestine” and “Free, free Gaza”.“I see an uprising,” said one protester in Sydney, Walla Abu-Eid. “I see people who are no longer going to remain silent. People who are fed up, people who are responding to oppression and violence by standing up for themselves.”In Melbourne, protesters gathered at the State Library of Victoria and then marched to Parliament House, many carrying “Free Palestine” posters.At least 132 people have been killed in Gaza since Monday, including 32 children and 21 women, Palestinian medical officials said.Eight people have been killed in Israel, including six civilians, among them two children, Israeli authorities said. – Additional reporting PAReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"china completes historic mars spacecraft landing","story":"An illustration of China’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft and Zhurong rover on the surface of Mars. Image: Xinhua News Agency via Getty ImagesAn uncrewed Chinese spacecraft successfully landed on the surface of Mars on Saturday, state news agency Xinhua reported, making China the second space-faring nation after the United States to land on the red planet.The Tianwen-1 spacecraft landed on a site on a vast plain known as Utopia Planitia, “leaving a Chinese footprint on Mars for the first time,” Xinhua said.Chinese president Xi Jinping issued a message of congratulations to all the people involved in the mission.“You were brave enough for the challenge, pursued excellence and placed our country in the advanced ranks of planetary exploration,” he said. “Your outstanding achievement will forever be etched in the memories of the motherland and the people.”The craft left its parked orbit at about 6pm on Friday, Irish time. The landing module separated from the orbiter three hours later and entered the Martian atmosphere, the official China Space News said.It said the landing process consisted of “nine minutes of terror” as the module decelerates and then slowly descends.The official landing time was 18 minutes past midnight, Irish time, Xinhua said, citing the China National Space Administration. The rover took more than 17 minutes to unfold its solar panels and antenna and send signals to ground controllers more than 320 million kilometres away.The rover, named Zhurong, will now survey the landing site before departing from its platform to conduct inspections. Named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, Zhurong has six scientific instruments including a high-resolution topography camera.It will study the planet’s surface soil and atmosphere. Zhurong will also look for signs of ancient life, including any sub-surface water and ice, using a ground-penetrating radar.First independent missionTianwen-1 or “Questions to Heaven”, after a Chinese poem written two millennia ago, is China’s first independent mission to Mars. A probe co-launched with Russia in 2011 failed to leave the Earth’s orbit.The five-tonne spacecraft blasted off from the southern Chinese island of Hainan in July last year, launched by the powerful Long March 5 rocket.After more than six months in transit, Tianwen-1 reached the red planet in February where it had been in orbit since.If Zhurong is successfully deployed, China would be the first country to orbit, land and release a rover in its maiden mission to Mars.Tianwen-1 was one of three that reached Mars in February, with US rover Perseverance successfully touching down on February 18th in a huge depression called Jezero Crater, more than 2,000km away from Utopia Planitia.Hope – the third spacecraft that arrived at Mars in February this year – is not designed to make a landing. Launched by the United Arab Emirates, it is currently orbiting above Mars gathering data on its weather and atmosphere.The first successful landing ever was made by Nasa’s Viking 1 in July 1976 and then by Viking 2 in September that year. A Mars probe launched by the former Soviet Union landed in December 1971, but communication was lost seconds after landing.China is pursuing an ambitious space programme. It is testing reusable spacecraft and is also planning to establish manned lunar research station.In a commentary published on Saturday, Xinhua said China was “not looking to compete for leadership in space” but was committed to “unveiling the secrets of the universe and contributing to humanity’s peaceful use of space.” – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view uk election can things get better for labour","story":"Are the UK\u0027s Labour Party facing an existential crisis?

But in wards with a lower uptake – where more than one in five are refusing the jab – the rate increases to 261 cases per 100,000. On average, case rates are around three times higher in low vaccination areas.Recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that Muslims are less likely to agree to have the jab. While 93.2 per cent of Christians accepted a vaccine – the highest of any religion – 78.8 per cent of Muslims agreed to do so.In areas such as Blackburn, where the Indian variant is taking hold, nearly one third of the population is Muslim. The Government has been working with Imams to increase trust in the vaccine programme. There are three versions of the Indian variant in Britain, and it is B.1.617.2 which is spreading quickly.  This version carries a mutation on the spike protein, which the virus uses to latch onto human cells, and the change may help it spread more easily.However, it is missing a different mutation carried by the South African variant, which allows it to evade immunity from an infection or vaccination. Latest data from Public Health England (PHE) shows four people have died after testing positive for the Indian variant so far, a case fatality rate of 0.3 per cent. In contrast, the EnglishKent variant has a case fatality rate of two per cent.Although it may be too early to compare the death rates, experts say the Indian variant has been in Britain for long enough now to start causing a rise in hospital admissions if it was resulting in severe disease. Yet even in areas in which infection rates are rising, there has been no subsequent rise in admissions.Prof Robert Dingwall, who sits on the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation, said: “Given that it’s typically seven days to symptomatic infection, the Indian variant has been around long enough for hotspot communities to be seeing a rise in admissions, but we haven’t seen any uptick. We have a rise in reported infections, but that does not seem to be translating into hospitalisations.”However, reinfection rates are an area of concern. According to PHE, some 13 people – one per cent of all cases – have become infected with the Indian variant after already suffering a Covid infection, suggesting the mutated virus may be evading immunity. In contrast, just 0.2 per cent of people becoming infected with the Kent variant had a previous infection.Yet the good news is that it appears that vaccination is keeping the Indian variant under control. According to PHE’s Siren study, looking at healthcare workers, there is no sign of an increase in infection post-vaccination. Vaccinated medics in India also appear to be protected.Figures also show that in hotspots such as Blackburn, the variant is spreading far more quickly in the under-60s, suggesting vaccination is protecting the older population. Lab studies suggest that, although it may be able to evade immunity slightly more than the Kent variant, it is not as good at doing so as the South African variant – and vaccines still work to some extent against that mutation.On Thursday, Boris Johnson refused to rule out imposing local lockdowns in areas with a high number of cases.However, areas in which the Indian variant is surging are not only associated with low vaccine rates but also deprivation and a high level of manufacturing and key worker jobs.Analysis has revealed that workplace outbreaks are more likely to occur in manufacturing sectors and warehouses, so it is no coincidence that areas such as the West Midlands – which relies heavily on manufacturing jobs – remained in lockdown measures for much of last year, without a fall in case rates.It suggests lockdowns are unlikely to make the situation better because many people are unable to work from home. While 57.2 per cent of Londoners can do their jobs from home, only 35.3 per cent in the West Midlands can, according to the ONS. Experts are also concerned that surge vaccination will risk slowing down the overall programme and could pose a threat of allowing the variant to become established elsewhere.Narrowing the gap between vaccinations from 12 weeks to eight could also prove problematic. A study by the University of Birmingham, published this week, showed the three-month gap increased antibody levels by three and a half times compared to a three-week gap.Modelling by the University of Warwick suggests the NHS is still in danger of being overwhelmed if the Indian variant is much more transmissible than the Kent strain.A variant that is 40 per cent more transmissible could create a peak of 6,000 hospitalisations per day in August – far exceeding the January peak of 3,768. And if the mutated virus was 50 per cent more transmissible it would seriously hamper the ability of vaccines to prevent spread, leading to between 10,000 and 20,000 admissions per day, Warwick predicted.The models say that even if the final lockdown release is delayed, hospitalisations in England would still reach between 5,000 and 14,000 a day, but experts warn there is huge uncertainty about the estimates and far lower peaks are possible.Latest data from PHE suggests the Indian variant is at least as transmissible as and may out-compete the Kent variant. And while other variants have struggled to get a foothold, the Indian mutation had eclipsed the South African variant within 40 days of arriving.Yet it is still in the minority. Across England as a whole, the Indian variant now makes up approximately 6.1 per cent of sequenced cases, while 91.4 per cent of sequences are still the dominant B.1.1.7. Kent variant.Boris Johnson has consistently said the roadmap is irreversible and, having committed to lifting restrictions on May 17, it is unlikely the Government will U-turn now.On Friday, Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, said there was currently no evidence that the Indian variant escapes the vaccines or is having a more severe impact on people.And although there are a few pockets where infections are rising, latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that overall infection rates are continuing to fall. In England in the week ending May 8, the ONS estimates around 40,800 had an infection, or one in 1,340 people – down from one in 1,180 the previous week.Prof Dingwall said: “The Government needs to hold its nerve rather than allow itself to be pushed to measures that are unnecessary, demoralising and won’t work.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"complimenting foreign students english microaggression says","story":"Lecturers should not compliment a foreign student’s English because it is a potentially racist “microaggression”, leading universities have said.Saying “you speak English so well” or “you’re so articulate” to an ethnic minority student carries an assumption that white people are more intelligent, according to Imperial College London, as it issues staff with a list of phrases to avoid on campus.Microaggressions are subtle, invisible and insidious remarks that create an “internal conflict” for minorities who experience them, the university says in ersity training manuals, likening the impact to death by a thousand cuts.Scholars are told it is “denigrating cultural valuescommunication styles” to tell an East Asian person to “speak up more” or to tell a black person “why do you have to be so loud? Just calm down”.Campus security guards are told not to ask a black member of staff if they are lost because this carries “assumptions of criminality”.Imperial’s guide adds that uttering the phrase “I’m not racist. I have several black friends” is denying minorities’ experience of bias.Staff should not say “I believe the most qualified person should get the job. We need excellence!” because this perpetuates the “myth of meritocracy” that BAME people are not disadvantaged.Meanwhile, Edinburgh University has told staff and students not to say “your English is really good” to anyone who is black, Asian British, Nigerian or American because this is a “microinsult.This means a subtle snub, conveying insult to the recipient and denying bias.It comes as the Government unveiled new free speech laws in the Queen’s Speech to tackle “rising intolerance” on campuses.In a crackdown on cancel culture, students and academics will be able to sue for compensation through the courts if they feel unfairly silenced.Toby Young, general secretary of the Free Speech Union which has dealt with 100 cases of campus censorship in the past year, said protections from “over-reaching ersitycrats” trying to police speech and thought are urgently needed.“Universities have no business telling their academic staff what they can and can’t praise about their students’ work,” he said.“Surely, the way to create a welcoming environment for BAME students at a university is to assure them they will be treated in exactly the same way as every other student? To hold BAME students to a lower standard than white students is incredibly patronising.“These misguided woke initiatives, which undermine academics’ autonomy and professional integrity, is exactly why we need more protection for free speech on campus.”Imperial’s microaggressions guide and video, produced by the Faculty of Engineering, urges staff to think about how they make others feel in all interactions, and ensure they acknowledge race, age and gender.Edinburgh University, which declined to comment, also urges students in ersity training not to engage in avoidant behaviour around BAME people or say they are being oversensitive if they feel offended, as these are “microinvalidations”.A spokesman for Imperial College London said: “A video on the experiences of BAME colleagues does not ‘threaten free speech’, and we would reject any efforts to shut down these important discussions.” ENDSMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hugging first celebrities politicians reveal first squeeze ahead","story":"Joanna Lumley, actress, I shall be hugging literally everyone I can get my hands on.

And when Sir Keir Starmer used his first speech as Labour leader to apologise and promise to make rooting out anti-Semitism from his party his priority, we listened.But facts have an awkward habit of getting in the way of spin. And the last week has shown that Sir Keir’s fine words are just that: spin. The existential threat Corbyn posed was dependent on his winning power. In Israel, Jews – and Israeli Arabs – are being actually killed by rockets fired by a terrorist organisation, now. And what does Sir Keir have to say about the kind of anti-Semitism that murders Jews? Nothing.On Monday, as Hamas rockets rained down on Israel, he posted a tweet that was positively Corbynesque: “The violence against worshippers during Ramadan at the al-Aqsa mosque was shocking. Israel must respect international law, and must take steps, immediately, to work with Palestinian leaders to de-escalate tensions.” Sir Keir did not consider it relevant to mention that it is those very Palestinian leaders who have been sending a barrage of rockets to Israel with the aim of murdering as many Israelis as possible.Whatever progress Labour has made under Sir Keir in dealing with anti-Semitism in its ranks – and there has been some – was wiped out in that one tweet. The message was unambiguous: dead Jews don’t matter.Not that anyone should be surprised. Corbyn did not emerge out of nowhere. He may have been an obscure figure to most people when he won the Labour leadership in 2015 but he was well known within the party. The members who elected him with 59.5 per cent of the vote knew what he thought about almost every major issue, because he had spent decades droning on about them. And for Labour members, and the Left generally, Israel is a major issue.It is now an idee fixe on the Left that Israel is the cause of most of the world’s ills. In this context, it makes no difference that Sir Keir is plainly neither an anti-Semite nor an extremist – indeed his wife is Jewish. He is leader of a party in which a visceral hatred of Israel is now in its DNA and which has no interest in the murder of Jews.Stephen Pollard is editor of the Jewish ChronicleMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russell group university accused soviet style censorship2","story":"A Russell Group university has been accused of Soviet-style censorship after requiring new humanities courses to “move away” from a “white, Eurocentric” curriculum.Academics at Exeter University’s department of Social Sciences and International Studies (SSIS) have been told that they should “integrate” these changes when updating existing modules or creating new ones.One lecturer said he is “shocked” at the stipulation and claimed the faculty - which oversees a number of disciplines including law, politics, sociology, philosophy, and anthropology - is undermining academic freedom “in the most profound sense”.It is just ridiculous - we are supposed to be a leading Russell Group university. This affects thousands of students and hundreds of academics.”The academic said the movement to “decolonise” the curriculum has swiftly progressed from a “faddish fringe theory” to being “adopted as the new orthodoxy” in universities.“What’s the difference here in the UK, where we are supposed to be a free liberal democracy?” he said.Academics, students or visiting speakers will be able to seek compensation through the courts if they suffer loss from a breach of free speech rules.A document titled “SSIL Accreditation Coversheet”, seen by The , states that all new modules or changes to existing modules must be sent to the SSIS Quality and Standards Team.Academics are asked to “reflect on how you have considered and integrated” various concepts into their module design, such as providing a welcome learning environment, supporting equality and ersity and promoting participation of students.As part of the accreditation process for courses due to begin this September, lecturers must also think about how they are “broadening epistemological and ontological horizons by moving away from a white, Eurocentric curriculum”.The academic said this goes against the university’s own policy on academic freedom and also creates a “chilling effect”.He said: There are lots of people here who feel the same way as I do but no one will come forward because there is a deep culture of fear.”An Exeter University spokesman said: “Guidance from the Quality Assurance Agency asks us to consider the needs of all students - including those studying at different locations, from different culturaleducational backgrounds, with additional learning needs, or with protected characteristics – when we design modules.“We are an international organisation with staff and students from around the world, and from a wide range of backgrounds, and it is right this is recognised in our teaching, curriculum content and assessment.” An Office for Students spokesman said: “Freedom of speech and academic freedom are crucial components of a successful higher education system.

They spoke out amid fears his failure to restrict travel from India in early April has allowed the mutant to take seed. On the eve of restrictions further easing on Monday, Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice warned ministers were not learning lessons – more than a year into the pandemic. The group, which represents , families, blasted: “The Government has once again been indecisive on closing our borders – repeating previous mistakes which cost lives.After the success of the vaccine rollout, fears the Indian iant might mean cases rising substantially are harrowing for bereaved families.” On Friday, the Government admitted the mutant iant could threaten the planned June  end to restrictions. India was put on the travel red list on April  – despite reports of a fast-spreading strain and neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh being added on April . It has been claimed the PM dithered over adding India to the list in April. Some  cases of the iant entered the UK from India before it was added to the hotel quarantine list – requiring a ten-day isolation. Labour ’s Angela Rayner said the delay is looking “more reckless, misguided and dangerous by the hour.” Mr Johnson sought to reassure the public at a briefing on Friday, saying there is “no evidence” current vaccines will not be effective against the new strain. There he was also accused of acting too late – a charge levelled against him at the start of the pandemic, and again in autumn. Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid justice group, called for the Tories to bring forward a public inquiry they intend to kick back to next year. Jo, who lost her father Stuart to Covid, said: “The only way the Government is going to overcome the virus is through learning the right lessons and this is why the statutory inquiry can’t wait.” Health Minister Edward Argar tonight defended adding India to the red list later than Pakistan and Bangladesh. He said Britain has the right border controls “to minimise the risk of not just this iant but other iants in future”. A Government spokesperson said: “We have some of the toughest border measures in the world. We took precautionary action to ban travel from India on rd April, six days before this iant was put under investigation and two weeks before it was labelled as of concern. We have since sped up our vaccination programme and put in enhanced local support to curb transmission. Prior to India being placed on the red list in April anyone coming to the UK had to test negative and quarantine for  days. Vaccine arms race Britain stepped up its vaccine race to beat the Indian Covid iant with the announcement second doses of vaccines will be accelerated for the over-s and the clinically vulnerable across the country. Instead they will be given eight weeks after the first dose instead of the current  weeks. The race to beat the Indian iant comes after it emerged most of the patients hospitalised with the virus in Bolton, which has the highest rates of the Indian iant in the country, are eligible for the jab but have not had it. Huge queues formed outside pop-up jab centres in the Greater Manchester town with anyone eligible to receive a dose urged to do so.  Dr Francis Andrews, medical director at the Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, said: “The increase in admissions is seen across the age range from -. The majority of patients have not received a vaccination dose, but many would have been eligible.” Bolton has been severely hit by the Indian Covid iant, which now makes up the majority of it’s new cases. The area’s infection rate is the highest in the country with  cases per , people as of yesterday. Meanwhile, Scottish National Party health spokesperson Dr Philippa Whitford warned you ‘cannot out-vaccinate the iant’ due to the time taken to build immunity once someone gets the jab. Second doses of vaccines will be accelerated for the over-s and the clinically vulnerable across the country, so they are given eight weeks after the first dose instead of the current  weeks. Meanwhile in East London surge testing to be deployed in Hackney and Shoreditch where there has been an outbreak of the Indian and South African iants.  Everyone over the age of  who lives or works in targeted areas within Shoreditch and Dalston should take a COVID- PCR test. But the spread of the Indian iant isn’t expected to derail the roadmap out of lockdown just yet. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said yesterday: “The crucial road map date for theatres, music venues and sports has always been step . “So I understand this is an anxious time as we assess the situation over the next couple of weeks. “We continue to make good progress with the vaccine rollout and with testing the safeof audiences through the Events Research Programme, but must accept we enter a period of heightened vigilance with the new fast-moving iant. “We will keep engaging with, and updating, organisations to allow everyone to plan their full reopening.”  Today around , fans flocked to Wembley for the FA Cup Final between Cha and Leicester City. It was the biggest crowd at a live event in the UK since the first lockdown last year led to matches being played behind closed doors. The Duke of Cambridge joined , supporters of each team plus local residents, key workers and FA guests for the showpiece which Leicester won -.

Some people suggest he was paid this because of his contacts, so he could exploit his position as ex-Prime Minister to call ministers and beg for favours. But that’s unfair. I think he was offered hundreds of thousands of pounds by Greensill because he was really good at making the tea. I think he did his spreadsheets in very pretty colours and they thought, “He’s worth a couple of million because he cheers us all up”. I think he turned up on time every day and worked hard, so he was rewarded for making an effort. Because that happens in any job. If you work in a petrol garage and do a good job at sweeping the forecourt and keeping the chocolate bars neat, you get called into the office and given half a million shares in Shell.  Or maybe they looked at his CV and thought, “This is exactly the chap we need. In his last job he held a referendum he thought he’d win and lost it, tearing the country in half and handing the nation to his bitter rival from Eton. Let’s put him in charge of everything.” Apparently he sent  messages to ministers begging them for money for Greensill. But when David Cameron was Prime Minister he invented a policy called austerity, to stop people going to the government for handouts. So this was the mistake made by claimants during the years of austerity. Instead of turning up at the DSS to make a claim for sickness benefit with a broken back, they should have told the clerk, “My sickness is I have Entitled Etonian Leech Syndrome. I’m so ill I call people in the Cabinet”. You can understand why Cameron was so angry about people who sponge without making a contribution, because he grafted day and night sending those  messages. And apart from a salary higher than the Prime Minister’s, all he received inwas the use of a private jet to travel to his “third home” in Newquay. And to be fair, when your job is as stressful as sending  text messages, you can’t scrape by with only one holiday home, because sometimes you’ll need to go on two holidays at once. Cameron told the Select Committee he worked for Greensill because “I wanted to put money into small business”. That’s so heartening, that he was thinking of others with barely a thought for himself. The problem, as he told us, is “There is no road-map for former Prime Ministers.” Yes that is the trouble. Unless someone tells you, how can you know it’s cheeky to use your position as disastrous ex-Prime Minister to send  messages to ministers begging for money for a company you own shares in and lets you use its private jet  Some people suggest Cameron’s reputation is tarnished by these revelations. But I don’t think he has to worry. Most of us thought he was an incompetent, arrogant, grubby, talentless, grasping catastrophe before this blew up so, happily, nothing has happened since to spoil his reputation at all.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDavid CameronPoliticsSunday Mirror"},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror indian covid variant","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Indian Covid iant has UK paying price for failure to protect bordersThe Government needs to explain why India was put on the travel red list two weeks after Pakistan and Bangladesh were – despite being the source of the Covid ariantmirrorShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAY Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video johnson-indian-iant-could-pose-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:lXNoLB,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Boris Johnson last night admitted thattransmissions of the strain continue at their current rate, it could prevent the final lting of the lockdown in England on June .

Having raised expectations that le would soonto normal, he is clearly reluctant to slam on the brakes now. Only time will tell whether this is the right course of action.  But the Government needs to explain why India was put on the travel red list two weeks after Pakistan and Bangladesh were – despite being the source of the iant. We are now paying the price for the failure to protect our borders. It’s anti-social What will it take for social media companies to accept their social responsibility  The tech firms have failed to tackle racism, bullying and discrimination online. Now we learn they are allowing people with eating disorders to be bombarded with adverts for diet supplements and weight-loss apps.  The companies claim they remove the advertisements as soon as they are notied. This is the same poor excuse they use when it comes to abusive or racist content. What they refuse to admit is their algorithms are specically designed to maximise profits without regard for social consequences. Given their revenue, they could easily afford to do more to police their s to prevent people being exploited, trolled or abused. They refuse to do so because they care more about money than morals.

I was going to have to work extra nights and days to save up for it and now I can actually get it, I’m so excited!“ One of the reasons Vicky plays People’s Postcode Lottery is because of the support going to good causes.

As the number of cases of the mutant strain continues to rise sharply in the UK, questions around its infectiousness and deadliness have become more pressing. Sir Mark Walport, a member of Sage, said that while vaccines still seemed to be protecting people from severe Covid cases, they appeared less good at stopping transmission of the Indian strain.The deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that the race between the spread of coronavirus and the vaccination rollout was on a kne edge.Prof Harnden said: The vaccines may be less effective against mild disease but we donapost think theyaposre less effective against severe disease.  But in combination with being less effective against mild disease, theyaposre almost certainly less effective against transmission. He added: Thataposs why weaposre imploringto get out there and vaccinate their unvaccinated people. More positive is the fact that hospitalisations in the over-s, who are most at-risk from serious infection but who are also most likely to be vaccinated, remain low. Data also suggests that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines are effective against the iant. Ministers are pushing on with a major easing of restrictions on Monday despite rising coronavirus case numbers.  Boris Johnson is believed to be sticking by plans to allow mixing indoors and greater physical contact in England as scientists warned the strain could be  per cent more transmissible than the Kent iety.Health minister Edward Argar said on Saturday that the Government was acting coolly and calmly in carrying on with step three in the road map to ending lockdown restrictions. However, the British Medical Associationsaid the move is a real worry while many are still awaiting vaccination. Mr Argar was also forced to defend border restrictions, saying it is impossible to completely hermetically seal the nation amid criticism of the delay in adding India to the travel red list.  The Prime Minister warned on Friday the iant could cause serious disruption to plans to ease the lockdown and may delay the planned ending of all legal restrictions on June . The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesconcluded there is a realistic possibility the strain is  per cent more transmissible than the one that emerged in Kent. If the higher transmissibility is confirmed, the experts said moving to step three could lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations that is similar to, or larger than, previous peaks. Mr Argar told BBC Breakfast: All the evidence so far suggests there is no evidence of increased severity of illness or that it evades the vaccine. So, at the moment, on the basis of the evidence we are doing the right thing, coolly, calmly continuing with Monday, but keeping everything under review.  Mondayaposs easing will allow people to socialise indoors in homes, pubs and restaurants, and will permit physical contact between households for the first time in more than a year. Mr Argar said people should take personal responsibility when deciding whether or not to hug loved ones, when allowed to do so. You have to take all the facts into consideration, he said. Itaposs about personal responsibility, itaposs about making the right judgment call. The BMAaposs public health medicine committee co-chairman Dr Richard Jarvis urged the public to take a cautious approach to social and physical contact. With key segments of the population still not vaccinated and clusters of iants, including the rapidly increasing Indian iant, becoming a growing concern, we must approach this next stage of easing lockdown with the utmost caution, he said. It is a real worry that when further measures lt on May , the majority of younger people, who are often highly socially mobile and could therefore be most at risk of a more infectious strain, are not yet vaccinated.

Meanwhile, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has warned the live events industry that the nation is entering a period of heightened vigilance, as plans for the reopening of theatres, music venues and sports stadiums threaten to be derailed by the iant. To combat its spread, people aged over  and the clinically vulnerable will have their second doses of a Covid vaccine accelerated. Surge testing is also under way in several places in England including areas of Bolton, Blackburn, Sefton and London.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeWhen I had my first therapy session  years ago I remember looking around the consulting room for an empty chair. I was suffering from depression which I blamed entirely on overwork, insisting I just needed a good rest and some happy pills But, deep down, I knew my issues were all linked to a dysal childhood in a family scarred by my father’s alcoholism. And I feared the psychotherapist would expect me to make peace with my recently departed Dad by imagining he was sitting in a chair in front of me. She didn’t, and I wasn’t anywhere near ready. In fact it took a further decade and another crisis before I fully understood the legacy of childhood rejection. And my breakthrough moment was one of the most cathartic experiences of my le.  It was so transformative that I wanted to help others struggling with their own childhood baggage and even fancied myself as a bit of an amateur shrink. So when a young relative opened up about his own depression and strained relationship with his mum, I decided I could fix everything by getting them talking. But my cack-handed counselling backfired spectacularly and caused terrible pain to them and the wider family which still reverberates today. Prince Harry felt a similar evangelical zeal after his own “bubble bursting” therapeutic experience, as he explained in a US interview for the aptly-named Armchair Expert podcast. “I suddenly was, like wow, healing other people heals me,” he gushed. And now he’s setting himself up as an expert on dysal families and breaking the cycle of parental pain. While causing the most enormous hurt to Prince Charles and the Queen by accusing them both as failing as parents. Harry isn’t ready, or qualied, to lecture the world on parent-child relations. Because he clearly hasn’t let go of the hurt or fully processed the trauma he experienced. And his decision to step away from the royal firm with Meghan has somehow been reframed as the family rejecting him. Why  would he be highlighting his father’s failings and calling out his grandparents’ deficiencies while insisting he isn’t “blaming anybody”  Especially while the Granny he professes to adore is still mourning the death of his ”beloved” grandfather. I’m sure Harry believes that “sharing his truth” is the only way to move forward. Buthe is ever going to make peace with his father and heal those childhood scars he has to stop the armchair expert act and face him across a room. And neither Harry or Charles seem anywhere near ready for that.

The mum of five answered a newspaper ad from a charity seeking British foster parents to take in child refugees. Clare and husband Andrew agreed to take two. And days later they arrived... accompanied by a further  desperate refugees. The tearful party of  children and four mothers were still shaken up from a seven-hour flight on a single-engined, seatless aircraft from Split, Croatia – followed by a -hour coach journey from Gatwick. It was  and they had fled a civil war which displaced thousands of children.  Many had trekked  miles to escape their homes, walking past a bloodied river laden with the bodies of slaughtered friends and relatives.But in order to be evacuated, charity BP Health Care Foundation needed to register a UK address for the refugees. They put down Clare’s home in Elgin, in northern Scotland. And by the time she agreed, the coachload of refugees was on its way. Now, nearly  years on, Clare has been reunited with some of them, along with former local pupil Petra Lovrekovic.  Petra spoke Serbo-Croat and helped reunite children with parents who had been left behind in Bosnia. The remarkable tale is told in Thursday’s episode of BBC’s Saved by a Stranger, presented by Anita Rani. Clare, now , recalls: “Any wars are horric, but seeing what was happening in Bosnia was absolutely barbaric. “Our youngest, John, was still at home but we had lots of space – this huge, empty house, seven bedrooms. “So when the charity askedwe could house  of the refugees, we thought it was only for the weekend. We didn’t have a proper plan, we just took it bit by bit. When they got off that bus, they had tears in their eyes and they just hugged me.  “The children witnessed the most ghastly things, it was just written on their faces. We had to do everything we could to make it a stable environment for them. And I just remember thinking, ‘Thank God I have taken them in’.” The Balkans conflict, which led to the eventual break-up of the former Yugoslavia, ended in , with , dead and two million displaced. Clare, who now lives in Devon, recalls the early days after the refugees arrived – and quickly dubbed her Mama Clare. She says: “In the first week, I went round the bathrooms and I saw the carpet was quite wet so I called the plumber. He said: ‘There isn’t a leak – it’s more someone’s not aiming properly’! “They were children and, frankly, le is never perfect with children, but you make it as good as you can. “From that moment, they were part of my family.” In the show, Clare meets up with several refugees, including Smail and Nurfeta Saracevic – who married – Adis Delic, and Emina Arovic, who still lives in Elgin. Grateful Emina says: “Clare had this beautul big smile... she was basically a second mum to us.” In order to house  children, the entire community rallied around to help Clare and Andrew – who died five years ago – by donating food, toys, clothes and sleeping bags. The plan was for the children to go to foster homes. Fourteen were assumed to be orphans. But boarding school pupil Petra, then , discovered all of the children had been separated from their families. Over the next four months their parents were tracked down and flown to Elgin, taking the number of refugees now at the Findlays’ country home to . One by one, they were found homes. Most now still live in Scotland or Dewsbury, West Yorks. And the reunion gave Clare yet further proof that her kindness – and the efforts with Petra years ago – were worth it. She adds: “I was overjoyed to see Petra. I knew we were meant to meet again, she completely changed their lives.”Tearful Petra tells Clare: “You were so kind to help those people. The world needs more people like you.”Saved by a Stranger is on BBC at pm on Thursday FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCivil warAdoption"},{"url":null,"title":"inside uks coronavirus hotspot infection","story":"NewsInside UKs coronavirus hotspot where infection rate is  times the national averageBolton has become the UKs worst Covid hotspot with an average of . cases per , people after a surge in cases of the Indian coronavirus iant - more than ten times the national averagemirrorShareCommentsByThomas GeorgeMatthew Dresch:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video huge-queues-outside-bolton-vaccine-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:PzYpINae,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

A temporary vaccination centre has been set up at one of Boltonaposs secondary schools in a bid to tackle the spike in infections, the Manchester Evening News reports.Council workers are also delivering coronavirus tests door-to-door, with plans to hand out up to , kits this weekend. Teams in high-vis vests have been lugging black trolleys filled with kits from one house to the next. It is all part of a huge operation aimed at tackling a surge in Covid- cases in the town.  It is not the first time Bolton has held been the UKaposs worst Covid hotspot. It consistently recorded the highest rate of new cases for several weeks last September - but the pace of the recent spike has taken many here by surprise. It is thought to be driven by the Indianstrain of coronavirus and has predominantly affected areas to the south-west of the town centre. Official data shows that the Lever Edge ward, in Great Lever, currently boasts the highest infection rate in England at just over  cases per , people. A total of  new infections were recorded there in the week up to May  - an increase of  on the previous seven days.  It is no surprise, therefore, that most of the efforts to crackdown on the virus are targeted here. Testing has been stepped up as the council aims to track the spread and ensure those who are infected are isolating. Over the course of this weekend, council teams hope to distribute testing kits to between , and , homes. One of those who has been handed one is Sheikh Shamsi, who lives in Calvert Road. It will be the first time the -year-old security officer has ever been tested for coronavirus. Itaposs good that they are giving these out, he said. We have to be careful.  Mr Shamsi says he has booked in for his first dose of the vaccine later this month, but remains concerned by the rising number of cases in Bolton. Iaposm worried, he said. People donapost seem to care. Some of the people where I work think Covid is not here - like it is a rumour. I have followed the rules all along. Another of those who is worried about the rapid spread of the virus is Samuel Koomson. I donapost know how it is rising, said the -year-old. Any time I go out to the supermarket, everybody is wearing masks and keeping their distance. Mr Koomson tested positive for the virus earlier this year, but says he never developed any symptoms. He has since been invited to have the vaccine, but says he has no intention of doing so. It is not going to benefit me, he said. I am healthy.  If I get the vaccine, I can still get the virus and have to social distance and wear masks. What is the sense  Those leading Boltonaposs vaccination programme have expressed concern that areas with a lower uptake - Great Lever, Rumworth and Deane - are the same places where rates are rising fastest and cases of the Indian iant are being found. Vaccine uptake in other areas of Bolton among over s is above  percent, but drops lower in Deane, Rumworth and Great Lever. Asked why people in those parts of town seemed less inclined to get their jab, Dr Helen Wall, senior responsible officer for the vaccination programme in Bolton, said it was down in part to social factors such as deprivation, as well as the availability of the vaccine. Shirley Taylor, , is one of those who has been fully vaccinated. A nurse at a care home, she is proud of the fact she has worked right throughout the pandemic. It has not been easy, and three of her colleagues have died of the virus. She says she was looking forward to better days, so her frustration over the rising infection rate is clear. Ms Taylor said: “Three weeks ago, we had one of the lowest rates in Bolton. “It’s re around here now.  The highest infection rates in the town are being seen among younger people, with official data showing a huge spike in cases among schoolchildren. The number of positive tests among children under the age of  has tripled in a week, figures released by Public Health England revealed. The data shows that there has so far been no increase in infections among the over s, who are the most vulnerable to serious illness caused by Covid-. However, Ms Taylor fears the virus will start to spread further when restrictions are eased further on Monday. Leaders initially linked the rise in cases in Bolton to international travel, particularly India and Pakistan, but there is now evidence of widespread community transmission, including in schools and workplaces. “There is no way I am going near a pub at the minute, she said. You donapost know who you are sitting next to. I hope they get it under control. I just want le to go back to normal. “I’m worried about another local lockdown. “It’s not our fault. We’ve been abiding by the regulations, going out only when we needed to and wearing masks.  “I wouldn’t let people into my house until I checked their temperature. As part of the efforts to control the infection rates, a mobile testing centre has been set up at Essa Academy in Great Lever. The pop-up site attracted huge queues on Saturday as a total of , Pfizer jabs were made available to people who live, work or study in the BL or BL postcode areas. Younger people cannot turn up and expect to get a Covid- vaccine at the site, despite earlier claims that “anyone” could queue for a jab. A councillor deleted a tweet on Saturday in which he claimed “anyone” with a Bolton postcode and registered with a local GP could visit a vaccine bus and get jabbed. Naveed Deeba, , was one of those queuing up to get vaccinated at the site this weekend. Everybody who can get the vaccine should be coming, he said. I think itaposs the only way out of Covid-.  I have two kids and I canapost really afford to fall sick. My we has already had the jab. I was just not getting my turn through the NHS and I was told you could come here and get it done so here I am. I wouldnapost want to pass it on to my parents, my two kids, my we just went through a pregnancy. I think the risk to them is bad and itaposs betterI get immunised.At a press conference yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to send the Army in to support the mass testing efforts in Bolton.Bolton Councilaposs director of public health, Dr Helen Lowey welcomed the extra support and urged residents to get tested. She said: Itaposs really important that people take the tests, eventhey donapost have any symptoms. We want to stop the spread of the virus and contain it. What we are finding is that it is community transmission. What you tend to find is that the rates within schools or businesses, at the moment it is reflecting that. We know this particular iant is highly transmissible, so we really want to reduce the numbers. If anybody does have symptoms, please isolate and book a test.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"it turns out im really","story":"AdvertorialIt turns out I’m really good at it - man turns health challenges into sport and TV successHow actor Ekow Otoo went from a teenager facing a debilitating condition to a lead role in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV admirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY AdvertorialThanks to CGI, Ekow is transported into the middle of a Viking invasion in The National Lottery adImagine being a ft in, -year-old man and finding two pizzas too heavy to carry, but not knowing why. That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week* “Getting back into sport was the first step in finding my confidence as a wheelchair user. I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline. At one point Ekow is even flung into the air as he travels through a skate park.

She hung up the call but moments later Lawless started the blaze outside his Edinburgh home which left the Polo gutted. Vehicle records showed the car was only registered in September last year. Lawless appeared at the city’s sherf court on Friday and pled guilty to wilfully setting fire to his ex-partner’s car on December  in the Leith area.  Fiscal depute Jenner McLaren said Lawless had an “amicable” Christmas Day with his girlfriend but explained the woman’s ex-boyfriend had sent a text “wishing her a Happy Christmas” which Lawless had seen that night. The prosecutor said the woman woke up at .am on Boxing Day to find Lawless had driven off with her white Polo. Ms McLaren said the woman phoned Lawless and found him to be “very angry and aggressive” and “accusing her of cheating and messaging her ex-partner”. The court heard she then received a FaceTime call from Lawless, but she “panicked and hung up the phone” after Lawless “threatened to set the vehicle on fire”.  A neighbour looking out their window saw Lawless lean into the Polo and a fire starting in its front seat, it was heard. Ms McLaren said: “After a few seconds the car was alight. The neighbour called the fire service.” Firefighters arrived to put out the flames, she added, but the Polo was “completely burnt out”. Lawless handed himself in at a police station on December .

Kamran Ahmed, , has suffered from muscular dystrophy for his entire le. The disease gradually debilitates muscle strength and coordination and has left Kamran unable to look after himself. Despite his condition, Kamran has dedicated his time to rallying support for the disadvantaged and fundraised for people in developing countries during Ramadan. Now his older brother Rizwan is doing the same for him after the emergence of an advanced robotic exoskeleton which allows disabled people to regain mobility.He is so willing to give for others but he wouldnapost fundraise to help himself, Rizwan, , told LancsLive.I always look at him and Iaposm thinking: aposHeaposs wasting awayapos, it breaks my heart, he added.  My younger brother is an inspiration to everyone, heaposs a really caring guy,thereaposs anything he can do, heaposs the first one that will try and help. The Phoenix Medical Exoskeleton was created in America and comes with a £, price tag out of the familyaposs budget. It works as a suit worn over the lower half of the body which electronically controls leg movement. With special modular points around the hips and knees, the Exoskeleton could help Rizwan to walk independently for the first time in  years. Rizwan is admiring of Kamranaposs resilience and his altruism in the face of his own personal struggles. He hopes others will show the same compassion to his sibling. Heaposs had so many falls, said Rizwan. Itaposs a miracle he hasnapost seriously injured himself already.  He has hand rails to help him get out of his chair and once he fell and got his arm trapped, it was two hours before anyone could get to him. If I was like him I would be quite depressed but he just seems to get on with it and not make a big deal out of it. At the same time, heaposs compassionate, heaposs really into his charity work and into helping others, thataposs his escape. Kamran was born with muscular dystrophy but managed tofairly well when he was younger, getting around with just a slight limp. When he was in his twenties it got a lot worse, the doctors told him it would, Rizwan said. Over the past two decades Kamran has slowly lost his ability to walk and has spent much of his time bedbound. Kamran was recently involved in a community project which put together support packages for elderly people during lockdown. He has also helped establish a madrasah , to help needy people in the UK as-well-as working on numerous projects with Preston North End. Rizwan said: If I can get something that helps him even  per cent, it will make a huge dference.Rizwan is trying to raise £, to buy a Phoenix Medical Exoskeleton.

It is hoped the final sections of the economy that remain closed after the easing on Monday, such as nightclubs and large events, couldby summer but this could be scupperedinfections continue to rise.rules.On Friday Boris Johnson said he was anxious about the B.. strain, which almost doubled in a week.But there is good news and bad news - and itaposs important to be aware of the facts. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section . Why are we concerned about the Indian iant Cases of the B... iant have more than doubled in the UK - from  to , - in a week as lockdowns are eased. In minutes released on Friday night, Government scientists say that the iant could be % more infectious than the Kent strain. . How has this happened The original India iant - officially known as B.. - was first detected in October and cases have been imported from abroad.India is currently in the grips of a coronavirus crisis, which is crippling its healthcare system.The country was added to Britainaposs travel aposred listapos two weeks ago but the iant is now known to be spreading in clusters in some communities in the UK.  . Is there more than one Indian iant  Three types of the B.. iant, first detected in India, are circulating within the UK, and it is B... that is spreading fast and causing concern. The B... iant now makes up the majority of our cases and appears to be growing faster than others.  . Will the iant result in more deaths  Experts saythe iant is proven to be % more infectious it could lead to , deaths a day and , daily hospitalisations by the summer. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said that it is aposhighly likely that the strain is more transmissible. He warnedit is proven the UK could see aposa really signicant surgeapos in Covid- cases. Public Health England says so far four people have died after contracting the Indian iant.  . What areas in the UK have been affected the most  London and the North West have reported the highest number of cases of that strain, which the World Health Organisation has classied as a iant of global concern. The capital had  cases as of Wednesday, accounting for almost a third of total Covid cases in the capital. The North West was not far behind, with its total of  infections making up a quarter of all confirmed and probable cases of coronavirus in the region, which includes Greater Manchester.  . Why does it spread easier than previous iants  The Indian iant contains two key mutations to the outer “spike” protein of the virus that attaches to human cells. Some experts believe it may be overpowering prior immunity from natural infections in some people who had caught earlier iants.  . Is the Indian iant immune to vaccines  There is no indication yet that it evades the protection offered by current vaccines. This means evenit becomes more prevalent across the UK it should not make most people seriously ill. Widespread vaccinations and natural immunity mean it should not trigger death spikes seen during earlier waves and put hospitals under pressure again. The Government is looking at ways to “flex” the rollout of vaccines in the worst hit areas such as the North West, including accinating everyone in multi-generational households from -year-olds to grandparents.. Why does it put the June  reopening at risk  Increasing Covid- rates with any iant would still kill some unvaccinated people - take-up is lower in ethnic minority communities - or those for whom immune protection has waned. Higher viral prevalence also increases the chances that the virus will mutate again to stop vaccines working as well. The public must help suppress the Covid- infection rate in the face of the Indian iantthe planned lting of restrictions in June is to stay on track, the vaccines minister has said. Nadhim Zahawi urged people in the  areas of England with spread of the Indian iant of concern to follow local health advice, get tested and isolatethey test positive.  . What can the UK do about it  Make use of our world leading genetic sequencing to detect clusters and deploy surge testing. Surge testing has been launched in  areas, including Bolton, Formby and parts of London, while increased genomic sequencing and enhanced contact tracing are among other measures being used to prevent the spread of the iant, the Government said. The Government is also considering bringing forward the date for a second dose of vaccine for eligible groups to increase protection. The fact that we are hearing about this increase actually shows the system at work. India is now on the travel Red List and restrictions must continue with countries where the iant is prevalent.

According to royal commentator Julie Montagu, the interview left viewers in no doubt that there is a real rt between Prince Charles and Prince Harry. Speaking on Channel ’s Charles and Harry: Father  Son Divided, airing on Saturday night, Ms Montagu said: “The person who was really knocked to the ground in that interview with several punches was Prince Charles  per cent. “The takeaway from that interview was that there is a real rt, there is real distance, there is real anger.”  Relationship psychologist Anjula Mutanda added: “You could see that it was dficult for Harry to speak about his relationship with his family, but at the same time he wanted to. “He wanted to get a message through that he has struggled deeply with what has been going on and there were definite fractures in the relationship. “These are seismic statements to make about one’s own family members, and I wonder from Charles’ point of view he would have felt very exposed by his son.” During the bombshell interview with chat show host Oprah, Harry said he felt really let down by his father, saying: He knows what pain feels like. Of course I will always love him but thereaposs a lot of hurt thataposs happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that. During the interview, which sent shockwaves across the world, former actress Meghan told pal Oprah that being part of The Firm was tough.The Duchess of Sussex made the claims after admitting that becoming a royal was hard after having lived a really independent le before marrying Prince Harry. Meghan told how - what many would think to be a fairytale existence - is not as idyllic as it seems, due to not having the usual freedoms that she had prior to becoming Mrs Mountbatten-Windsor. The interview - which the pair were not paid for taking part in - rocked the world with several allegations.The couple also spoke out about being financially cut off from the Royal Family, racist comments about Archieaposs skin tone, relying on inheritance from Princess Diana to survive, and Prince Harry revealed that his father, Prince Charles, stopped taking his calls.Both the Duke and Duchess admitted that being part of the family left them feeling trapped and silenced. Prince Harry spoke to Dax Shepard on Thursday about his upbringing, saying his father passed on genetic pain and discussing how he wants to break that cycle.  Speaking about his upbringing as a Royal, Prince Harry told Shepard on his aposArmchair Expertapos podcast: When it comes to parenting,Iaposve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, Iaposm going to make sure I break that cycle so that I donapost pass it on.Itaposs a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway, so we as parents should be doing the most we can to try and say aposyou know what, that happened to me, Iaposm going to make sure that doesnapost happen to youapos.

Last week the Duke of Sussex appeared on Dax Shepardaposs Armchair Expert podcast to promote his Apple TV+ series with Oprah Winfrey. He opened up about his childhood, claiming his dad suffered during his upbringing, and then treated me the way he was treated.Harry said that he moved to the US with we Meghan Markle to break the cycle. The -year-old at one point also compared his previous le to The Truman Show, a psychological comedy-drama in which Jim Carreyaposs Truman Burbank discovers his le is a reality show.While many have praised the royal for being candid about his upbringing and emotional wellbeing, others were less sympathetic. Among the was Penny Junor, author of Prince Harry : Brother, Soldier, Son. She said that she was surprised that Duke had taken another wrecking ball to his family this week, blaming his woes on generations of bad parenting, The Times reported.He is now  years old. It is time he stopped blaming others for his situation and started taking responsibility, Ms Junor wrote. Here he is taking another wrecking ball to his family, blaming his woes — the apospain and sufferingapos — on generations of bad parenting.  The author suggested that Harry should save his woes for the therapistaposs sofa rather than for interviews. Ms Junoraposs scathing remarks came after a refreshing spell of honesty from the Duke. On the podcast he discussed his own struggles growing up in the spotlight and said in his early s he would grin and bear it - but knew he didnapost want the role for himself. He said he would think: I donapost want to be here, I donapost want to be doing this, look what it did to my mum.

The retailer has suffered slumping sales in recent years as shoppers moved away from traditional department store models. However, the enforced closure of sites during the pandemic was the final straw, resulting in the company falling into administration within weeks of the virus fully hitting the UK. Are you sad to see Debenhamaposs go  Let us know in the comments below.  The company then started its liquidation process at the start of this year after failing to secure a rescue sale. Debenhams, which employed more than , people before the pandemic, sold its brand and website to online giant Boohoo for £ million in January but confirmed its bricks and mortar business would close for good. It reopened sites from April  after the reopening of essential retail in order to clear stock across its stores. The Debenhams stores in St Davidaposs Shopping Centre in Cardf and The Quadrant Shopping Centre in Swansea were busy with shoppers on Saturday as prices for the remaining stock were slashed and reductions of up to  per cent were on offer, Wales Online reports. But most of the shelves at the iconic high street stores were bare by mid-morning with only one or two floors remaining open to customers at both outlets. Shoppers in Basingstoke, where Debenhams opened for a final time today, came in their droves to hoover up some bargains.  Wendy Gill, from Newbury told the Basingstoke Gazette that she’s “not happy at all” that it’s the last day. “I am gutted, to be honest. It’s clothes I’ll really miss a lot, and I like coming here at Christmas. Ruth Taylor expressed concerns that the eclectic mix the department store offered would be replaced with betting or technology shops. Ruth added: “I am fearful for the future of shopping centres like this. I hope people will continue to support what is left, because otherwise what happens to Festival Place  It becomes a ghost town. Maggie Davis Westhead expressed her sorrow that the once iconic chain was no longer.  RIP Debenhams! she wrote. One of the original department stores, over  years trading, its demise is sad reflection of the state of the British high street. Shops are infinitely more inspiring than shopping through a screen. Boo to BooHoo! Time to get out there before we lose them all  The final stores to close today are: Basildon, Basingstoke, Belfast, Birmingham Bullring, Brighton, Bristol, Bromley, Cardf, Chelmsford, Cheshire Oaks, Colchester, Coventry, Exeter, Hanley, Lakeside, Leeds White Rose, Liverpool, Manchester, Manchester Trafford, Meadowhall, Merry Hill., Newcastle, Newry, Plymouth, Romford, Rushmere, Sheffield and SwanseaFOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnShopping centresChristmas shoppingCoronavirusDebenhams"},{"url":null,"title":"tiktok teen bored lockdown makes","story":"NewsMeet Brit teen making £k a day on TikTok as mimes turn her into global starEXCLUSIVE: Alicia Breuer, , has close to a million social media followers just a year after starting to use the video  - and shes not the one only cashing inmirrorShareCommentsByRoss Kaniuk:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsTeen Alicia Breuer was catapulted to global stardom after lip-synching Katy Perry songs on TikTok \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Clips of her miming to the star’s songs were an instant internet hit.Now, at just , she has , followers, plus another , on Instagram and earns a whopping £, a day.And, to use another Katy hit, that’s plenty of reasons to Smile. A-level student Alicia rakes in the money by promoting fashion and cosmetic brands including Lancome, Urban Outfitters, Boohoo, Benefit, Fenty Beauty and Bershka. She is so successful that plans to study for a psychology degree have been shelved. Alicia only turned to TikTok a year ago while off school and bored during the first lockdown. What do you think of this story  Let us know in the comments.  She said: “It gave me something to do during the pandemic when I wasn’t studying for my A-levels. “If I’m now able to make £, some days, I’m going to focus on my videos – there’s no point going to university.” Alicia posted her first videos on TikTok last June. She was quickly spotted by a leading digital talent manager and the money started to roll in. Alicia is now earning way more than her parents, ­independent financial advisers Frank and Tammy, who are in their s. Tammy, from Milton Keynes, Bucks, said: “I see my job as keeping Alicia grounded a bit. She’s very ­excited by what’s happening, and so are we.”  Alicia also makes “transitions” – videos which involve a blink-of-the-eye outfit change. As well as Katy, she mimes to the likes of Drake, Justin Timberlake, the Sugababes and the Bee Gees. She added: “The majority of my videos are lip syncing to music. “None of them take too long. Even a transition video only takes an hour to make. “I did a music promo for Alexa, where I lay in the plank position on my elbows and feet on the roof of a car, but it was removed because it was deemed dangerousothers tried it. “So I had to film it on the stairs and the kitchen counter.” Alicia admits her success leaves her mum slightly baffled – even though she backs her all the way.  She added: “I wouldn’t say she’s hopeless on social media... she has downloaded my videos and gives them a look. She is still always on my back to do my school work. There’s always time for other things, though. “My form tutor and psychology tutor also know all about what I’m doing and they have been really supportive, too. “My two really close friends have also been really supportive, whereas I’d probably be jealousthe roles were reversed.” But Alicia remains sensible about her new-found wealth. “Right now, I’m just saving,” she said. “I supposeI won the lottery though I would buy a house – in a hot country! “I’ve always wanted to have my own business and to travel, though, so this could become the perfect opportunity. Alicia has received plenty of positive comments for her TikTok videos – and, thankfully, very little trolling. She said: “I’ll get questions about what hair products I use and how I wash my hair. I try to reply, but I can’t answer everyone now.”  Alicia broke into the big time last July after teaming up with Jessica Henig, founder of digital talent agency Unlocked branding. Jessica said influencers are typically paid retainers by companies for posting. As well as showcasing other brands, Alicia could launch her own ranges or invest in firms she promotes. Jessica explained: “Some of our earlier clients now make £, in one day, but that could be a deal for six months of content that is paid on one day. We have signed about  girls. When we approached them they only had about , followers, but they’re now earning high wages and making real careers and a lot are not going to university. We help them build their own businesses, like a fashion or skin care brand. “They build out of TikTok and Instagram and YouTube, but can end up investing in a brand as businesswomen. “It can become a growing circle of success, where someone like Alicia posts about brands and the big brands may then, in turn, post about her on their digital sites. “Alicia also wants her own clothing range, so we will help her create her own website and she could get paid for personal appearances at events.” Fans would love to see her live... though, of course, she could be miming. Man turns love for scoffing takeaways into online success  Youtube star Danny Malin is hungry for success – with millions watching videos of him eating takeaway food. The -year old from Leeds has won an army of fans for his reviews of fast food scoffed from a table put up in the street. One clip of him tucking into a full English outside Grandma’s Kitchen – run from a terraced house in Bolton, Lancs – notched . millon views on the Rate My Takeaway channel. Experts say the hits are worth a tasty £, a month.  Dad-of-six Danny said: “It is good fun. Within the last couple of weeks, everything has just skyrocketed. It is just the uniqueness of it being outside someone’s house and putting my table up in the street. People enjoy the honesty.” Danny was shattered in February when partner Carrie Taylor, , died of a heart attack. But the food lover, who delivers meat, found comfort in heading back out on the road. He added: “Carrie persuaded me to go for it in the first place because she said all I ever talk about is food. “The kids love it. They come home from school and they have had people talking about their dad.” Special effects guru worth £m from YouTube videos but still lives with mum  Creative Brandon Baum is worth £million-plus off the back of special effects videos – like falling into a puddle which turns into money. He also has more than three millions fans on social media. Yet despite his success, he prefers to live at home with his mum and works  hours a day – with a board by his bed to jot down ideas  . He said: “I love home-cooked meals. And my family love being involved, always desperate to pick up a camera or hold a puppet. The financial side has exploded recently. “December was the first time I made six figures in a month. It’s incredible.”  Brandon, , first made YouTube videos aged . He dropped out of a screen arts college at  to work as a runner with a production company. Lockdown made him a star as millions saw his editing app tutorials to create “video magic” on TikTok. He added: “My first was my favourite – banging my fist on the table and making it bounce out my sleeve. It got , views, which blew my mind at the time. “When I started, my ideas were much smaller – like hitting a golf ball into a frying pan and making it turn into an egg. Now I try to one-up myself constantly, doing proper Hollywood CGI.” Earnings come from plugging brands like editing app Videoleap – and he also directs web pranksters Woody and Kleiny. Brandon lives in Bushey, Herts, in a four-bed semi with brother Harrison, , mum Samantha,  and her husband Mark Diamond, . Samantha, who runs a care business, said: “I’ll be on a Zoom call for work and my colleagues can see Brandon running about in the garden!” Brandon is working on  videos and has  ideas ready to go.

In the Queen’s Speech the Government said it would outlaw the “treatment”, which tries to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity. But experts are appalled by the likely delay in a ban and the possible loopholes a new law may leave for the practice to continue.A letter from Boris Johnson to the Evangelical Alliance told church ­leaders “non-coercive” support for gay ­people – including praying over their sexuality – will escape a ban.Crispin Blunt, of Parliament’s group on global LGBT rights, accused the PM of “breaching” the trust of LGBT people. One campaigner said LGBT conversion therapy is ­comparable to torture because it leads to self-loathing and many people subjected to it consider killing themselves. The practice has also been called ineffective, unethical, and potentially ­harmful by professional bodies. We launched our investigation after three advisers quit the Government’s LGBT ­advisory  in March. They were frustrated by a lack of action to ban the practice. There were also claims ministers were ­“ignorant” about gay rights ­issues and had created a “hostile environment” for LGBT people.Have you or someone you know gone been subjected to conversion therapy  If so email webnews@reachplc Our reporter Daniel Harding, who is gay, posed as confused Joe Willis, seeking guidance after being secretly attracted to men all his le. He had a video call with Matthew Grech, co-director of Christian fundamentalist charity Core Issues Trust, which claims to have helped people “overcome same-sex attraction” and, in some cases, “leave homosexuality behind”. Ahead of the Zoom session, Grech told Joe men keen to reduce same-sex attraction “normally have to work on things like being more assertive, being less shy... and receiving male friendships in a healthy way”.During the video call Grech, a contestant in ’s X Factor Malta, said: “I do have friends around me who say, ‘Matthew, I once ­identied as exclusively gay and now I am married and I have children and I completely overcame same-sex attraction’.”Grech quizzed Joe about his childhood, relationships with his dad and male friends and askedthere was “a history of sexual abuse”. He said: “I come from an understanding that is not based on ideology but on science – that nobody is born with same-sex relations. The ­majority of the influence lies in environmental factors. “Our minds form patterns which can be changed to ­create new ways of thinking... so that we can take authority over our thoughts and train ­ourselves in a new way. “Everyone who embarks on this journey will say to you at least that their same-sex attraction has decreased.”  When Joe asked why he is attracted to men, Grech replied: “I honestly think that you didn’t really fit what you ­perceived to be the stereotype in boys your age... I believe a misunderstanding took place that led to confusion. “What that confusion does is it brings manipulation – it manipulates your desires. “And then that ­manipulation causes frustration, causes ­irritation and it violates your relationship with other men.” He said Joe would need to “go back to the root” of his feelings and deal with them but warned it is harder later in le once thoughts have “taken root”. Asked how he could stop fancying men, Grech told Joe “master your body” and said: “We need to manage our ­hunger and thirst for connection in an appropriate way... and then work on seeing ­ourselves as equal to other men.” Grech claimed some people might say Joe was “born that way, blah blah blah,” but said: “We just don’t listen to that stuff because they’re misguided”. When Joe said he wanted marriage and children, Grech told him homosexuality “robs [gay people] of family as God intended family to be” and said there are “a lot of repercussions”. When Joe askedGrech thought he was gay, he replied: “No… what you feel is not who you are… If tomorrow I feel like I’m a woman, does that make me a woman ” He claimed even the label “gay” is damaging as it “teaches people to make their feelings their identity”. Core Issues Trust was still advertising this week. It’s website describes CIT as a “non-profit Christian ministry supporting men and women with homosexual issues who voluntarily seek change in sexual preference and expression” and states: “We’d love to hear from you and support your journey!” In , then Prime Minister Theresa May promised to end conversion therapy but before legislation is brought in there will be a consultation period to consider religious freedoms and how to protect accredited professionals.Campaigners fear further delays will put more LGBT people at risk. Nancy Kelley, head of LGBT charity Stonewall, said: “We don’t need a ­consultation to know all practices that seek to convert, suppress, cure or change us are dangerous, abusive and must be banned. Lesbian, gay, bi, trans, intersex and ace communities have been waiting ­almost three years for the UK Government to follow through on their promise to ban all conversion ­practices, and any delay leaves us at further risk of abuse.” Jayne Ozanne, a founding ­member of the Archbishops’ Council charity, is gay and had a decade of conversion therapy that led to a mental ­breakdown. She said: “Those who continue to practise conversion therapy inflict enormous harm by feeding off an ­inidual’s internalised homophobia and shame. They undermine core family ­relationships by blaming them for a person’s “same-sex attraction”, ­stubbornly refusing to accept that our sexuality is something to be celebrated and true happiness can only be found when we embrace the truth about who we are. The damage to a person’s sense of self and dignity is immense. “It is why it has been called torture, leading to a letime of self-­loathing, which sadly leads many to contemplate suicide.” She is “relieved” the Government plans to ban it but said: “I am deeply concerned that they may leave a legal loophole open for these harmful religious practices to continue. “The Government’s failure to understand how damaging these ­religious practices are, and how young LGBT people of faith are groomed to agree to go through them, was one of the primary reasons I felt I had to resign from the Government’s LGBT advisory .” She is director of the Ozanne Foundation which, in a  survey, found that one in ten of , LGBT respondents had tried to change sexual orientation. Of these, over half had suffered mental health issues and a third attempted suicide. Grech reached the judges’ houses stage of Malta’s X Factor, which was ­criticised for airing a ­pre-audition ­interview in which he claimed people of the same sex can be friends, but “everything  is a sin”. After the Zoom session, Daniel, , said: “It felt like I was venturing into a cult. It’s atrocious and should be stopped immediately. “I felt sad for Matthew, the ­information he shared and believed and for people who approach thinking they will be helped when in fact it will hinder them. I also felt anger at being told my feelings are mistaken.” More than  senior figures from  nations, representing  religions, have signed a ­declaration calling for a global ban on conversion practices. The Royal College of Psychiatrists backs a full legislative ban. A spokesman said the practice has no scientic basis and was shown to be harmful. CIT founder Mike Davidson said it supports those “failed” by mental health services, claiming they “abandoned iniduals in conflict over their sexuality, agreeing to offer gay-affirming therapies only. “Banning therapeutic choice – the real purpose of ‘conversion therapy’ bans – is a violation of the basic human rights of belief and association.” He also said a ban would restrict freedom of speech and reduce or impede ­religious freedoms.aposI was made to feel like an abominationapos Gay Jayne Ozanne spent thousands of pounds and ten years on conversion therapy in her s after being made to feel “deeply ashamed” about her sexuality. Now , she said: “You tell a religious leader you’re suffering from ‘same sex attraction’ they will come along and pray. Praying sounds benign. It is anything but.“ The ex-member of the Government’s LGBT advisory  said: “People you trust will go through every aspect of your le to find any reason to explain why you’re not gay. You start praying more desperately and when you say it’s not working you are told you don’t have enough faith or you’re not praying enough. “I was told I would have to be single and celibate for le. I was made to feel deeply ashamed, like an abomination. “This led me to try and find more extreme healing in the UK and overseas – exorcisms or visiting deliverance ministries - those who feel they have a specic gt in this area. I found myself being sick, I’d be encouraged to cough up demons and look in the mirror and my eyes would pop. “I remember one guy hitting me because they believed the devil was inside of me. You are never charged a fee – it is suggested you give what God is telling you to give. I gave thousands as I thought it was the right thing to do.” Years of therapy took her to a “very dark place”, and in her late s Jayne was hospitalised after suffering a breakdown. In  she came out to family and fell in love with a woman. “It transformed me,” she said. Now, she campaigns to ensure inclusion of all LGBT people of faith, particularly in churches, through the Ozanne Foundation and is part of the Ban Conversion Therapy coalition. aposPeople would yell at me to release my demonsapos One woman told how she hid her sexuality for  years and attempted suicide after undergoing conversion therapy, aged , in Berkshire. Sam, , not her real name, became a Christian in her late teens, and recalls being told that homosexuality is a sin when she said she was gay. She said: “Nobody called it conversion therapy – I was told someone would pray with me. I was told I’m not gay as God would never make people that way. Instead I was probably demon possessed and had childhood trauma that made me think I was gay and I needed to be set free. There was shouting, yelling at demons to release me and I was made to confess my sins, repent and apologise so God could forgive me.” Sam went into denial about her sexuality and even married a man, but her mental health suffered and in  she made an attempt on her le. She feels “huge relief after coming out last year”. “My old church still offers this sort of thing and it makes me angry. Young people processing their sexuality need to be protected. It’s not gay rights verses Christian rights – it’s a human rights issue.”MPs call for fast action Equalities Minister Liz Truss said that the Government has “always been committed” to ending conversion therapy. Ms Truss said: “We want to make sure that people in this country are protected, and these proposals mean nobody will be subjected to coercive and abhorrent conversion therapy. “Alongside this legislation, we will make new funding available to ensure that victims have better access to the support they need.” But Shadow Equalities Secretary Marsha de Cordova dismissed this as “yet another example of words but no action”. She accused the Government of failing to provide “specic legislation”. She added: “Instead of yet another consultation we need to see concrete action to ban these despicable practices. “Delay only causes further harm to LGBT+ people.” Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said: “Almost three years since ministers promised to ban conversion therapy, the Government is still dragging its feet, insisting we need another consultation before legislation in this week’s Queen’s Speech. “What LGBT+ people need is change now.” Stonewall – part of the Ban Conversion Therapy coalition – want a full Bill published now, with a clear timeline for its implementation.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonHuman rightsGayPoliticsSexualitySunday People"},{"url":null,"title":"year one pupils sent home","story":"NewsYear one pupils sent home from school after children caught smoking e-cigaretteThe discovery was made by staff at Brockworth Primary Academy in Gloucestershire on Wednesday, who arranged for medical checks to be carried out on some of the pupilsmirrorShareCommentsByJessica Mercer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe pupils were discovered at Brockworth Primary Academy\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

We are okay, I think we are alright.

Mike, former England rugby pro, said during the traditional Christmas Day Sandringham service that year, the Queen stayed with Zara and Mike for a private service. He told the House of Rugby podcast in : Two years ago, she wasnapost feeling very well and so she didnapost go to church and weaposd obviously been what weaposd been through with our pregnancy that we lost, so we did our own little private one - just as a three.

Ingrid Seward, Editor-in-Chief of Majesty Magazine, told the Sun the Queen enjoys the company of Zara and Mike as they seem more normal than the Cambridges.

While weaposre sure it was just a bit of fun, the Queenaposs granddaughteraposs quiet words about Eugenieaposs royal wedding could have got her into trouble with her more-senior cousin. Harry and Zara and their partners Meghan Markle and Mike Tindall had some of the best seats in the house when Eugenie married Jack Brooksbank in October  at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor.However as Zara took her seat she made a passing comment to Harry which could have caused some upset.She was seen leaning back to say a few words to Harry about his own wedding to Meghan, which had taken place a few months before.According to a lip reader, she told the prince: Itaposs very quiet compared to the screaming at your wedding.  In response, he asked: Mine  Eugenie and Jack picked the same wedding venue as the Sussexes for their special day, but they were very dferent occasions. Despite Harry being more senior than his younger cousin, Eugenie actually had more guests, which Prince Andrew said was because his daughter has so many friends. Both guestlists were filled with celebrity guests, with George and Amal Clooney, Oprah Winfrey and the Beckhams joining the royals for the Sussexesapos big day.  Meanwhile, Ellie Goulding, Cara DeLevigne, Demi Moore, and Naomi Campbell were at Eugenieaposs.Eugenie was reportedly upset at her wedding when Meghan used the occasion to tell members of the family she was pregnant.The couple told the world they were expecting their first child on the eve of their royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, but shared the happy news with close family at the evening reception.

They claim that it left the Duke of Sussex embarrassed, and Princess Eugenie and her mum Sarah Ferguson furious. They write: Meghan put her foot in it when she decided that it would be the ideal moment to announce that she and Harry were expecting their first child.

The close encounter happened off the coast of San Diego in July  when the USS Omaha came face to face with a spherical object as it slowly descended from the sky. It was filmed by crew members on the combat ship and the footage has now been shared by investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell with media outlet Mystery Wire.The clip comes as the US government is next month expected to release a report on UFO sightings after unclassied videos of them were leaked to the New York Times. It was released on the same day a US fighter pilot revealed that his crew had witnessed unidentied objects enter protected airspace hundreds of times between  and . Speaking on  Minutes, former Navy Lieutenant Ryan Graves called the objects a threat to national security but said personnel at the Virginia post eventually grew accustomed to them. The objects have now been seen at multiple posts across the US, according to eyewitness accounts from veterans. Gravesapos F A- fighter squadron spotted the UFOs flying near Virginia Beach almost every dayapos, he said. I am worried, frankly. You know,these were tactical jets from another country that were hanging out up there, it would be a massive issue, Graves told  Minutes.  But because it looks slightly dferent, weaposre not willing to actually look at the problem in the face. Weaposre happy to just ignore the fact that these are out there, watching us every day. Graves is the latest in a series of officials from both government and the military to raise concerns about the UFOs and confirm that their origins remain unknown. Senator Marco Rubio called for a report on the objects by the Pentagonaposs Unidentied Aerial Phenomena Task Forceafter viewing classied briefings about them while heading the Senate Intelligence Committee. In the latest video, unidentied crew members can be heard exclaiming: Wow, it splashed, as the ball disappears underwater. Still images from that video were first released in April. The Pentagon has now confirmed that the footage showing UFOs hovering over navy warships off the coast of Calornia in  were taken by crew members. In a statement, a Pentagon spokesperson told Mystery Wire: I can confirm that the referenced photos and videos were taken by Navy personnel. The UAPTF has included these incidents in their ongoing examinations.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnUS NavyNew York Times CompanyMarco RubioUFOs"},{"url":null,"title":"mum gives birth baby girl","story":"NewsMum gives birth to baby girl in her sleep - my daughter delivered herselfA woman opened up about her unusual birthing story on TikTok in a video that has been viewed , times where she admitted \"It was really scary but it turned out OK\"mirrorShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video woman-says-gave-birth-asleep-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:hoGpBmz,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The sense of panic as you mentally calculate how far away it is and at what speed it could get to you is sadly very real. So spare a thought for one poor woman, who had a very unpleasant encounter in the bathroom. The woman, only known as Lucy, shared a video of how she discovered spotted black wires hanging from her tap. But it wasnapost actually wires - it appeared to be the legs of a spider that was firmly wedged inside the tap, ready to shoot out when the water was turned on.  Her video of the discovery has gone viral, with more than , views, although some pointed out that it could be a plastic spider. In the caption, she wrote: So I saw these things sticking out the bath tap, before zooming in up the spout of the tap. She then turned the taps on, which dislodged the uninvited house guest - and sparked a wave of comments from arachnophobes. The video left many people unnerved, as one joked: I wouldaposve died, while another wrote: That thing was about to take my le out. Others joked that they couldnapost watch for fear something would jump out the tap, and many admitted they didnapost finish the whole video. But one person claimed: Thataposs a toy spider, Iaposm not having it. Lots of people urged the woman to leave, with one commenting: Pack your bag and burn the house down. Another agreed, commenting: Simple solution is to move house.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnViral"},{"url":null,"title":"brits ambushed masked men same","story":"NewsBrits ambushed by masked men on Death Island beach where UK tourists were killedEXCLUSIVE: Backpackers Sam Venning and Carla Bartel said two men in V for Vendetta masks attacked them on Koh Tao island, in Thailand, a year before David Miller and Hannah Witheridge diedmirrorShareByDaniel OMahony:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsCarla and Sam were attacked on the same stretch of beach a year before pair were murdered\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters. Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeTwo travel pals have revealed how they were ambushed on a beach in Thailand – at the same spot where Brits David Miller and Hannah Witheridge were murdered six years ago. Sam Venning and Carla Bartel said two men in V for Vendetta masks attacked them on Koh Tao island a year before David, , and Hannah, , died. They say they offered information to authorities probing David and Hannah’s deaths – but were never interviewed. They have now come forward to offer their help to lawyers for the two migrant workers found guilty of the killing. They are trying to prove conviction is unsafe.  Brit tech firm boss Sam –  at the time – says he was smashed on the head with a rock as he chatted with -year-old Carla on Sairee beach. He said of seeing TV footage after the murder in September : “It was horric, I was right there where their bodies were. “It was where I literally face-planted the sand.”  Koh Tao has since become known as Death Island after gaining a sinister reputation for deaths and disappearances.And justice campaigners have raised doubts over the convictions of the two Burmese men – prompting fears the real killers may still be at large there. Sam, an e-commerce boss who now lives in San Francisco, says he emailed the Thai embassy in London after the killings offering to give a statement but never heard back. And Carla contacted the UK Foreign Commonwealth Office in her native Canada – and received an email from a Bangkok-based officer at the UK National Crime Agency telling her the information would be shared with Thai police. She heard nothing more.  Carla said of the island paradise: “Many tourists go there every year. I feel people need to know what goes on.” At least nine European tourists have died or gone missing on the island in the last decade, including six Brits. In  a British teen reported being drugged, tied up and raped on the same beach. In , Burmese workers Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were sentenced to death for David and Hannah’s murders. But the case was mired in allegations of a cover-up and mishandled forensics. The men claimed they were tortured by the Royal Thai Police into confessing.  Human Rights Watch called the guilty verdicts “profoundly disturbing”. In  the NCA admitted breaking UK law by sharing information with Thai authorities – as Britain opposes capital punishment. Last year the death senten­­ces were overturned by Thai­­land’s king Maha Vajiralongkorn, but the men remain in jail. Sam and Carla’s ordeal emerged after both gave video interviews to Australian lawyer Ian Yarwood, who runs an online group about safety on Koh Tao. Andy Hall, a migrant workers’ rights activist and international affairs advisor to Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo’s legal team, told us: “It’s good this evidence has been brought forward, we can consider whether we can use it as a means to reopen the case.” The National Crime Agency said: “The NCA’s assistance to the Thai authorities in  was provided in good faith in the context of a fast moving investigation into the murders of two British citizens. “We won’t comment on the assistance provided but can confirm all relevant information relating to that investigation was shared with Thai authorities.” The Thai embassy did not respond to requests for comment.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnHuman Rights WatchWai PhyoAndy HallMurderHuman rightsCrime"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/Gjen-Shelley-Hague-Arbroath-FC-comm-trust_38972787-559x372.jpg ","title":"arbroath community worker honoured for efforts during lockdown","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remThe runaway success of Arbroath Football Club#s new community trust during lockdown has earned its chairwoman a top accolade.Shelley Hague has been awarded the John Christison Trophy for her work getting the trust off the ground during the pandemic.The trust only launched late last year but is already playing a major role in the town.It runs a free football academy for local kids and is planning more community health and wellbeing initiatives.Presenting Shelley with the trophy, which is awarded to a #community champion# every year, club chairman Mike Caird said that Shelley had done a remarkable job forming and promoting the club during a dficult time.Mike said: #This year we decided that Shelley was a very deserving winner.#The work she had put into making the trust such an amazing success in only six months is well worthy of the award.#The fact that in such a short time and in such dficult circumstances is testament to the fantastic effort Shelley has put in.#We are delighted to be able to present her with this award, given out by the club in the name of our longest serving chairman, John Christison.#Shelley said: #I#m incredibly proud to be awarded this honour.#We have made brilliant progress in the past six months.#We now have over  local children signed up for  our community football academy, giving them the chance to participate in football and football coaching free of charge.#We are really proud of this achievement in such a short time.

It’s one thing I wanted to add, goals and assists, so I’m pleased.“The second, I saw wee Archie pull to the edge of the box, I rolled it back to him and he did the rest.“I’m delighted for him.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

In the first half we weren’t good enough. We didn’t get close to them, let them play and didn’t look brave enough on the ball or ask them any questions.“The frustration comes from the fact for all their decent play it was two deflections which went in.“We asked for a response, more willing and aggression and the response was there.

I don’t knowthey were ruthless but we need to be better. If we create chances like the ones we did we have to take them. I counted four where I thought they should be goals but it is frustrating that we were - down before we started creating them.Glass is unhappy at his side’s slow start in Glasgow and knows it was pivotal in the team’s loss.He said: “The realisation from the group is that you can’t wait until - down in the second half to play. We looked potentially in it in the second half but coming here and being in it in the second half is not good enough. We have to come here and show that aggression from the start.“If you come to places like this and don’t start properly you are going to get beat.”The defeat brings a disappointing season to a close and Glass’ attention now turns to rebuilding the squad for next season.He knows theof Hearts to the Premiership will only add to the competitiveness of the ision but is focused on making the Dons stronger over the summer.He said: “There’s going to be comings and goings and we’re working on some things to make sure we’re very productive next season.

Not all animals are the same some cats and dogs enjoy noise and excitement, but to others this would be very stressful.Others like peace and quiet ndash but to some, being left quiet and alone is stressful.I think most of us are aware that sudden, unusual noises can frighten pets for example, thunderstorms and fireworks. These are sounds which are strange to your pet and can result in a great deal of stress.In a recent survey carried out by the PDSA,  per cent of owners said their pet was scared of fireworks. The main signs the owners reported were cowering and hiding, trembling and shaking, disinterest in food and barking.Pets left alone either at home or in a cattery or kennel, which are unusual occurrences, can result in severe stress, as the pet feels abandoned by their family.Bringing in a new pet or moving home can also feel terrying for a pet which is used to constancy. Sometimes the dynamics of the pets within a home can change and one or more pet can feel threatened.At Dunedin Vets, at the beginning of lockdown, we saw many problems, especially with cats who were not used to their owners being at home all the time.Cats are notoriously sensitive to change. They may hide their stress but it can manest in other ways.This can include bladder problems and over-grooming and itching.Please contact your vet for adviceyou feel your pet requires some help to overcome their stress-related problems.It is wonderful to be out and about in the spring sunshine, albeit it is a bit chilly at the moment.Remember, there are a few hazards to avoid when walking your dog.Do not throw sticks for them to catch or retrieve. These can cause terrible injuriesthe dog runs onto them and injuries occur in their mouth or, as I have seen, penetrate their skin and damage structures in their necks.Last month, we mentioned the collie dog who was chasing his ball and accidentally swallowed it.Recently, our senior veterinary nurse Nicole saw a young couple rush to the front door of our Tranent surgery, carrying their dog. The owners were obviously very distressed, so Nicole spoke with them and discovered that they were sure Loki, their three-year-old cockapoo, had tried to swallow the bouncy ball toy he had been playing with.Mrs Pamela Masson explained it was a hard rubber ball with rubber spikes on it.Nicole could hear Loki making strange noises when breathing she checked he was able to breathe and called the vet to examine Loki. Gently opening his mouth, they could just glimpse something blue at the back of his mouth.Nicole had previously been involved in dealing with a dog which had choked on a ball. She knew this dog was somehow managing to breathe, unlike the previous one she had dealt with, which was unable to breathe and had been rapidly turning blue.She reassured the owners and admitted Loki for treatment to extract the ball. As choking animals are very distressed, they are likely to panic and bite, although Loki was remaining remarkably calm. The team prepared short-acting intravenous anaesthetic and several pairs of dferent-sized forceps to help extract the ball. Once a catheter was placed in Lokirsquos leg vein, everything had to be performed rapidly as soon as the anaesthetic injection was administered, to prevent the ball falling further into Lokirsquos larynx or dropping into the oesophagus. With Nicole supporting his head and a light being shone into the mouth, the blue spiky ball was seen. Grasping it with forceps, and with some tension and rotation, the vet extracted the offending ball from Lokirsquos throat.The ball had a central hole, or tunnel, running through it. This was the reason Loki was able to breathe, albeit in a laboured, noisy fashion.The ball had lodged with its central tunnel in line with Lokirsquos mouth and larynx. The rubber spikes caused a bit of damage to the soft areas around his larynx, but these would soon heal. Loki recovered quickly from his short-acting anaesthetic and was soon heading home with his parents.It is great to play ball with your dog but make sure youdo play with a ball large enough that your dog cannot swallow or choke.If you are playing with a solid rubber ball, please ensure it does have a central hole right through it.This was undoubtedly the reason why Loki was able to breathe.It also makes it much easier for the vet to remove, as there is something to grab onto. A smooth rubber ball completely stuck in the throat is surprisingly dficult to grasp and remove.I think Loki will be playing with footballs from now on."},{"url":null,"title":"musician-records-sounds-north-berwick-new-album-series-depicting-seven-continents","story":"Ted White, who was brought up on Cromwell Road, where parents Sally and Andrew still live, was approached by music distribution service Platoon to co-ordinate field recordings he had gathered around the world over several years and release them via Apple last month.Each of the seven albums is dedicated to a dferent continent, and the sounds of North Berwickrsquos beaches and harbour feature on the Europe: Earth Sounds album.Ted, , said: ldquoI travel a lot, recording sounds around the world, and Platoon and I collectively came up with the concept of collating my recordings of the past seven years into continents of the world.ldquoI did a bit more travelling to record the bits I didnrsquot have.A former student at Loretto now splitting his time between Liverpool and London, Ted came back to North Berwick to capture the seaside townrsquos night-time atmosphere.He said: ldquoI grew up there so I knew where I could get good sounds without the noise pollution that you get in London.ldquoI recorded lots of midnight sounds on the beaches.

I put a load of microphones and left them there as well.With more than  hoursrsquo worth of sounds, Ted used recordings he had made in erse places, including the Amazon rainforest, Rajasthan in India, and Norway.For those places he was unable to get to, such as Antarctica, Ted recreated the noises he imagined would be heard using his own instruments and accessories. For Antarctica, he recorded harsh winds and tents flapping, ice chunks moving around a bath, and also penguins at the zoo.But he was moved toto North Berwick last year for the Europe album.He said: ldquoItrsquos my interpretation of what I think the world sounds like some people will agree, some people wonrsquot.ldquoItrsquos my musical sound diary, so to speak and for the Europe album there were places that I felt connected to, so I recorded a lot in the Highlands, around Aberfeldy, in the winter, to get those blustery sounds, and a lot around North Berwick because thatrsquos where I grew up and, to be honest, when yoursquore trying to capture sounds itrsquos so dficult to find places which have not a lot of noise pollution, and North Berwick in the night for some reason is not that loud.The Mindfulness Nature albums can be found online at sites including Apple Music and Spoty."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-churches-helping-food-donations-pandemic","story":"Musselburgh Baptist Church opens its foodbank every Thursday morning between am and noon, while St Andrewrsquos High Church members have been helping out East Lothian Foodbank.Ross McNab, assistant pastor at the baptist church, said it was ldquoamazing that the congregation was back together meeting in person since the end of March, adding that the church wanted to extend ldquoa warm welcome to our wider community to come join us.He added: ldquoWe are meeting together every Sunday and currently hold three services at am, .am and noon.

making it an lsquoancillaryrsquo centre which will only be used during major events or as back-up.The move will mean people arrested in East Lothian and Midlothian, who would have been taken into custody in the Midlothian station now face being transported to St Leonardrsquosin Edinburgh for lock-up.A meeting of East Lothianrsquos Police, Fire and Community Safety Scrutiny Committee, was told that the proposals would free up two additional local police officers for the county.However, concerns were raised by councillors about the additional journey time it would take for officers to transport people in custody to the Edinburgh station.Suzie Mertes, from Police Scotlandrsquos Criminal Justice Services ision, said that the number of people being taken into custody in Scotland had halved from , to , in recent timesand changes were being made as part of an annual review.She told the committee that providing custody services at St Leonardrsquos would be better for prisoners who might be vulnerable as more support services were available and would benefit local officers who were currently drafted in to ldquobackfill for custody officers when they were on leave.It was not made clear whether the decision to take custody officers away from Dalkeith would see opening hours of the station reduced or changed.However, Ms Mertes stressed that the custody facilities would not close completely and would be available for major events in the area or times when it was felt they were needed.And she said that current custody staff based at Dalkeith would be given the option to transfer their services to support local policing.She added: ldquoIn terms of Dalkeith, should someone need to be brought in for an interview it will be open.ldquoThis is a flexible model that will allow us to push and pull resources into Dalkeith when needed.Concerns were raised about the additional journey time for officers transporting prisoners to St Leonardrsquos for custody however, Ms Mertes said that the benefits outweighed the disadvantages, pointing out that officers could sometimes find themselves manning empty cells at Dalkeith when they could be spending time on local policing.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, committee convenor, said that the move could prove beneficial to those who found themselves spending a night in the cells as well.And the decision was welcomed by the committee convenor to downgrade Dalkeithrsquos custody centre from a full-time operation to lsquoancillaryrsquo.He said: ldquoThere are some concerns that there is movement towards the centre of

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year. May we never see its likes again."},{"url":null,"title":"pro-union-parties-indyref2-obsession-fuelling-debate","story":"In part, this obsession has led to the SNP being let off the hook for its failures in government as was reflected in this weekendrsquos election results and perpetuated by every media outlet across the country zoning in on constitutional questions.Over the past few weeks, the majority of pro-Union politicians have used every sound clip offered to them to exclaim their anti-independence thoughts rather than explain how they propose to get this country back on its feet and how they could work with the Government to put recovery first.With all eyes focused on the constitution, it has worked in the favour of the SNP who have managed to be elected to Government with a record number of votes, despite their failings over the past  years in charge.The First Minister herself admitted during the campaign that she had taken her ldquoeye off the ball as Scotland racked up the highest drugs death in Europe. But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons. Local businesses desperate to rebuild and get customers in their doors.Economic recovery is what matters to so many, yet we are so embroiled in constitutional questions that we lose sight of the ramications the past year has had for so many businesses and iniduals who have lost their jobs and families living below thepoverty line.There is no denying the fact that there is indeed an appetite to reopen the debate around independence, the recent vote shows an almost   split down the middle, but I do not believe it should be up to the media to frame the discussion.There is a huge job ahead for the next Scottish Government to deliver on a national recovery and all opposition politicians and members of the press must be focused on holding them accountable for the measures they are taking to get the country back on its feet.Letrsquos not do Alex Salmondrsquos job for him by inadvertently holding the SNPrsquos feet to the fire over independence but instead hold their feet to the fire over the nationrsquos recovery from the pandemic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Stuck as they are in perpetual limbo by a government which still refuses to acknowledge their cultural, creative and societal value and status, and which wrongly judges them to be modern-day plague carriers of their age.:Donald MacLeod: Jesus, Mary, Joseph and the wee donkey! I need a holidayRestaurants, pubs, bars and cafes may have been given the green light to open and sell alcohol indoors until the contentious closing time of .pm. But strict physical distancing measures of one metre will apply which, along with other robust restrictions like the rule of no more than six from three households, no standing at the bar, table service, and mask wearing when queuing will undoubtedly restrict sales. It will also mean that for many operators, especially those with no outdoor areas to take up the slack, therersquos no point in opening as they wonrsquot be viable.Its a ludicrous situation made all the more preposterous when you think that the same number of people from the same number of households can meet at a palrsquos house for a proper sesh, a house partyyou like, before going out, and after bells, without having to mask up, sanitise and physically distance.Then there is the strict .pm curfew which, along with the two-hour booking window, has enraged operators. Michelin-starred chef Tom Kitchin says herding people out the door at exactly .pm on the dot, when they would normally still be eating, is yet another blow to the struggling restaurant trade.In support of Kitchin, Dean of Faculty of Advocates Roddy Dunlop QC tweeted: ldquoWhat is the basis for saying the same people canrsquot be with you in a hospitality venue with table service at pm \"As for the two-hour booking slots, many in the trade also believe that this will only encourage binge drinking and pub crawls, so not exactly a positive government measure when it comes to reducing the harm associated with alcohol.If you think all of that is crackers, then pour yourself a large one, because the tourism and hospitality guidance surrounding weddings and funerals defies all known logic and reason.For a family wedding, you can leave the house and arrive at the ceremony together but once inside physical distancing rules apply so in effect you cannot walk your daughter down the aisle. You can celebrate, hug, kiss, sing, dance and be merry in your house but not with your  guests at the actual reception, that is taboo and strict physical distancing rules apply. Same with funerals and wakes, you may be together in the cortege, but at the service you must stand apart and again no hugging or cuddling here or at the wake. I wonderbawling your eyes out is also a criminal offence Finally, unlike England, there is still as yet no lting of the two-metre physical distancing rule for theatres, concert halls, comedy and live music venues. A brutal business crippling restriction which seriously threatens the viability of Scotlandrsquos cultural and creative institutions and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of artists, technicians and industry freelancers.:The only R word I want to hear is recovery not referendumInstead of consistency and clarity, we have caution and confusion.

It looks like the UK announcement means whatever is set up will take a four-nations approach, or at least there will be consultation across governments to see how viable that is.This announcement is welcome but overdue, as groups including the Covid- Bereaved Families For Justice group have been calling for an inquiry since last July.Public inquiries take time to set up and then to gather evidence and report. This process is likely to take years rather than months. Findings will help longer term planning but will not change much,anything, soon.:Covid Glasgow: Spike in the city needs a robust response, says Prof Linda BauldIn the meantime we are beginning to see other review mechanisms be established internationally that are already aiming to learn lessons from recent months. Their findings should help us here in Scotland to try and chart a steady course in the short term and also point to issues that need examined in our own inquiries.The first formal review of the global response to Covid- was published this week. This was a report from the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response . It was convened in September  and made up of  members from dferent countries, co-chaired by Helen Clark, a former prime minister of New Zealand and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia. The  reviewed a range of evidence and spoke to many experts and dferent groups. They reflected on the fact that the pandemic has been the worst health, social and economic crisis in living memory, with  million people infected and over three million deaths up to the end of April , although this is likely an underestimate.What the IPPPR report makes clear is that the pandemic was preventable, and argues that there hasnrsquot been sufficient learning from previous infectious disease epidemics like Ebola and SARS. While experts have mapped out how to plan for, prevent, or at least mitigate the impact of these crises, their recommendations have not been taken seriously enough.The report has a strong focus on the global level but also makes recommendations for countries, how they can contribute internationally, and what they need to do within their own borders. This has implications for Scotland and indeed how any enquiry is conducted here or at UK level.The report is an example of the benefits of conducting an inquiry early, because some of its recommendations need to be implemented now to accelerate recovery and prevent more deaths globally. It also includes longer term recommendations. Immediate priorities are around vaccines.The report recommends that high income countries like the UK that have already secured enough vaccines to protect their own populations should, while still delivering jags into arms domestically, provide low and middle income countries with at least one billion vaccine doses by the autumn of this year, with more to follow in .The mechanism for this is Covax, the Covid- vaccines global access facility which the UK joined in September last year. They also recommend waiving intellectual property rights on vaccinesto allow more countries to manufacture vaccines themselves.:Westminster sketch: Boris Johnson calms down about Scotland and promises Duchy courage from GoveLooking ahead, IPPPR also sets out what needs to change in global health governance. They call for more funding for the World Health Organisation from inidual countries, rather than forcing the WHO to rely on big philanthropic organisations. Plus they ask the United Nations to set up a global threats council to coordinate international and national pandemic preparedness, and call for a new international pandemic financing facility.The  praises some countries for their response to Covid- and roundly criticises others, without naming names. Some countries suffered from poor leadership and slow and insufficient action, downplayed risks and didnrsquot take sufficient account of evidence on whatto do.Looking ahead, they point to some key lessons. The first is the need for strong leadership and coordination ndash a lsquowhole of governmentrsquo response to continue to address Covid-. Investing in preparation now for future crises with access to rapid and accurate data and knowing who is accountable for which actions. Having national plans in place for supplies , diagnostics, medicines and vaccines. Plus, setting aside funds for preparation that can be quickly accessed to deal with outbreaks or future threats. These issues will undoubtedly come up in an inquiry into the pandemic here in Scotland and across the UK.There is a final point from this report that is worth emphasising. It isnrsquot enough for international or national authorities to simply instruct people how to behave when a crisis hits. Itrsquos much more effectivepeople can get involved, be listened to and feel they have a stake in a collective response.As we look ahead to a public inquiry on Covid-, the most important voices will be those of the people of Scotland. Not just the families who have lost loved ones but also those working on the front line, and those affected by the measures taken to address the pandemic. It is their experiences that can help us learn lessons and prevent this from happening again.Linda Bauld is Chair of Public Health at the University of EdinburghOur columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature TRAVEL Shepherd Hut Kent.Ive just spent the night in a shepherds hut on Romney Marsh - a -square-mile stretch of marsh and farmland declared an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, tucked between the Kent Downs and Sussex border on Englands south coast. Alarm set for sunrise, Id planned to head out for an early bike ride, but opening my blinds to a heavy fog, its a slow morning instead.\"The marsh mist,\" Kristina Boulden, who runs Romney Marsh Shepherds Huts with her husband Paul, says knowingly when we chat later. Much of this pancake-flat region sits below sea level, and apparently the dense morning mists frequently roll in. It certainly adds a fun dash of mysteriousness and, with a whole day to myself, Im happy to let nature set the pace. By the time my coffees brewed and jams slopped generously on my toast, my neighbour - a chunky-fleeced Romney ewe - has emerged from the cloud. We breakfast together, me mug-in-hand on my hut steps, her snout-to-ground a few yards away.Besides, you cant staycation in a shepherds hut and not spend a chunk of time just pottering and cranking down a gear. Thats exactly what Kristina and Paul had in mind with Rumwold and Lookerer, the two traditionally designed huts that make up Romney Marsh Shepherds Huts.Theyre fully kitted out with hot water and electric: theres a small kitchen area with a hob, sink and fridge, bathroom, and super-comfy double bed. Theres also a log burner, plus a firepit outside. Its just the right balance of away-from-it-all rustic charm and comfort. Little touches, like the sheeps lanolin toiletries and blankets, come from Romney Marsh Wools, which Kristina set up in .Pauls family has been farming in the area since  . Kristina married into it, and soon developed a passion for reviving British wool. Its a by-product, she tells me, that often goes to waste - but with the growing focus on sustainability and shopping local, shes hoping this will change, and works with UK weavers and local craftspeople to create their range of clothing, accessories, knitting yarns and blankets, available from their on-site shop and online.The shepherds huts came a decade later in , offering visitors the chance to retreat from the hustle and bustle and soak up the peace of the marsh. Im here just as pandemic restrictions have lted enough to allow self-catering travel.Extra measures have been introduced to meet Covid-safe requirements, such as additional cleaning steps and later check-ins, and once youve booked, youll be sent a link to their handy app, which contains everything youll need to know about getting to and accessing the hut, what to bring, whats included , available add-ons and things to do in the area .Many guests drive but Ive come by train from London, opting to head to nearby Folkstone to spend a few hours walking the shore and reading by the sea, before getting a taxi for the half-hour drive to the huts for pm check-in. Its lambing season, and Im greeted by a merry flock of bleaters and leapers as I make my way past their barn to the field.Making yourself at home here is instant and easy I brew some tea and soon drt into full-blown relax mode. Having your own hut is a bit like childhood daydream come true, especially , like me, you love a mini solo adventure . Best of all, you dont need to be an expert map-reader or mega intrepid to explore Romney Marshes alone. The aforementioned app has lots of info, plus theres G for Googlemaps and its all pretty well signposted.About a -minute walk from the huts is a footpath along the Royal Military Canal, which runs for  miles from Seabrook to Clf End near Hastings, built in the early-s during the Napoleonic wars. You could,you wanted, walk the whole thing I head off for an early-evening stroll to work up an appetite. A number of nearby village pubs might be options for dinnerand theres a small foldaway dining table in the hutyoure cooking on the hob or firepit.For me, its a Friday-night treat courtesy of Kentish Home Feasts - a lockdown enterprise launched by local catering company, The Flavour Kitchen - whose gourmet seasonal menus showcase local ingredients . Hors doeuvres plus three courses - broccoli soup with Kentish Blue profiterole, fennel gratin with green beans, hazelnut and blood orange salad, and cheesecake with berries - along with a bottle of local vineyard Heppingtons award-winning Pinot Gris, arrive at my hut. All but one small part of the packaging is recyclable, and all I need to do is heat the soup and tuck in. Its all utterly delicious I light a fire and cosy in for the night.The next morning, the mist fades eventually, revealing brilliant blue skies. Ive got a bike from Channel Bike Hireand cant wait to get going. Heading right out of the farm, I take the first left onto Lower Wall Road and the next right onto Tame Lane - then Im cruising along in more-or-less traffic-free bliss, crop fields either side, golden pampas reeds twinkling in the sun. I make my way through the village of Burmarsh then head on to Martello Tower  at Dymchurch, where I join the sea wall.Romney Marsh has about  miles of coastline and nearly all of its protected by the sea wall, which is perfectly sized for pedestrians and cyclists to share. From here, I cycle all the way to Dungeness , the southernmost point in Kent - and home to the other-worldly fishing village and vast shingle desert beach, with its artfully decaying old boats, smattering of uber-cool shack homes and looming nuclear power station backdrop. Dungeness is also a protected nature reserve, especially important for birdle - and a popular spot for photo shoots. I do feel like Ive just rolled into the semi-abandoned set of a tense but achingly stylish thriller.After a snack on the shore and hot chocolate pitstop, its back on the bike to retrace my route back, looping in some extra lanes once Im back on the marsh. After -odd miles or so, Im back in time to help Kristina feed the lambs at pm - then Ive grand plans to light up the firepit and roast marshmallows, and finish off the wine as the sun goes down.TRAVEL FACTSAbi Jackson was a guest of Romney Marsh Shepherds Huts .

It began on Monday with a plea from reader Andrew Turnbull for Gaelic to be brought back into public le. He added: ldquoWhy should Gaelic speakers have to anglicise their names . I decided to illustrate the point with a picture from our files of a bilingual road sign. As fate would have it, I chose Auchinleck, or Achadh nan Leac. And thatrsquos where the trouble began.On Tuesday, Celia Judge retorted that the widespread use of Gaelic was a politically correct gesture, adding that Auchinleck is ldquoa town in the west of Scotland where Gaelic was not spoken and is as foreign a tongue to the locals as Romanian or Chinese. On Wednesday, we had a slew of responses affirming that Gaelic was once widely spoken in the area, with evidence going back as far as the th century. Doug Maughan wrote: ldquoIf we donrsquot use Gaelic and our dialects, they will die out or become museum pieces.There are areas of reporting where we do use the Gaelic. We wouldnrsquot dream of translating Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is now widely used it is becoming almost as familiar as Western Isles Council. Why not, then, say Na h-Eileanan for the area the local authority represents  After all, we have no qualms when it comes to munros: Aonach Mograver and Buachaille Etive Mograver, for example, may not trip off the tongue, but theyrsquore familiar to many. And The Herald reported last September on the growing campaign to change Fort William to An Gearasdan.That chimes with a theme in Mr Maughanrsquos letter: ldquoWe have no right to disrespect other cultures by disregarding their languages and names, he wrote, giving as an example Mount Everest: should it revert to being Nepali Sagarmatha or Tibetan Chomolungma He actually raises a fair point. There are many place names that we no longer anglicise as a matter of course. I used to harbour an ambition to visit Ayers Rock, now itrsquos Uluru.We donrsquot talk about Bombay any more, itrsquos Mumbai. Beijing, not Peking.But how far should we go  Itrsquos one thing to abandon colonial names that were used because we wanted them to sound British. That is as it should be. But sometimes, for a while at least, new usages cause confusion. For example, Czechia might cause some readers to stumble before realising that we are talking about the Czech Republic .Our style guide is unhelpfully silent on the issue. I can find no advice on changing place names, Gaelic or otherwise. So let us know what you think.

In regards to food supply issues, it could be used as an effective tool to predict what will happen in areas hit by climate change by showing the effects of growing dferent crops and using dferent techniques.As well as improving the resilience of crops, it could also help reduce pesticide use ndash improving the impact on the environment as well as increasing yields. Carbon emissions could also be reduced by accurately modelling how dferent crops could be grown effectively in dferent places so they are harvested nearer local markets, decreasing the need for transport.This digital twin would be a ldquogame-changer according to Jaime Reed, CGIrsquos vice president of space data s and applications in the UK. ldquoPeople have dreamed of modelling these really big, tricky problems for years and now, because of the computing power that is available, we are finally on the verge of being able to do it which is exciting, he said.ldquoWe hear a lot of negative things about companies using data for advertising and so on but we can take a lot of that technology and use it to make tangible dferences to peoplersquos lives.He said CGIrsquos digital twin was intended to be a proof of concept, to see whether it could be done. ldquoItrsquos a really good idea but it is a very big challenge, he said.ldquoNothing like this has ever been done before other than weather forecasting, which has taken  years using computers to get to where we are today. Everybody thinks it is feasible but we need to prove it so this project is really on that cutting edge to show it is possible.CGI will build the precursor using its digital data  technology incorporating Articial Intelligencetechniques. A model integration will bring together multiple data sets, including socio-economic and physical measurements to demonstrate how powerful these advanced technologies can be for solving todayrsquos most pressing challenges.The precursor will be developed by an industrial and scientic team including Oxford University Innovation, Trillium and IIASA. A wide ranging stakeholder group of scientists and users will support the precursor to ensure it is truly state-of-the-art, fit-for-purpose and will build momentum towards ground-breaking digital innovation in Europe.Reed said it took ldquoa lot of hard work to win the project but there is now a first class team working on it, including stakeholders who could provide valuable input on the kind of problems they would like solved.ldquoThe aim is to build something that is useful, so that is why we need to have the stakeholders guiding us, he said. ldquoThere is a strong academic link there as well so it is really about the community coming together to deliver a game changer.CGI has, in fact, been delivering complex, mission-critical space software systems for clients across Europe, Asia and North America supporting satellite navigation, communications and operations, to space enabled applications for over  years.Reed said: ldquoThis builds on all the heritage we have in this area as we have been doing this kind of thing for quite a long time.The prototype will use satellite data that monitors crops and combines it with data on weather, climate and population movement and growth to produce holistic modelling.An example of how it would work would be to provide predictions of what will happen as a result of the UK changing its way of managing crops now that it has left the EU.ldquoThe aim is now to improve bioersity which is a big policy change but nobody really knows what is going to happen because there are no integrated simulation systems at present, Reed said. Modelling of crop production in climate stressed areas would be of interest to aid agencies, the World Bank and the UN, he pointed out.ldquoOne of the problems at the moment is that it is quite hard to evaluate what the solutions are because everything is done quite experimentally, said Reed.The Digital Twin Earth would be able to run through dferent scenarios to see what would work best in order to make more informed decisions on food production.Gordon Campbell at ESA said: lsquolsquoThis is an extremely challenging development activity, linking erse analysis capabilities to provide a step change in the information available to decision makers in domains such as food security, protecting ecosystems and bioersity, planning energy production and managing resource utilisation within the framework of the European Green Deal. The range of competencies within the team is well suited to addressing this challenge and developing a prototype system to enable target stakeholders to explore the opportunities afforded by these new analysis tools.Shaun Stretton, Senior Vice President for UK  Australia Space Control and Information Solutions at CGI added: ldquoWe are excited to be part of the ESA Digital Twin Earth programme which will enable the scientic community to better understand the environmental changes impacting our global food supply. This project builds on our ongoing support to the European Space Agency and Thematic Exploitation Platforms.------------------------------------------------------High hopes of creating a better worldData gathering advances may not only assist with global food shortages but also improve climate change predictionsACCURATE data will be essential to enable the Digital Twin Earth to produce valid and precise modelling of the results of climate change and weather patterns on food production.Much of this data will be gleaned from the satellites that orbit the planet, monitoring its climate and weather.These observations could now be made much more accurate by a new project which also involves CGI.Called TRUTHS, it is a UK-led mission, designed to improve Earth observation data in order to drive improved climate change modelling.It is intended to increase the ability for climate benchmarking and satellite cross-calibration, enabling a metrology laboratory in space as well as providing measurements of the solar spectrum to address scientic questions.It is being led by Airbus in the UK and involves the UK Space Agencyand other ESA member states and will be delivered by the European Space Agencyto enable in-flight calibration of Earth Observationsatellites.If successful, it will help deliver improved confidence in Earth observation data gathered from space and the critical forecasts provided by this data.CGIrsquos role is to define the Payload Data Ground Systemfor the Traceable Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio-Studiessatellite.ldquoAccuracy of data is vital in helping scientists understand the impact of climate change and we are proud to be supporting this mission with our strong heritage of ground segment control and space data exploitation, said Shaun Stretton, Senior Vice President for UK  Australia Space Control and Information Solutions at CGI."},{"url":null,"title":"positive-non-even-dare-say-feeling-bit-cheery","story":"Oh, well, whatever.She is my psychologist ndash yes, all part of the service ndash and shersquod arrived with a Portuguese intern who was brought because he speaks English.

This is an extended version of one of them.Michael Faraday was one of the world’s greatest scientists.He was also one of the first to recognise the importance of reaching a wider audience and he had the perfect venue for this, at the Royal Institution in London. The lecture theatre there is probably the most famous in the world, thanks to the Christmas Lectures he began in , which have been televised since . It was designed by an Orcadian, Thomas Webster.Thomas’s father Alexander was English, but his mother Mary was the daughter of Thomas Baikie, the minister at St Magnus Cathedral, and Thomas grew up in Orkney.According to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he attended Kirkwall Grammar School, and then went to Aberdeen University in , where “he assisted Professor Patrick Copland, a populariser of science.” Professor Copland was a pioneer of public education, whose extramural classes ran from  to . He also pioneered the use of demonstrations in his lectures, so Thomas may have taken a few new ideas with him when he went to London.Thomas Webster enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in London as an architectural student in , and had his own business by . He began “a school for mechanics,” and this came to the attention of Count Rumford, one of the founders of what became the Royal Institution. Rumford’s aim was to encourage the use of mechanical inventions and improvements, and to encourage “the Application of Science to the Common Purposes of Le.”At the age of , Webster was engaged as treasurer and secretary of the Institution and, as Clerk of Works, superintended the transformation of a house into a suitable building. In January , he was told to prepare plans for a new lecture room. Many years later he wrote:The theatre of the Royal Institution is pronounced to be the most perfect room of the kind in the kingdom for possessing the properties of allowing the lecturer to be well heard and seen by the audience and for affording them easy entrance and exit, c . . . it has been stated by Faraday, in his late examination before a committee of the House of Commons, to be ‘almost perfect as a lecture room,’ and that ‘although architects are continually measuring and drawing it to copy from, and many other rooms have been built in imitation of it in which he has tried his voice, yet none of them proved equal to that in question.Sir Humphrey Davy was the first scientist to draw crowds to the lecture theatre, which could seat  people. He also made good use of the laboratory which Thomas Webster had installed, using electrolysis to discover sodium and potassium. Webster wrote later: “The chemical laboratory in which so many valuable discoveries have been made was not only designed and built by me, but owes to me its very existence, for, though I inserted it in my plans, the managers did not at first consider it necessary.”Count Rumford had assured Webster that he was going to establish a science school for workmen and, as he wrote to a friend:It was through the prospect of being employed in this way, which would have been as agreeable to my habits of thinking as useful to my interest, that I was induced to give up the school which I then kept and the other business in which I was engaged, and to accept of a situation and salary in the Institution by no means equivalent to what I should have considered myself as entitled to under other circumstances.Eighty years before compulsory education, he had found that new techniques in building needed better-educated workmen.Knowing from previous experience what it was possible to effect in their improvement, I conceived the idea of giving to mechanics for this purpose a species of scientic education suited to their condition, and I believe I was the first person in this country who took active steps for effecting so desirable an object. I was not unacquainted with the political feelings of that time, but I did not think a little learning was a dangerous thingjudiciously bestowed . . . My idea was to make good mechanics, not to force them like hot-bed plants out of the sphere in which they are so useful.Webster succeeded in convincing the managers that the school was a good idea. News of the school was published, and was very well received. Sadly, after all the preparations were made, ideas changed.I was asked rudely what I meant by instructing the lower classes in science. I was told likewise that it was resolved upon that the plan must be dropped as quietly as possible. It was thought to have a dangerous political tendency, and I was told thatI persisted, I would become a marked man!Webster decided to leave the institution and embark on another career, as a landscape artist.This somehow led to work on textbooks and a commission in , to draw one of the first geological maps of England. Geology was a very new science the Geological Society had only been founded in . Sir Henry Englefield, President of the Society, commissioned Webster to survey and draw the geology of the Isle of Wight. This was published in .Ten years later, Webster became the secretary of the Geological Society and curator of its museum. Soon, he was back at the Royal Institution.Notices of lecture courses in the s include Faraday on chemistry and Webster on geology. He gave the Christmas Lectures, “suitable for a juvenile auditory,” in .University College London was founded in , and Webster became its first professor of geology in .He is described as the first professional geologist, because it was then still seen as a gentleman’s hobby. Unfortunately, this meant that he was poorly paid and, although he was awarded a government pension of £ a year for services to geology, he had to find other sources of income.For the last ten years of his le, he worked on a commission from Longmans Publishing. The enormous  Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy brought together all “the information useful to persons who have to superintend domestic establishments.” It begins with where to build your house, and goes on to cover everything from the dferent options for heat and light to the preparation of every sort of beverage, from gin to coffee.It is now well known that Isabella Beeton stole material shamelessly for her Book of Household Management, published in .Her main source was Webster’s Encyclopedia: on the Arrangement of the Kitchen and General Observations, on beverages, bread, etc. Thomas Webster was unable to complain about her plagiarism.He had died aged  in December . He was a man ahead of his time, so got neither the payment nor recognition that he deserved but his writing, though uncredited, has stood on more bookshelves than all other Orcadian writers put together.Mrs Beeton’s Cookbook sold two million copies in its first decade alone.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents.

This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3800606.jpg--.jpg?1620905531000\n","title":"beth backs foster fortnight with her deeds and words","story":"BALLYMENA Councillor Beth Adger can speak with some authority on the topic of fostering.Having fostered nearly  youngsters over two decades, she was the ideal person to voice Mid and East Antrim Council’s support for Foster Care Fortnight. Foster Care Fortnight runs from  –  May and aims to help and encourage the wider society to understand and value fostering and the positive dference it can make to young people’s lives.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor, Peter Johnston said: “Thousands of new foster families are needed every year to care for children, with the greatest need being for older children, sibling groups and children with additional needs.“Currently, around , children and young people are living in foster care and with less people coming forward to offer homes, there has never been a greater need for foster carers. “You really could make a dference to the lives of vulnerable children and young people.”Councillor Adger MBE shared her personal story at last week’s meeting of full council, putting forward a Notice of Motion on the issue which was unanimously supported by Elected Members.She said afterwards: “Foster carers in Northern Ireland do an incredible job ensuring children are nurtured, loved and protected.“As a foster carer myself for over  years and having fostered  children during this time, I can hand on my heart say it is the most rewarding job.“From newborn to  years of age, the children that entered our home gave us so much love and it really was a pleasure to provide each child with a loving and safe environment during their time of need.“We hope that the increased awareness of Foster Care Fortnight will build support for fostering, challenge stigma surrounding children in foster care and encourage more people to come forward to foster. There is a good support network out there for foster carers to avail of, so you are not alone in this role.”For more information on Adoption or Foster Care please contact HSC Northern Ireland Adoption and Foster Care on T:    or visit W: www.adoptionandfostercare.hscn.net  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3800422.jpg--.jpg?1620900292000\n","title":"brave jessica is an inspiration","story":"JESSICA Philpott’s battle back from le changing surgery would put many an adult to shame!This is the view of proud mum Julie who told the  this week that her -year-old daughter has coped remarkably well.“Every day Julie has pushed on with courage, resilience and sheer determination that would put any adult to shame,” said Julie.It was back on April  that Jessica, who was born with Apert Syndrome, a Craniofacial condition that affects the development of the head and limbs, was operated on for  hours by a team of  highly skilled surgeons, ranging from neurosurgeons to craniofacial surgeons to plastic surgeons, each playing a vital role in the reshaping of Jessicas face and skull.This surgery carries high risks, risks that they were all too aware of due to the fact that surgeons were operating so close to the brain.Julie explained that distraction of Jessica’s face started on Tuesday, May , and the plan is to continue with this twice a day for - weeks.“We are already seeing a massive dference to the structure of Jessicas face and she is loving the change and has shown such grace and dignity throughout the last  weeks, we are immensely proud of her,” said JulieNo chat with Julie or Jessica is complete with a mention of the Slemish College pupil’s beloved Ballymena United!“The love and support for Jessica from everyone at the club over the last few years has been amazing, but in particular over the last few weeks theyve been there willing her on,” outlined Julie.Meanwhile, the surgery that Jessica has just had is actually one of,not the most expensive surgeries in the world!“Great Ormond Street Hospital has fully funded this surgery for Jessica and we cannot thank them enough for what theyve done for Jessica and I during our stay here so far,” said Julie.“Not just the surgeons, nurses and medical team, but also the auxillary staff, domestic staff and catering staff, they all play a vital role and have been a tremendous source of support and encouragement to us as a family. It truly is a wonderful place and there is nowhere  Id rather be at this stage of Jessicas Journey.”Jessica also asked her mum to share pictures of her with her frame on, saying it will give people the chance to see what she looks like now.Mum Julie recalls the day of surgery, describing it a “bit of a blur” for her.“The Team came to the Ward to see me. Professor Dunaway, the lead surgeon, was smiling, they all were. He said they were finished and all went exceptionally well. I sobbed, happy tears, tears of sheer relief that it was over. He went on to say that there had been absolutely no complications. In fact Jessica had sailed through the surgery. She hadnt even needed a blood transfusion which is almost always a given with this type of surgery. The team advised that it would be another two hours before Jessica would be in recovery.”Julie said those last two hours “were definitely the longest of the day.”“Around pm the nurse took me to recovery, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. Jessica bruised, swollen and had wires, tubes and drains everywhere. But there in the middle of it all her little voice said Mummy can I have something to eat,” recalled Julie.Mum explained that over the next seven days they had “good days and not so good days.”“But the staff on the High Dependency Ward were nothing short of amazing. They looked after me as much as they looked after Jessica. They actually made us feel like we were the only family on the ward, They are very special people who go above and beyond every day for families like ours.”Jessica has amazed staff, surgeons and family with her recovery.On Day  Professor Dunaway told Julie in his entire career he has never seen a recovery like it, describing it as “amazing.”“I replied Our God is amazing, it really has been nothing short of a miracle,” said Julie.As the week progressed the Surgical Team gradually informed Julie of what they had done in theatre.They explained that because Jessica was coping so well under the anaesthetic, they decided to do a little bit extra to ensure that Jessica had the best possible outcome from the surgery.“They didnt just fit the frame as planned, they bone grafted her a new nose, they gave her a cheek lt and plated her forehead. So, in light of all of this it made her recovery even more of a miracle,” smiled Julie“It also re-iterated to me that these surgeons are very special people, who go above and beyond on a daily basis for children like Jessica. They want the very best for them and they will do everything in their power to improve their quality of le. Thank you just doesnt go far enough, we will be eternally grateful to that Team.”Husband Lawrie was able to join Jessica and Julie for the weekend - “to help us with the move”, quipped Julie.“We’ve managed to accumulate quite a bit of ‘stuff’ over the last seven days, but it was horrible having to say goodbye.”Julie reports that Jessica has started to eat and drink more orally so not requiring as many tube feeds, swelling is going down gradually and continuing to improve daily!Regarding her frame, the screws will be turned twice a day for the next few weeks, gradually changing the shape of Jessica’s face.Mum Julie is always very mindful to thank all those who have sent texts, cards gts and prayed for them.“It has been absolutely amazing and were so thankful to have the first week done with no major complications. As someone said to me ‘first week done , a road never to be traveled again’.“It was tough, there were tears . There were good days, there were not so good days but we’ve done it and know that God was with us and will continue to be with us in the days and weeks ahead,” said Julie.And Julie makes no secret of the fact that faith has got her through this very challenging time.“Obviously our faith has been a major factor in how we, as a family, have been able to cope with all of this. And the outpouring of prayer, practical and emotional support from our own church, Ballyloughan Presbyterian, Connor Presbyterian where Jessica attends GB and Youth Club and Woodlands Presbyterian in Carrick who have adopted us, along with many other churches and iniduals from every denomination has been special. And we would like to thank everyone whos been praying and offering practical support, it has meant so much to us and it has been wonderful to see so many people being the church.”Julie said they had every faith in the Surgical Team, and “and more importantly we knew that Jessica and that team were covered in prayer leading up to and for the duration of the surgery. Churches of all denominations, iniduals and groups of people from all faiths had prayer rotas going throughout the day, and so we had a peace about this surgery from the outset.”Indeed, a verse of scripture that was very poignant in the week leading up to this surgery was Isaiah : -  So do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for I am your God, I will strengthen you and help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.“This verse was in my head as I walked out of the anaesthetic room that morning, it was the most dficult thing I have ever had to do. But I knew that God was in complete control and would carry Jessica, the team and me through that day and in the days to come,”said Julie.The Jessicas Journey Facebook and Instagram pages have been a real source of encouragement to them as a family over the last couple of weeks.“We currently have .K followers and so I think we have achieved our aim of raising awareness of Craniofacial conditions. The comments, well wishes, prayers and support of thousands of people on the page have carried us through the dark days - thank you to each and every person whos taken the time to comment or message, you really have made a dference and you have restored our faith in humanity,” concluded Julie.

With permanent secretaries often raising concerns about value for money and the inability to properly mitigate the risks associated with potential misuse of public funds, review and evaluation of the schemes approved under ministerial direction will be important in the time ahead, he said.We should however also recognise that the original aims to get help to those in need was laudable and hindsight is a wonderful thing. An immense effort was put in by civil servants to deliver the support needed with some working long hours, seven days a weeks for which I remain truly grateful.We may all judge things dferently in the cold light of day when the immense pressure to turn around support has dissipated but reviewing lessons learnt will be crucial alongside why schemes where estimated to cost much more than what was paid out with strict eligibility criteria and application processes often deterring precisely those the initiatives were designed to assist.The Department of Financesaid: “When an inidual minister confirms a direction to their accounting officer, either the DoF minister’s approval is sought or a decision is reached at the Executive to agree to the course of action.The accounting officer will then noty the Comptroller and Auditor General who will in turn alert the Public Accounts Committee.“The issuing of ministerial directions has enabled much needed financial assistance to be delivered to support the health service, help businesses, safeguard jobs and protect the most vulnerable in society.”With unprecedented levels of Government spending due to the pandemic, many have predicted a severe economic downturn — and even a recession — in the near future, when some funds need to be repaid.Last month, the Executive agreed funding for a £m plan to help the economy recover from the impact of the Covid- pandemic.Finance Minister Conor Murphy, however, warned that, when one-off Covid funding is excluded, most departments will see their core budget fall in real terms.Choices will have to be made, public services will have to be prioritised,” he said.Covid has presented massive challenges but the vaccination programme has been hugely successful and we hope we can soon move towards economic recovery.Earlier this month the Belfastreported the potential need to top-slice departmental budgets by more than £.bn over the next two decades to fund the pension scheme for those injured during the Troubles,the Treasury does not foot the bill.

Photo: Press EyeEimear McGovernTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailDUP MP Ian Paisley Jr has accused the BBC of “lambasting” the incoming leader of the DUP Edwin Poots over his religious beliefs in a tense exchange on the Newsnight programme.The North Antrim MP said the broadcaster had “taken the mickey out of” Edwin Poots after the selection of the Minister for Agriculture to replace Arlene Foster as leader of the DUP - but a spokesperson for the BBC denied this had been the case.“The BBC want to lambast the man because he happens to be a man of faith and they want to take the mickey out of his religion, you wouldn’t do thathe was a Muslim. You should be ashamed of yourselves and the BBC should be ashamed of yourselves for starting from that position,” he said. Read MoreEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlySuzanne Breen:OpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last long Mr Poots, a Free Presbyterian, is “entitled to be the leader and he’s entitled to have his faith”, said Mr Paisley.“He has never been in a position where he would try and force his faith down your throat or anyone ’s throat and he would not allow those things get in the way of how he engages in policy and policy-making.”A spokesperson from the BBC said on Saturday: “At no point did anyone on the programme mock religious beliefs.”Mr Paisley said as DUP leader, Mr Poots interest is “making Northern Ireland work”.“He has an excellent track record of working with Sinn Fein [and] other people across the board to make this place a better place.”Mr Poots will be an “authentic voice” for a community which currently feels “you’re not allowed to have an opinion that might offend someone in some other quarter, that opinion can now be voiced”, Mr Paisley added.“I’m reminded of the Frank Skinner line, you can be anything in Britain today except a Christian.”After Arlene Foster was recently overthrown by the party, Mr Pootswas named her successor on Friday after a successful leadership campaign in which his only rival was MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.Mr Paisley, a supporter of Mr Poots, said his leadership of the party will be focused on several key issues, one of which is the Northern Ireland Protocol which he pledged to “fight”. Mr Paisley said on Friday night the protocol could be “fixed”.“The protocol with regards to business in Northern ireland is destroying business, whether you’re a Catholic businessman, a Protestant businessman a businessman or woman from any other tradition, it’s destroying business, lets try and fix it,” he said.A meeting has taken place with the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis to address the issue, he added. “Every single unionist in this country is opposed to it, it is not sustainable.“Within Article  there’s a lawful way of changing it, [it] allows us to ensure those elements that affect the society, the economy, which create destabilisation, those elements can be fixed and changed.

She was co-opted back as MLA for Foyle in March . Ms Mullan replaced Ms McCallion as a Foyle MLA in June .Gone too are a number of key figures who were at the helm of the party in Derry for decades.Sinn Fein have said this “review” is so they can rebuild the party after two disastrous elections — the  Foyle loss followed a poor showing in the council elections in Derry earlier that year.But people close to the party in the city say that change was long overdue and the reasons for the review were more complicated than simply whose name might be on the ballot paper.The Belfastspoke to a range of well placed sources close to the party in Derry. Most did not want to be named but all concurred with the outcome of the review and the need for it.One source said: “Bad election results can be down to bad messages or bad mechanics but this is deeper than that.“There have been major issues within the party for a number of years and I don’t believe they centre around elections. The governance of the party has been a big issue, there were a series of really bad decisions.”They added: “These issues have been allowed to grow and fester and I am glad the national leadership have reacted in the way they have.”A second source added: “It is clear that the status of the party in Derry has plummeted in recent years and that is seen by the turnout at local government and Westminster elections in .“I don’t think the party had much of a choice other than to investigate why its political fortunes have been damaged.“I do know what they found was not a pretty picture and it was decided that the current party structure and personnel in the city were not suited to a period of revitalisation and rebuilding, including the two co-opted political representatives in Stormont.”While results suggested the performance and perception of the two elected representatives seemed less than inspiring to the electorate, it was the less public faces around the table that rankled voters.Our source explained: “How the party has been organised and what rules it abided by has been open to speculation and ridicule for many years.”They said selection issue have played a part in the decrease of the solid working class vote the party has traditionally got in places like Creggan. Bogside, Shantallow, Ballymagroarty and the Waterside.The source added: “The votes in all of those areas were dramatically down. Losing five seats in the  local government elections was a big, big deal.”Sinn Fein’s power was never stronger in Derry than it was in  — the year Martin McGuinness passed away — but had he still been alive, those close to the party think the outcome of this review would have been the same.“I think Martin would have been a bit more diplomatic in his approach, particularly towards Martina,” one source observed.“People use their own style of party management but at the end of the day, the choices were still stark and the conclusions that the party has come to were inescapable.“It has all crystallised because of the election results and the Elisha McCallion debacle is seen as the final nail in the coffin.”Ms McCallion’s election as MP for Foyle in  was undoubtedly a pivotal moment for Sinn Fein in Derry and came two years after Derry City Council merged with Strabane District Council and Sinn Fein became the majority party.Seen by some as one of the party’s bright new names, just days after her election as MP, Ms McCallion posted pictures of the hotel room in Westminster borough, complaining about how small it was. It didn’t sit well with many grassroots Sinn Fein voters, and that it came a day after  people lost their lives in the nearby Grenfell fire that left hundreds of other homeless was even worse.Her crass comment did little to endear her to the electorate.Nor did a quip she made during the  election campaign to people living in a socially deprived area of Derry, where she would have expected votes, about how they could open their doors because she “was not the debt collector”.This cost Ms McCallion her Westminster seat but lessons were not learned and just weeks after her election to the Seanad in , it emerged she failed toimmediately a Covid payment of £, mistakenly paid into her account.In politics, perception matters and this could be the reason the national leadership of Sinn Fein concluded that Martina Anderson needed to leave the stage.Ms Anderson is perceived by nationalists as someone still stuck in the past but a lot of republicans viewed her dancing antics at a Hunger Strike commemoration held in Strabane in  as “highly disrespectful to those who gave up their lives”.Without a doubt, the way Ms Anderson has been shoved aside will rankle with some — the anger contained within the lines of her family’s statement at how she was treated will not have been confined to her relatives.But a source said the writing for Martina Anderson and her Stormont colleague was on the wall, adding: “I think republicans will have a natural sympathy and affinity with Martina because of who she is and what she had done in her le — between her IRA and prison record and then going to represent the party in Europe.“To be frank, Karen Mullan will get none of that, despite being in Stormont four years, she is relatively unknown, not tested and on the grapevine, she is deemed unelectable.“That is why they are being asked to go. It is not any personal gripe. Karen Mullan is deemed by the party to be unelectable and Martina is past her best and that has been evident in Derry for quite a few years.”The next Assembly election will most likely take place in May , giving Sinn Fein just  months to turn its fortunes around.Can it be done  There are those close to the party who think so.“The task now is about building up confidence of people both within the city and within the party in terms of leadership. It is about reassuring people that they can have their say and that it won’t be dismissed or undermined,” another source close to the party said.“Part of that will come down to the leadership — the type of people who will be in charge, they will need to be trusted and liked and valued as republicans as well. The message being sent out is that it is rebuild, refocus but whether it can be delivered in  months remains to be seen.“Ideally this should have been done two years ago and  months seems to be quite a high expectation but that doesn’t mean you don’t attempt to do it.”Key figures within republicanism in Derry unconnected with Sinn Fein think this sweep has come too late for the party but will create opportunities for the smaller parties and independents.One said: “It will be dficult for Sinn Fein to find a suitable candidate that people will get behind and vote for in time for the next Assembly election but people in Derry are fed up with them.“You only have to look at the last local election to see that — Gary Donnelly topped the poll in Foyle and other independents did really well. People Before Profit won two seats, Alliance won a seat.“I think an independent would do really well in an Assembly election, the only thing is, I don’t think there’s any that have the inclination or the money pot Sinn Fein has to run against them.”Ms Mullan has not commented publicly since it emerged she would stand down.In a video message posted online, Ms Anderson described the review’s recommendation as a “body blow” and acknowledged it had been a “dficult time” for her and Ms Mullan.She emphasised that she had been contacted by “comrades, friends and supporters from across Derry and beyond offering their solidarity and support” and said the “majority” had “urged me to stay on”.In a Facebook post, Ms Anderson’s sister, Sharon Burke, said the family believed she had been “sacriced” by the party.She said the party review in Londonderry “resulted in a massive miscarriage of justice” and the way it was done was “brutal”.The party “came into Derry to fix problems and left creating more,” she said.Earlier this week, Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O’Neill defended the party’s decisions.“We believe the change we’re going to bring forward will hopefully command the confidence of the people of Foyle,” Ms O’Neill said on Wednesday.She added: “Both Martina and Karen will be part of that change, but there’s work to do in terms of building confidence.”Ms O’Neill described Ms Anderson as a “first class republican” and that she had worked with the party’s review group to shape its recommendations..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlyIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leSuzanne BreenOpinion‘Peasants’ Revolt’ as DUP big beasts defeated  Suzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCelebrations on the Shankill Road as Rangers win their th Scottish Premiership title.PlayEdwin Poots is elected DUP leaderLatest Northern IrelandBlack and Northern Irish: The experiences - good and bad - and achievements of black and mixed race people who call this place homeLegal changes will ‘traumatise’ asylum-seeking children in NISuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesBeattie will have my full supporthe becomes UUP leader, insists ButlerLatestFA Cup final: Brendan Rodgers and Jonny Evans help Leicester City to historic victory over ChaCarrick Rangers manager Niall Currie keeping quiet on reasons for sudden resignation Seven Irish League permutations: How can Linfield or Coleraine win the league and what do we know about the race for Europe Rangers title success #right up there# with Liverpool#s Champions League win for manager Steven GerrardJonny Evans fit to start FA Cup final for Leicester City as Northern Ireland defender bids to end -year wait,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She is commonly described as outgoing, ordinary and sociable by Assembly colleagues.She is certainly the DUP’s most liberal representative on social issues. When asked about same-sex marriage by this newspaper in , she predicted that it would be legalised in the next decade due to “changing attitudes”.She voiced her disapproval of Gregory Campbell’s ‘curry my yoghurt’ mockery of the Irish language in . Neither was she impressed when Sammy Wilson refused to wear a red ribbon in solidarity with those living with HIV AIDS.“I#m a member of the DUP who has worked and formed really good friendships with people of dferent religions and sexual orientations,” she said.“I know those people for who they are and that has given me a broader outlook. I can see how some of the decisions we make affect people. I see faces when I make decisions.” Although she believes in God, she is not a practising Christian.Bradley grew up in Mossley in Newtownabbey. Her mum was a social worker, her dad was a driver, and her brother Daniel is a hairdresser. She had a big extended family and summers were spent in her grandparents’ caravan in Ballyhalbert.She has two adult children, Josh and Jess, with ex-husband Robert Bradley. They were orced at . “It wasn’t amicable and we’re not in touch,” she candidly admitted in a wide ranging Belfastinterview in .“We were too young. I was  when I got married. If one of my children had come home at  and told me they were getting married, I#d have said #No way#.”As a young mother, she got into debt, facing the repossession of her home after she separated from her husband. “He went back to England and I was left with a mortgage and two children. Financially, it was really, really hard,” she said.“They were coming the following day to evict me, then I told my parents. They went to the mortgage company, took out a loan and paid what I owed. The arrears had crept up, but I#d buried my head in the sand. I ignored the problem because I didn#t want to be seen as a failure as a mother.“It was a traumatic period. I had two children, aged seven and five, who needed me and I was the one who was supposed to look after and protect them.”On leaving school, she had worked in a canteen kitchen before joining the RUC as a part-time reserve when she was . Bradley was one of the few women in the force at the time. She says it was “an interesting job, but not the career I wanted.”She secured a communications job in DUP headquarters in . After that, she worked as a social care assistant for the Northern Trust from -, but she remained politically active.She was elected onto Newtownabbey Council in  and became mayor in . Nigel Dodds asked her to run for Stormont in . Her son told her to “wise up” but she talked him round, and she was elected.Bradley told this reporter last year that she had never experienced sexism at Stormont, and that her previous jobs in the police and health service had been much more challenging in that regard.But she said social media abuse was widespread: “You#re called horrendous names. I#m not just a politician, I#m a mummy and a granny.“I#ve been told #You should have been aborted at birth# and #I hope your children die#. My kids read this stuff. When I put out a statement online, I#m fearful of what will come.Yes she said there was a spirit of sisterhood in Stormont: “Women from other parties will ring each other and support each other when something horrible happens.”She has said she is frequently mistaken for Alliance MLA, Paula Bradshaw: “We both receive each other#s mail and emails. I quite like the idea because she#s younger and much slimmer than I am.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlyIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leSuzanne BreenOpinion‘Peasants’ Revolt’ as DUP big beasts defeated  Suzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCelebrations on the Shankill Road as Rangers win their th Scottish Premiership title.PlayEdwin Poots is elected DUP leaderLatest Northern IrelandBlack and Northern Irish: The experiences - good and bad - and achievements of black and mixed race people who call this place homeLegal changes will ‘traumatise’ asylum-seeking children in NISuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesBeattie will have my full supporthe becomes UUP leader, insists ButlerLatestFA Cup final: Brendan Rodgers and Jonny Evans help Leicester City to historic victory over ChaCarrick Rangers manager Niall Currie keeping quiet on reasons for sudden resignation Seven Irish League permutations: How can Linfield or Coleraine win the league and what do we know about the race for Europe Rangers title success #right up there# with Liverpool#s Champions League win for manager Steven GerrardJonny Evans fit to start FA Cup final for Leicester City as Northern Ireland defender bids to end -year wait,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She got orced from her husband of  years, William Hull, saw the couple’s two children Fi and Euan fly the nest, got herself a new partner and of course made a ‘poacher turned gamekeeper’ switch from reporting to public relations.It is fair to say that, workwise, the last year has been the most challenging.“I’m good in a crisis and Covid- really was a crisis it still is,” she said.“We had so many messages to put out. Close the hospitals to visitors, stay m apart, wear face coverings... every time something happened, we had to change the signage around the hospital and the messages on social media and where. It was mad, but I had a brilliant team.”She added: “I’ve been so inspired by the people who work in this Trust.“The other day, for instance, I overheard one nurse asking the othershe was coming for lunch and the other replied ‘No, a patient in my ward is so worried about his dog I’ve been going up every day at lunchtime to walk it’.“Here was someone on a -hour sht giving up her only meal for a wee man who she knows won’t get well while he’s fretting about his dog.”Jeanie appeared to change careers effortlessly in  after  years in UTV, but now admits it was “a huge transition”.“Leaving was like missing an arm or a leg,” she said.“UTV really was a family. I almost grieved for that family when I left.”Departure from the broadcaster was, however, inevitable.“There really didn’t seem to be a place left for me,” she recalled.“UTV Le, the programme I edited, was axed [it has since been brought back] and my actual job role as features editor was also axed.“Television was a wonderful world to work in but I’ve really enjoyed my time at the Trust. The health service is full of inspirational people.”She is proud of her Trust being the first locally to embrace social media, which was in its infancy when she started.“It was a bit of an uphill struggle at the start because people still think it’s a bad thing but for us it has become an important medium, especially during the pandemic,” she said.“The mainstream media are only interested in the big stories but we’ve been able to showcase all the other important things that go on in the Trust as well. I’m looking forward to going, but also sorry to leave.”Jeanie , who is being succeeded at the Trust by another ex-UTV reporter, Jane Loughrey, can now spend more quality time with partner Gary Mawhinney , a retired sound engineer and former UTV colleague.“It turned out that we’d known each other most of our lives but we only realised recently that we were very good as a couple,” she said.“To be honest, I didn’t expect to meet anybody . I didn’t want to for a lot of years. But we’re happy and looking forward to a whole new world.”Another thing Jeanie will be able to find more time for now is hill-walking and, her most recent pursuit, running. She added: “Probably the one thing I’m most proud of in my le is I took up fitness quite late, in my s, and I’ve now ran  half marathons. I’m very proud of that.”With regard to close family, daughter Fiis a ‘hula-hoopist’.“Strangely, it is a career,” said Jeanie.“She does festivals and council events, all sorts. She#s also done things for people with mental ill-health.Euanworks in IT and is currently seeking a new job in that profession.In between those siblings, for a tragically short period of time, was Conor, who would have turned  later this year.“Losing him was really awful but the very wonderful thing about it was the way I was looked after, funnily enough in the Ulster Hospital,” she said.“In those days there were no bereavement policies or protocols or pathways to follow but the midwives were just instinctively so good to me that it carried me through the whole thing, and also family and friends.“I visit his grave in Greyabbey every year on his birthday, October ”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlyIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leSuzanne BreenOpinion‘Peasants’ Revolt’ as DUP big beasts defeated  Suzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in NewtownabbeyPlayEdwin Poots is elected DUP leader\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCelebrations on the Shankill Road as Rangers win their th Scottish Premiership title.Latest Northern IrelandBlack and Northern Irish: The experiences - good and bad - and achievements of black and mixed race people who call this place homeLegal changes will ‘traumatise’ asylum-seeking children in NISuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesBeattie will have my full supporthe becomes UUP leader, insists ButlerLatestFA Cup final: Brendan Rodgers and Jonny Evans help Leicester City to historic victory over ChaCarrick Rangers manager Niall Currie keeping quiet on reasons for sudden resignation Seven Irish League permutations: How can Linfield or Coleraine win the league and what do we know about the race for Europe Rangers title success #right up there# with Liverpool#s Champions League win for manager Steven GerrardJonny Evans fit to start FA Cup final for Leicester City as Northern Ireland defender bids to end -year wait,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The historic parallels between the challenges facing the DUP leader designate and the forefather of unionism, Carson, who campaigned to stop Home Rule, are almost too obvious to draw attention to.And the media and the public will demand answers to them sooner than later.For now, though, Mr Poots can enjoy the buzz around his appointment.As he was ferried off, a family looked on bemused, with a child asking: “Will this be on TV ” The answer was yes. As unionism faces the crossroads, it is also one for the history books..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlyIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leSuzanne BreenOpinion‘Peasants’ Revolt’ as DUP big beasts defeated  Suzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in NewtownabbeyPlayEdwin Poots is elected DUP leader\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCelebrations on the Shankill Road as Rangers win their th Scottish Premiership title.Latest PoliticsSuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesBeattie will have my full supporthe becomes UUP leader, insists Butler£bn in Covid aid was pushed through by Stormont ministersGail Walker, Editor-at-LargeOpinionA letter from NI in  to its younger self... hang in there, you do have a place in the worldLatestFA Cup final: Brendan Rodgers and Jonny Evans help Leicester City to historic victory over ChaCarrick Rangers manager Niall Currie keeping quiet on reasons for sudden resignation Seven Irish League permutations: How can Linfield or Coleraine win the league and what do we know about the race for Europe Rangers title success #right up there# with Liverpool#s Champions League win for manager Steven GerrardJonny Evans fit to start FA Cup final for Leicester City as Northern Ireland defender bids to end -year wait,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: ReutersREUTERS FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNarrow win: DUP leader-elect Edwin Poots. Photo: ReutersAndrew Madden and Gareth CrossMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMONDAYThe week kicked off with Edwin Poots setting out his stall for the job of DUP leader, vowing to end reactionary policy making.We can no longer sustain the ad hoc approach that has been a feature of recent years, with policy on the hoof and little regard to the wishes of the elected members who have to believe in and defend the policies of the party, he wrote in his manesto.During a debate on Northern Ireland’s first climate change bill in the Assembly, former nuclear submarine captain Steve Aiken acknowledged that he would seem an unlikely candidate to be an eco-warrior.He said that, while working in the Arctic while he was in the Navy, he observed a ,-year-old sea of ice. When he ed to the area a few years later “that ice had gone”.Jim Allister revealed to no one#s surprise that he isn#t a fan of the bill, pointing to its potential impact on the agri-food sector.“I am saying that the answer is not to take % of our animals and slaughter them or to take % of our production and export it to the depleting rainforests of Brazil and then sit back smugly and say, ‘Didn#t we do well # That is the ethos of the Bill, he said in the chamber.People, much as [DUP MLA Jim Wells] might not like it, will continue to buy meat. Do they buy the meat produced in north Antrim or the meat produced on land that has been stripped in the Amazon basin  That is an issue that politicians in the Western world have to consider.Ulster Unionist MLA Roy Beggs took issue with the emission targets in the bill, including a goal of zero emissions by . He said they are set over a compressed time frame and go way beyond UK Climate Change Committee targets.Green Party leader Clare Bailey, who tabled the bill, interjected. Does the member realise that his party#s manesto commits to net zero by , which is much faster and a much more compressed time frame  she said.I believe that that was a Westminster manesto, Mr Beggs replied.At a press conference addressing his resignation as UUP leader, Mr Aiken was asked which task was harder, commanding a nuclear submarine or leading the UUP. He wryly remarked: I think I#ll plead the fth on that one.TUESDAYThe climate change debate continued into Tuesday, with Jim Wells rounding on the Environment Minister, and his party colleague, Edwin Poots, over his opposition to the bill.Why are we giving planning permission for peat extraction and the development of peatlands when they have so much potential to store carbon  Why has the department not completed the area of special scientic interest, special protection area and special area of conservation designations  he said.The [conservation] Act came in in , and I am able to tell him how long ago that was because I was in the chamber when it passed. Here we are,  years later, and we still have not completed our [Areas of Special Scientic Interest] designation.Alliance#s Kellie Armstrong said: I thank the proposers of the motion it is an important debate. I will have to recommend myself for disciplinary action because I find myself agreeing with Mr Wells far too much.Oh no, replied Mr Wells.Sinn Fein#s Jemma Dolan raised a point of order later on in the chamber, saying she had secured an adjournment debate - a way of enabling the House to have a debate on a subject without considering a substantive motion - two weeks ago, but Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon released a statement on the same issue on Tuesday morning.That undermines the role of MLAs and the authority of the chamber to hold ministers to account. I ask the Speaker#s Office to look into this to see whether proper procedure and protocol were followed, she said.Speaker Alex Maskey sympathised: I say directly to the minister that, having seen that her statement was issued a number of hours ago, in advance of the adjournment debate that was scheduled for this afternoon in the order paper, I can understand why a member would feel aggrieved.It is not for me to judge why that happened, but I will write to the Executive again because I want to make sure that ministers reflect on when they issue statements, particularly on sitting days and when the minister is scheduled to come to a particular debate to make a statement.WEDNESDAYA potential sign of things to come was aired on Wednesday, when Edwin Poots no-showed a North South ministerial agriculture meeting. Nichola Mallon, the Infrastructure Minister, was also due to take part, stating it doesn#t bode wellthis is what the future holds. Powersharing requires leadership, she tweeted.It emerged Brexit minister Lord Frost and Secretary of State Brandon Lewis were in Northern Ireland on Monday meeting with the Loyalist Communities Council - but no one seemed to notice at the time.Independent MLA Trevor Lunn asked a Stormont officialshe knew Lord Frost was visiting.“It wasn’t wholly unexpected, but I wasn’t aware of the date in advance,” responded the official.Mr Lunn said: I think they must have smuggled him in and smuggled him out again.When the Assembly#s Economy Committee heard from Minister Diane Dodds on Wednesday, questions were raised around her own future.As she outlined her post-pandemic economic recovery plan Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson noted she might not be Economy Minister much longer.Edwin Poots has committed to reshuffling the DUP#s ministerial team.How do you see your successor, or a future mandate, taking forward your economy plan , Mr Dickson asked.Mrs Dodds replied: “What I do or I don#t do after this week or next week will be for the party leader and that is fine with me.THURSDAYThursday saw a meeting of the Health Committee, with members briefed on the topic of gambling addiction.Sinn Fein#s Colm Gildernew said he was “taken aback” before the pandemic to learn that one in  suicides “are linked to gambling addiction”.He asked an officialthere were any plans to develop services to tackle the problem, to which the official replied: There are no specic gambling addiction services.Nothing much gets past TUV leader Jim Allister. This week he received an answer to questions around why Union flags flown at Stormont to mark the birthday of Queen Elizabeth on April  were lowered before sunset. In a written response the Assembly Commission said the flags were lowered at .pm, ahead of the closure of the Assembly at pm, with restricted opening hours during the coronavirus pandemic. Previously the flags would have flown until just before pm.FRIDAYIt was a monumental day for unionism, with the DUP voting for their new leader. Outside party HQ in Belfast, Jim Wells was asked about the possibility of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson running as an MLA in his constituency in the next Assembly election.Mr Wells said Sir Jeffrey previously represented North Down and still has a lot of family there, however he is glad the Donaldsons on the electoral register voted for him the last time round.He hasn#t gone away, you know, he added.Alas, it was not be for Sir Jeffrey#s leadership ambitions, as he fell by two votes to Edwin Poots. The Agriculture Minister said during his acceptance speech he wanted to reach out to other unionists.Other unionists, it seems, aren#t going to give him an easy ride. Within minutes of the white smoke emerging from DUP HQ, outgoing Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken issued a statement calling for answers over the DUP#s Brexit dealings.Why did Edwin and ALL his colleagues endorse Boris Johnson’s proposals on October ,  for a regulatory border in the Irish Sea  Mr Aiken asked.“Why did Edwin and ALL his colleagues endorse Boris Johnson’s proposals on October ,  for border inspection posts to be establish at Northern Ireland’s ports Why did Edwin and ALL his colleagues endorse Boris Johnson’s proposals that all goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain must comply with EU rules and therefore be subject to the ongoing remit of the EU court Good luck, Edwin..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlyIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leSuzanne BreenOpinion‘Peasants’ Revolt’ as DUP big beasts defeated  Suzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCelebrations on the Shankill Road as Rangers win their th Scottish Premiership title.PlayEdwin Poots is elected DUP leaderLatest PoliticsSuzanne BreenOpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last longBoris Johnson promises to address legacy of the TroublesBeattie will have my full supporthe becomes UUP leader, insists Butler£bn in Covid aid was pushed through by Stormont ministersGail Walker, Editor-at-LargeOpinionA letter from NI in  to its younger self... hang in there, you do have a place in the worldLatestFA Cup final: Brendan Rodgers and Jonny Evans help Leicester City to historic victory over ChaCarrick Rangers manager Niall Currie keeping quiet on reasons for sudden resignation Seven Irish League permutations: How can Linfield or Coleraine win the league and what do we know about the race for Europe Rangers title success #right up there# with Liverpool#s Champions League win for manager Steven GerrardJonny Evans fit to start FA Cup final for Leicester City as Northern Ireland defender bids to end -year wait,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you have bought there in the last few years, then you should be quids in as values have taken a huge leap in the past  months. It#s so popular that supply isn#t meeting demand, as people moving in are there to stay, meaning fewer properties coming onto the market. The few that have recently become available are so sought-after that they have prompted bidding wars. Average property values here rose by £, in the past year to £,, but local agent Neil Templeton reckons that#s a conservative figure. A director of Templeton Robinson Estate Agents, he says: It#s been a good market since we came out of the first lockdown in June of last year but it has been particularly busy since Easter. I think that#s because people are seeing light at the end of the tunnel now, with the number of Covid cases down and vaccines being rolled out. While some people will have a tough time ahead because of employment, others have been told their jobs are safe. The dynamic of what people are looking for has changed and generally people want more space internally and externally. Also a lot of people have been told by their bosses that they will continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBelmont FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelmontPeople are attracted to this area by the great schools and many restaurants and shops and the close proximity of the City Airport. We also have something for everyone in terms of price brackets as there are houses from £, to £m.There are also people moving back home from England because they have the option of remote working. Neil says: They are looking for a better lestyle, a better education for their children, savings on school fees as well as a lower cost of living. These are people who maybe worked in London but have now been told they can work from home. We recently put a four-bedroom semi on the market at £, and had four bidders, three of them from England. The house sold for £,. The biggest increase has been in terraced properties, up by almost £, from £, to £,. He says better mortgage products - some at % LTV - have fuelled growth, especially for first-time buyers. If you can get your hands on a -% deposit then you can buy a terrace house in east Belfast and have mortgage payments which are lower than rent. People have been able to save money during the pandemic and a lot of first-time buyers are being assisted by their parents to get on the housing ladder.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chair of DTUC, Niall McCarroll, says that as a working class movement DTUC has provided a voice for workers and social justice campaigns. It aims to further reach out with the launch of a local workers survey, as it extends its solidarity with the people of Derry and District demanding an end to the many hardships which workers and their families experience and have experienced for far too long. Mr McCarroll says: Like everyone  I have listened to plenty of guff over the years. Hang in there is the message from all sections of the establishment, we are sympathetic and very empathetic we know things are dficult butyou keep working for nothing with no improvements things will improve. googletag.cmd.push Nurses, hotel workers, health care assistants, nursing home workers, shop workers, classroom assistants, retail workers, community, voluntary sector workers and indeed call centre staff have all heard this and still they wait, we all wait. We need to organise and begin to direct our own affairs, we need to represent ourselves because we are not being represented. He adds: Derry Trades Union Council call upon all local workers to join a trade union, get active in your local branch and shape your trade union into a fighting, working class organisation. This is how we will change our lives make our communities better, create a culture of solidarity across all workplaces, uniting all workers. Lets begin to create this new modern workers movement. googletag.cmd.push Unionised workers of the past, including our local factory workers championed the cause of labour and won many of the rights we take for granted today such as maternity pay,  hour days and weekends off. Todays demands are not being won, workers need decent pay and we must collectively mobilise to end the scourge of poverty pay, creating the situation were no worker needs to work two jobs to survive. By completing the DTUC survey we can commence the call to mobilise, use this survey to bring us together - together we can make a dference - together we can deliver for each other.     We are told by the privileged few that we must wait to gain the same privileges. Time is up.

Jade Bradley, who is originally from Hatmore Park in the Foyle Springs area of the city, is the founder of Restore Nutrition, a wellness company that specialises in helping people with their nutrition to deliver a better quality of le. Jade embarked on her own mental and physical health journey several years ago having struggled with anxiety. She used a blended approach which included yoga, meditation, music, therapy and the input from a kinesiologist that advised on food issues and intolerances. googletag.cmd.push Within two months of implementing these changes, Jade saw a massive change resulting in better sleep, more energy and a feeling of being more ‘restored.’ It was this that sparked her desire to educate herself in naturopathic nutrition. She moved to London and studied at the College of Naturopathic Medicine and became a member of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council. She launched Restore Nutrition in  and the company has since gone from strength to strength. working with over  private clients and organisations including, Seagate, Business in the Community, Hurt, Waterside Neighbourhood Partnership, Belfast Food Network, Hillcrest, Culmore Hub, Foyle Women’s Information Group, Derry Well Woman and Youth Action. googletag.cmd.push Speaking about her new programme, Jade said: “We are living in a stressed out society, and having the main pillars of health and wellbeing in place is essential to help deal with stress and anxiety. If the fundamentals aren’t in place, it is impossible for us to excel.” Jade said these fundamentals were more important than ever given the challenging times we are all in. She added: “I centre our work around four pillars which we delve into on the ‘Kick Start’ programme namely: hydration, reducing toxic load, restoring with whole foods and managing stress and sleep.” She said she has found most people want a quick fix or a magic pill when it came to their health and wellbeing journey.     “Unfortunately, this does not exist,” she said. “It is best to make small changes incrementally and embark on this journey in stages starting off with the fundamentals which is exactly what we do in our new programme. “Furthermore, it is so important to tackle mental health issues with an all-round approach and this is why I have worked with local mental health therapist, Caroline McMenamin, on many projects over the past two years and plan to do more collaborations throughout the year.” The ‘Kick Start’ nutrition programme is available for business groups, charities, community groups and inidual attendees and runs over four weeks in one-hour sessions. You can obtain more information, costs and sign up by emailing Jade:info@ restorenutrition.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Paul Cassidy is listed to start for the second time after making his full debut against Offaly in Tullamore last season. There is a first inclusion for Gareth McKinless since Derrys  All-Ireland Qualier win over Cavan. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McFaul played virtually every minute under Gallagher last season, bar a th minute late black card in the McKenna Cup against Monaghan and being replaced in the th minute of their win over Louth. He is one of four Glen men listed to start on Saturday. Danny Tallon, who started all  games last season, isnt included in the starting line-up. There is no place for Slaughtneil defender Karl McKaigue who has made a full recovery from the torn Achilles sustained on club hurling championship duty last summer. The only three members of the current  yet to make their debuts are Bellaghy duo Ronan McFaul and Conleth McShane, as well as Glen goalkeeper Connlan Bradley. googletag.cmd.push Goals from Patrick Kearney and Paul Cassidy helped Derry to victory when the sides met last season at Celtic Park. Derry and Longford have met eight times in the last two decades, in league and championship. The Oakleafers have to go back to  for their last win at Pearse Park, when two Anthony Tohill goals and an inspired performance from current selector Enda Muldoon put Derry on their way to victory.

By hook or by crook wed have liked to have got out of there with a victory, Gallagher commented after Derrys - to - win over Longford on Saturday night. We performed fairly well...very well at times in the second half. It was a lot more comfortable than wed ever have expected, he added. An upbeat Derry boss said the victory was a great reward for the efforts of the squad in the off-season. After getting the full squad back on board after last seasons Derry county finals, he felt the build-up to the Armagh championship game pleased him, after which the squad were left in no doubt of the effort required before Christmas, ahead of their  promotion push. googletag.cmd.push They have done the work with Peterand with Anne Marieand I am delighted with the condition they are in, Gallagher pointed out. Derry were six points clear at half time of Saturdays clash in a rainswept Pearse Park, but Gallagher admitted it shouldve been more. I was bitterly disappointed we only had eight points at half-time, we shouldve been sitting with - or - at our ease and that was Niallkicking a couple of fties in tough conditions. I felt we left scores too easily behind and to be honest,Longford had been more clinical or when you move up the gears against opposition higher up the isions wed have suffered for it. googletag.cmd.push Fermanagh were narrow winners over Ulster champions Cavan on Saturday night and come to Owenbeg next week for a top of the table clash.

Eaacutebha Mullanand Ciaroacuten Mullan , from Ballerin, have written about the loss of their father Kieran Squealer Mullan in , when the siblings were just five and three years old. Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy. With cold shock, I realise that means hes been gone for  years longer than I knew him,” wrote Eaacutebha. googletag.cmd.push “We were only five and three when he took his own le. For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go. Everyone thinks we might have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago. “But they dont know how it feels to look at the same few photographs, knowing there will never be any more. “They dont know how strange it feels to think we once had two parents. They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

Government Boundaries Commissioner Sarah Havlin has outlined further details about her review of the  district council boundaries and the proposed timetable and process for public consultation. This includes publishing a short information video to outline the review process and highlighting why and how people can get involved. This also coincides with the start of a series of ‘Meet the Commissioner’ briefing events with council representatives from across all  councils. By the end of July this year, the Commissioner plans to publish provisional proposals, outlining any proposed changes to local government boundaries. googletag.cmd.push The closing date for written submissions about these provisional proposals will be September  this year. After this, a series of public hearings will be held to gather further feedback and these will be subject to the relevant covid- public health guidance at that time. Thereafter, there will be a period of analysis of the representations and public hearing reports, before the preparation of revised proposals which will again be subject to further consultation. The review is something that by law has to happen every eight- years and although the last review took place in   with the final recommendations from that providing the basis for the last review of local government boundaries which after legislation and elections etc, took effect from  when the new councils came into being. googletag.cmd.push The last review, which saw Derry City Council and Strabane District Council combine to make Derry City and Strabane District Council, coincided with the change in local government which saw the signicant change from  to  councils so was more substantial in nature. This review will take into account changes in electoral changes housing changes among other things since  and make recommendation on the boundaries of the  current districts and the ious wards that make them up. It’s hard to know what the initial proposals will show as modelling electoral analysis etc is ongoing but there may well be some local government boundaries changing.     The review will also examine the potential for changes to the names of local wards to reflect local considerations. The review, when completed next year, will then need to be legislated on before any actual boundary changes would take effect. Boundary Commissioner, Sarah Havlin, is encouraging everyone with an interest to get involved in what she described this important review. everyone with an interest to get involved. “We have also published an information video to highlight how and why people should get involved. The outcomes will inform the make-up of local government in the foreseeable future andwill consider the impact of electorate changes since  and other recent developments. “The process is about independently ensuring electoral equality and fairness across Northern Ireland, with the aim that all the wards within a district should, as far as possible, have a similar number of electors. “With that I mind, it’s important that we hear the views of local people and their representatives on these matters, and I would encourage people to regularly check our website and social media channels for more information on how they can have their voice heard in this process.” Review details can be found athttps:www. lgbc-ni.org.uk or via Twitter and Facebook @LGBCNI.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Before inter-county football shoehorned the club game into whatever orice it can find, the senior and reserve double header on a Sunday was set in stone across Derry. With cars filtering in the lane from after three oclock, stalwarts would perch themselves along the fence to run their eye over the reserve action. The senior managers ears would often be burning, as some doting Daddies would question their sons non-selection for the seniors. “That man hasnt a clue,” youd sometimes hear. A stellar showing in the reserve game would have you hauled ashore early, to stay fresh for a cameo senior appearance. Some saw it as elevation. The player himself would be frustrated at having his vintage display cut short. googletag.cmd.push Thats the problem with almost being on the senior team. Youre caught between two stools. Everyone  knows where they stand in the pecking order. Johnny must be in the seniors plans,” the auld hands would mumble as he trotted off. He might get five minutes in the senior game. He might get . He might get none. It just depended on how things were going. Thats how it was. If another player on the reserve team, lets call him Paddy, kicked the last two scores, made a goal line block or emptied some man out over the sideline, hed dine off legendary status. googletag.cmd.push “Youd some game Paddy,” somebody would tell him, over the wire, as he pulled on a senior sub jersey. “Youd be starting in the seniors every weekI was over that team.” By the time Paddy pulls up a stool at the bar later that night, and puts manners in his first pint, his bone crunching shoulder challenge has now exaggerated ten times over. “He put yer man through the wire,” would be the latest. And nobody is going to dampen a good story. That was Sunday every week in the club leagues. Tuesday night at training was the time to put in your shout for the senior team next week. And so the cycle continued.     The alternative is playing the reserve game afterwards, with anyone not getting a decentof time in the senior game will get their fill of football. But the self esteem must take an awful battering as almost everyone leaves after the senior game. It depends what your take is. As much as that model served the GAA well, it has its downfall. With the level of preparation at club level going through the roof, the whole weeks diet, rest and social le revolves around the Sunday. Social media went into meltdown last week, with everyone salivating over their Friday night slot for senior games, like Downs tried and tested formula. In theory, it is a great idea. Friday night pints. Saturday and Sunday to take your better half or family out for the day Training on a Monday and Wednesday night, ready to go again. There are two drawbacks. At the height of the Celtic Tiger, with players working in Dublin or further afield, it was a squeeze to get home for a training session at eight oclock, never mind racing home for six oclock to play a reserve game as part of a double header. Secondly, splitting the reserve and senior games to dferent days leaves twice the amount of travel, for the fringe senior players who will be on both squads, while leaving you back where you started with a reserve game on the Sunday. For me, Saturday six oclock and half seven is the answer. It is somewhere in between. It leaves Saturday night free for players to do as they please and get themselves in order for training the following week. The only people it will affect are those who are mixing their GAA with the local soccer or rugby team. But, maybe this is where a compromise needs to be reached. In some places, soccer and rugby keep players fitness ticking over during the off-season. And vice versa. Rather than going loggerheads, clubs could select a certain number of their games for Sunday until the soccer and rugby seasons are over, before moving to Saturday. It wouldnt be every club. In a way, it also gives local GAA clubs an advantage. How many times have you wanted to go and watch the crunch game of the weekend, but cant because you have a game of your own. I always use the example of going to watch Lavey and Ballinderry in a late Sunday evening game. The rest of Derry had the chance to call in on their way home. There was a bumper crowd and an electric atmosphere for players. Everybody is a winner. So of the  games in the Derry A and B leagues, have half on a Sunday, half on a Saturday and one on a Friday night. Set the dates in stone, which gives players six free Sundays they wouldnt normally have had. There is the option of taking your kids to the pool, book a weekend away, nurse a hangover or watch a county game. The licence to do any of those things will make GAA less of a strain on the weekend. The Sunday fixture does suit the supporter, but they arent obliged to go to a game every weekend andthey do, itll take up three hours at the most. Players are dferent. Theyll dedicate Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, with all the sacrices they make in between. Their voice should be heard above the rest. Imagine the weekend Paddy would have, living off kicking three points to win the reserve game and pummelling the oppositions hatchet man in the process.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ruaidhri Higgins’ team matched the champions every step of the way and the new manager has now taken seven points from his three away games. It took Rovers just over  minutes to really trouble Nathan Gartside and unsurprisingly it was Graham Burke at the heart of it, as he made a direct run at goal, playing a one-two with Rory Gaffney before breaking into the area, but his shot was pushed behind for a corner by the City goalkeeper. googletag.cmd.push Rovers were beginning to build momentum as half time approached, but they were very nearly caught out when James Akintunde dispossessed Ronan Finn on halfway, and picked out the run of Parkhouse, who turned inside and shot over the bar from  yards. Derry City needed Gartside to keep the scores level however, as the home side finally carved open their defence on  minutes, Sean Gannon’s low cross picking out Gaffney, who turned onto his left foot but couldn’t beat the City goalkeeper from close range. It was a hugely important save from Gartside. The game exploded into le early in the second half when Akintunde was brought down by Sean Hoare in the area, and referee Graham Kelly pointed to the penalty spot. It was a terric opportunity for City to take the lead and it was one which Will Patching did not waste as he sent Alan Mannus the wrong way to make it -. googletag.cmd.push That lead lasted barely six minutes however as Rovers levelled, and it was Rory Gaffney who got the goal, shrugging off Ciaran Coll before firing past Gartside from the angle to make it -. Both sides pushed for the winning goal in the closing stages and there was more drama, with both teams finishing the game with ten men, Sean Hoare red-carded for Rovers on  minutes, and Danny Lafferty receiving a second caution in the th minute. Teams SHAMROCK ROVERS: Alan Mannus, Sean Hoare, Roberto Lopes, Lee Grace, Dylan Watts , Ronan Finn, Graham Burke, Danny Mandroiu , Liam Scales, Gary O’Neill, Rory Gaffney .

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere. We need to put it up to the minister. We are in unprecedented times.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon said she too was disappointed and urged Mr Swann to reconsider.ldquoThis is such an important issue, she said. ldquoWe are coming out of Covid and we need the restoration of services at the Downe. I am very disappointed, she remarked.Fellow Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin said he acknowledged that Mr Swann was under pressure, but suggested that a virtual meeting could easily be arranged.ldquoThe Downe Hospital is extremely important to the people I represent, he said. ldquoWe need the minister to come out and say he is as passionate about the Downe as we are.His SDLP colleague, John Trainor, said the council needed to ldquoexplore every avenue, adding that councillors should ask the Stormont Health Committee to interveneMr Swann was to refuse to meet then a second time.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who nursed in a Covid unit at the height of the pandemic, said she wished to ldquoput on record her disappointment.She added: Knowing how important these two hospitals are and having worked in them, it was a weak response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-45m.jpg","title":"£45m investment needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour  ","story":"INVESTMENT in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities, according to a major new report published on Monday.Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots has published the findings of the report which highlights the investment needed in Northern Irelandrsquos fishing industry and seafood sectors.The report was produced by the Fishing and Seafood Development Programmewhich was established by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsto conduct a strategic review of the opportunities for developing the sea fishing and seafood sectors across the province, including the potential role of new public investment in infrastructure.Focusing on recommendations in relation to capital investment at the main fishery harbours, the report highlights a number of challenges and opportunities for the wider industry that could be addressed through a future fisheries financial support scheme.The recommendations for Ardglass include enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses, while the development of Kilkeel harbour as a ldquopotential Irish Sea hub for the fishing and maritime economy by increasing port capacity and shore side facilities is highlighted.More generally, the detailed report highlights the need to create conditions resulting in investment in more modern fuel efficient vessels with low emissions and better facilities for crews, further reducing the environmental impact of the fishing fleet, adopting novel technology to expand marine aquaculture and taking advantage of EU exit opportunities to build exports of high value seafood.The report confirms that a recent survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass revealed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change. Of course, this will not be easy but I hope that with government and industry working together we can build new infrastructure, become more prosperous, improve the marine environment and enhance our reputation as suppliers of quality sustainable seafood.Mr Poots said his department will be engaging with stakeholders to discuss the findings of the report over the next few weeks and hopes that the next phase of work towards harbour investment can proceed shortly.He also confirmed that later in the year DAERA will be consulting on plans for a future fisheries fund to address the wider needs of the fishing industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Cara.jpg","title":"Cara opens first ever Irish Roots festival  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF schoolgirl was honoured at the weekend when she was asked to open the inaugural global Irish Roots online festival.Twelve year-old Cara Mailey is no stranger to appearing in television having appeared in several CBBC programmes over the last two years.However, on Sunday she became a storyteller for the festival which seeks to celebrate Irish people around the world with dferent skin colours.Along with Orla McKeating, the founder of Still I Rise Diversity Storytelling, Cara read two stories mdash Happy in Our Skin and I Am Whole.Both books celebrate dferent skin colours and celebrated the uniqueness of peoplesrsquo skin colours.Cara, who attends Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, was born with achonlasia, a form of dwarfism.She also had the opportunity to share her story, what she likes about her skin and then she also talked about what it was like being dferent to other children her age.Orla also read a third book called the The Little Crayon, a childrenrsquos story book written by -year-old Amelia Kai, also from Belfast.The daughter of Tricia Mailey, a teacher at Cedar Integrated Primary School in Crossgar, Cara has a big personality and has appeared on CBBCrsquos Dengineers and Crafty Party.Tricia said: ldquoCara has read for Still I Rise now for about a year. I think they are amazing.

Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward. Car parking will be a key requirement in the assessment process and indeed planning approval process.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car park is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.As part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics recently appeared on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.Downpatrick councillors say they are acutely aware that the opportunity to redevelop a huge area of town centre land will not happen again, with the redevelopment plan having the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-DundrumCricket.jpg","title":"Dundrum thirds make historic league debut  ","story":"SUNDAY was a momentous day in the history of Dundrum Cricket Club.For the first time the club have been able to enter a thirds team into league cricket and the Meadow was the venue as Dundrum took the field against Ards seconds with a team packed with experience and plenty of youth too.Dundrum captain Neil Reilly won the toss and elected to bat on a super wicket that the ground staff had prepared for the seconds the day before, but had not been used due to bad weather.In the first over, opener Eoin Moag nicked a gooddelivery which was caught frombehind by the Ards wicketkeeper,.This was followed in the second over by a Jack Calvert drive catching the edge of the bat and flying straight up to be caught, leaving Dundrum on  for .The tricky start was made worse when the captain was run out by a sharp piece of fielding from Ards, leaving the hosts on  for .This brought together a partnership between Keba Butler and Kristofer McNeill which finally found traction and started to produce a decent score.By the time Kristofer had been bowled for , the score had risen to  for  with some cracking shots by both batsman which on another day would have produced even more runs, but on a damp outfield restricted the number of fours.Andrew Hammond came in and produced a fast hitting nine to supplement Kebarsquos continued run chase which culminated in a not out score of  by the end of the allotted  overs.Ards came into bat and had a fast start, reaching  without loss after only three overs,.The captainrsquos second over proved to be a turning point in picking up two wickets for just a single run.

It was a bit inexplicable the way the three goals happened so quickly and two of them came from our own turnovers.This Sunday Down are scheduled to face off against Carlow on home ground with the match set to begin at pm.

His plan to split the DUP leadership from first minister poses dficulties, not least the matter of who he will make NI’s head of government.If Mr Poots strikes a friendly tone, it will be easier for him to be firm on the Irish Sea border. The worst of all worlds would be to look tough but act weak on matters such as legacy and the Northern Ireland Protocol. We warmly congratulate Mr Poots and his deputy Paula Bradley on their elections to lead the DUP, and wish them well at the helm of the biggest unionist party.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

That has appeared to be clear since Arlene Foster’s downfall two weeks ago, but became unavoidably clear yesterday.Edwin Poots carries the DUP in his DNA. Unquestionably, he is more right wing, more instinctively hardline and more socially conservative than Mrs Foster.But this is about far more than simply the revenge of the Paisleyites – although that is part of this complex plot.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The central clue to understanding what happened yesterday is the election of Paula Bradley. It would be impossible to find a DUP MLA more antithetical to a Free Presbyterian takeover of the DUP.The North Belfast MLA supports gay rights, supports abortion being legalised, and publicly criticised Gregory Campbell’s ‘curry my yoghurt’ Irish language jibe.The signicance of her election as DUP deputy leader – to replace a Free Presbyterian former assistant to Dr Paisley, Nigel Dodds – is not that it happened, but how it happened.Yesterday Mr Poots worked to help clear the way for Mrs Bradley’s victory over Mr Campbell, the ultimate old school DUP man.Mr Poots’ campaign manager, Paul Frew, was also a candidate for deputy leader. Yesterday morning he was part way through his speech to the electoral college when the North Antrim MLA announced that he was withdrawing from the race.Several days ago, one source in Mr Poots’s camp had predicted Mr Frew – whose central concern is reform of the DUP – would not let his name go forward for deputy leader and that Ms Bradley would be the victor in that contest.Nevertheless, his sudden withdrawal left veteran Jim Wells “dumbfounded”. Last night he said “it is obvious that there were some discussions between him and Paula Bradley’s camp.“It basically boiled down to whetherPaula Bradley became deputy leader, some of here folk were prepared to vote for Edwin Poots.“I have no doubt that Paula Bradley voted for Edwin Poots.”However, Mr Wells said that he had not voted for Ms Bradley. Yet he did not vote for Mr Campell either and instead abstained. He said that a DUP MP had also abstained.Why would DUP MLAs and MPs prefer the somewhat odd pairing of Mr Poots and Mrs Bradley, rather than the more obvious right-wing ticket of Mr Poots and Mr Campbell  And why would traditionalist supporters of Mr Poots abstain in the deputy leadership vote rather than back a social conservative, Mr Campbell The answer explains what all of this has been about. This was about overthrowing what had become the DUP’s royal family, an elite who survived in powerful positions under dferent leaders, just as the Queen remains when the prime minister changes.Mr Campbell and Sir Jeffrey were seen as people less likely to shake things up.The one signicant word spoken by Mr Poots on his way into party headquarters yesterday was “reform”. That was the key element of his manesto. That was what his supporters believed he represents: A new broom who will transform how the DUP operates, and refresh its small centralised team of power-brokers.That explains why Ms Bradley signed the letter of no confidence in Mrs Foster even though, like Mrs Foster, she abstained in the Assembly vote on banning gay conversion therapy.Expect Mr Poots to talk tough but the key thing to watch is whether he acts tough.It will be hard for the minister who allowed his officials to build the Irish Sea border and who to this day allows them to operate it to suddenly adopt a radically dferent approach.It will be equally hard for the pragmatist who two years ago was willing to accept an Irish language act when even Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was opposing it to now suddenly recant on that commitment.Those issues remain unresolved in this contest, largely because both candidates were kept away from public scrutiny.Now they will have to be addressed.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area.

There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are also around  to  cases of the India iant in parts of Scotland, including Glasgow, with these cases again connected to travel.The India Covid iant, officially known as B.., was first detected in India in October.It has been designated a ldquoiant of concern by PHE as it is thought to be at least as transmissible as the iant detected in Kent last year, known as B, which is now dominant in the UK.PHE said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the new Indian iant is more serious than previous mutations, nor is there evidence which indicates that this version of the Indian iant is resistant to current vaccines.Health experts said they ldquohavenrsquot seen any hint of a current Covid iant that can fully evade the effectiveness of vaccines.On Wednesday , the European Medicines Agency said it was ldquopretty confident that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant, a view that has been echoed by some British scientists.However, Professor James Naismith from the University of Oxford said not enough is known to say for sure whether the iant could frustrate the UKrsquos vaccination programme.Speaking on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme, he said: ldquoThe vaccines donrsquot  per cent prevent infection for people.ldquoWhat they do is, they almost  per cent prevent hospitalisation and serious illness.ldquoWe donrsquot know enough to know yet whether the Indian strain will behave dferently than that.ldquoSo even the regular virus can infect people who have been vaccinated and sometimes you do get reinfection.Could the iant delay lockdown ending The growing number of India Covid iant cases in the UK has sparked concerns that the lting of lockdown restrictions, which is set for  June in England, could now be delayed.Ministers have also not ruled out re-introducing local lockdowns in areas where the iant of concern is increasing.Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said that the government will make decisions based on the data, and measures will be eased ldquoat a pace and in a way which is safe.Symptoms to look forThe main symptoms of coronavirus to look for include:a high temperature ndash this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back a new, continuous cough ndash this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste ndash this means youve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normalMost people with symptoms have at least one of these symptoms, although some do not experience any.

The modernisation plans will also support a further  jobs during construction and development. Located at the busy junction of Dromore Road and James Street, the store will occupy an entire space of , sq. metres – more than double the size of its existing store – which will include an expansive sales floor of , sq. metres. The planning application lodged with Fermanagh and Omagh District Council will see the demolition of a neighbouring pub and private dwelling to make way for the expansion on a site that will also incorporate a-space car park with two electric vehicle charging points and new, complementary landscaping. Construction plans encompass Lidl Northern Ireland’s bold ‘concept’ design which prioritises sustainability, spacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms, employee and baby-changing facilities which will dramatically enhance a high-quality shopping experience. The site will also include a large warehouse and improved employee welfare facilities. The application follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in September  which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community. Conor Boyle, regional director for Lidl Northern Ireland, said: “We are delighted to confirm plans for a replacement store in Omagh which will see the existing store at James Street in the town double in size to provide a dramatically-enhanced shopping experience and new jobs for the area. Centrally located in the west of the region, the Omagh store serves a burgeoning and thriving community base and is conveniently positioned next to the A which is a major primary route and commuter corridor. As a major investor in our communities and in our local economy, the Omagh store is an important location for us, and I am thrilled to reaffirm our commitment to the local area as part of this multimillion-pound investment. We hope to receive planning permission for the site in the coming weeks and we look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store later this year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eceefaabeabfcb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eccafffcebe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
