Meghan Markle revealed her dreams about becoming a princess...Share this articleMarkle Sr said: \u0027I was going to recount the funny story about how she broke the news to me about dating Harry: \u0027Daddy, I\u0027ve met a man… Daddy, he\u0027s English… Daddy, he\u0027s a prince.\u0027\u0027I thought it was a cute story. Like any father I wanted to say a few words. I was going to thank the Royal Family for welcoming my beautiful daughter into their family. But it was a speech that I was never going to be allowed to give. That hurt.\u0027He also launched a defense of his decision to speak to the media and claimed his Mail on Sunday interview would be his last – although he went on to speak to a tabloid newspaper less than 24 hours later.Speaking to The Sun on Sunday night, he added: \u0027I want to say good luck and God bless to my daughter. I don\u0027t expect to see her or hear back from her — and that\u0027s OK.\u0027All I was doing was saying things I wanted to say. I just want to re-establish the relationship with my daughter.\u0027I now want to go on vacation somewhere to try and get some peace.\u0027The latest round of interviews come just seven days after the 74-year-old spent nine hours with the Mail on Sunday, during which he admitted to a drug-taking past, said Princess Diana would have \u0027loathed\u0027 the way he is being treated and hit out at Prince Harry – saying: \u0027I don\u0027t care if Harry never speaks to me again, I\u0027ll survive.\u0027    The source accused Markle Sr of selling salacious interviews to the press, and claims he has spoken to the media more than he has tried to contact Meghan           Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha, 53, has also turned on her and has given multiple interviews slamming the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himselfHis outbursts in the press follow a series of statements made to gossip website TMZ during the period around the royal wedding in May, following the paparazzi photo scandal.Although Markle Sr had been due to attend – and had his name printed in the program – he pulled out last minute after claiming to have suffered a heart attack.Despite telling the Mail on Sunday that he spent the day in a San Diego hospital bed, Markle Sr actually watched the nuptials from a $31-a-night Airbnb in Baja Malibu – a scruffy residential compound close to his home in San Antonio del Mar.He returned home on the Monday after the wedding and was pictured purchasing a creamy drink from Starbucks en route.Since then, the retired Emmy winner has repeatedly spoken out about his daughter and has insisted that he will continue to do so until she contacts him.He has also been pictured out and about in Los Angeles, where he was spotted purchasing a McDonalds meal on his birthday last month. Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Markle Sr has been repeatedly pictured tucking into fast food – including McDonalds Happy Meals and KFC the latter shortly after he revealed he had had a heart attack.Although ex-wife Doria has remained silent about the Markle debacle currently engulfing the royal family, Meghan\u0027s half-siblings have spoken out – with sister Samantha describing the Duchess\u0027s treatment of her father as \u0027inhumane\u0027.She told the Mirror newspaper on Monday: \u0027There would be no just reason for her not to want him in her life, as he was good enough to use to make her everything she is.\u0027Samantha, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, later took to Twitter to lambaste her half-sister, describing her as \u0027heartless, arrogant and inhumane\u0027 in a series of late-night messages.The 53-year-old was echoed by her brother Thomas Markle Jr, 51, of Grants Pass, Oregon, who also slammed the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himself.He told the Mirror: \u0027It\u0027s heartbreaking to see how this has changed her and the devastation it has caused to my family.\u0027Anyone who saw Meg when she was growing up knew her and my dad were inseparable. Now it looks as though they may never speak again.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/14/06/4F14338B00000578-0-image-m-85_1534224652550.jpg","title":"LuAnn Lesseps reveals relapsed watermelon martinis ros six pack beer","story":"\u0027I\u0027ll drink the whole bottle and then look for more.

Presley told the court that before they married, she and Lockwood discussed having a pre-nup agreement but none was ever signed. Lisa Marie Presley is seen second from right with daughter Riley Keough, and her twin girls who she had with Lockwood (far left) in October 2017Both Presley, 50, and Lockwood, 57, signed the post-nup a year after their January 2006 wedding when Presley was worth almost $63 million and Lockwood\u0027s net worth was zero.Lockwood, wants the document torn up, calling it invalid because, he claims, he was coerced into signing it, he didn\u0027t read it properly, his lawyer at the time - who has since died - didn\u0027t explain the agreement to him, and he doesn\u0027t remember the period when the post-nup was negotiated and signed.But Presley\u0027s attorney, Gary Fishbein, has fought back in court papers filed at LA Superior Court, accusing Lockwood of \u0027feigning amnesia or ignorance\u0027 and saying he \u0027had the full and complete opportunity to negotiate the terms of the agreement, was competently represented by counsel… and entered into the agreement freely and voluntarily, without duress or coercion.\u0027 On Monday, Presley took the witness stand  and accused Lockwood, of secretly running up \u0027possibly millions\u0027 on her credit card.\u0027I uncovered that he had been in control of finances for the 10 years before,\u0027 she told Judge Dianna Gould-Saltman at Los Angeles Superior on the first day of the expected four-day trial. \u0027He had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly millions on my credit card.\u0027 When Presley angrily confronted musician Lockwood in March 2016, three months before she filed for orce, he didn\u0027t deny running up the credit card bills, she said.And she insisted that he sign an agreement consenting to sell all his guitars, recording equipment, computers and other musical equipment to help make up for some of the credit card losses. \u0027It allowed me to pay off some of the Tennessee state taxes I owed,\u0027 she added.

Did you hold a gun to his head? Did you threaten to leave him if he didn\u0027t sign?\u0027 Presley answered \u0027No\u0027 to all three questions. And when Fishbein asked her, \u0027Did he tell you that he never wanted anything from you,\u0027 she answered, \u0027Yes, he did.\u0027 When Fishbein asked her if the spousal support clause of the pre-nup - in which both she and Lockwood agreed not to seek spousal support from the other if they orced - was important to her, Presley said, \u0027Very.\u0027 Presley admitted that she did pay spousal support to her first husband, Danny Keough, when they orced but she added, with a chuckle, that she didn\u0027t have to pay support to husband number 2, Michael Jackson, or husband number 3, actor Nicholas Cage. Earlier in the day, giving his version of the couple\u0027s fight over the credit card in March 2016, Lockwood told the court that Presley \u0027was extremely upset. We were having an argument about a credit card.\u0027 He added that he agreed to sell all his musical equipment \u0027to appease her.\u0027 Asked by his lawyer, Sturman, why he signed the post-nup in 2007, Lockwood said: \u0027Because my wife wanted me to.\u0027 He said she became angry when he first hesitated to sign after his lawyer told him there were possible issues in the agreement that needed to be sorted out. But he signed anyway, he said. \u0027She\u0027s not a take-no-for-an-answer kind of woman,\u0027 he said of his soon-to-be-ex wife.Asked if he would like the court to find that the pre-nup agreement is invalid, he added, \u0027I believe it\u0027s something the court should decide.\u0027 Lockwood told the court that when he and Presley separated in June 2016, he had nowhere to go so he first stayed in a Holiday Inn, then \u0027couch-surfed\u0027 for about two years, and has been making around $2,000-$2,500 a month working as a store clerk, a factory worker, teaching guitar and playing guitar in session recordings. He said that he\u0027s now living with his girlfriend Stephanie to whom he\u0027s engaged to be married.The revelation prompted Presley\u0027s attorney to ask, \u0027Do you know that when you re-marry you would lose the spousal support from your previous marriage? Does that change your mind about getting married again?\u0027 Lockwood answered, \u0027I don\u0027t know about that.\u0027 Presley - who was in court in a black dress and beige coat and ankle boots - said she doesn\u0027t want to pay up and, countered Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Sturman: \u0027She\u0027s feeling angry and vindictive. She wants him on the street. She\u0027s fine if he has nothing.\u0027Earlier in his opening statement, Presley\u0027s lawyer Fishbein told Judge Gould-Saltman that he found it \u0027incredible and unbelievable\u0027 that Lockwood\u0027s \u0027position is that he didn\u0027t read the post-nuptial agreement - which he signed twice.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t need to have graduated from MIT to understand that you are waiving spousal support,\u0027 added Fishbein who also questioned Lockwood\u0027s contention that when he signed the post-nup, his attorney - now deceased - didn\u0027t explain it to him.\u0027This attorney had been practicing law since 1956 - he had more than 40 years experience in family law. \u0027Now Lockwood is trying to get out from under a agreement he voluntarily agreed to and signed. He wants a chunk of cash and a bunch of spousal support.\u0027 Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Sturman hit back telling the court that Presley, her lawyers and business manager took an \u0027unfair advantage\u0027 of Lockwood when they persuaded him to sign the post-nup. \u0027They cooked the books - they wanted him to sign something they thought could be enforceable later on.\u0027 Despite the post-nup Sturman told the court, \u0027Spouses have a fiduciary (financial) duty to each other. \u0027Miss Presley is living off her inherited wealth….and Mr Lockwood has little or nothing. He is living at the poverty level. (Presley) is feeling angry and vindictive. She wants him on the street. She\u0027s fine if he has nothing.\u0027 Lockwood - who wore a blue suit and tie and a black shirt in court Monday - told Fishbein under questioning that didn\u0027t remember signing the prenup. \u0027I don\u0027t really understand contracts,\u0027 he said, adding that he didn\u0027t find \u0027contracts and legalese interesting.\u0027 But, he continued: \u0027Had I read it I would not have signed it…I think it\u0027s unfair.\u0027 The trial continues. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/15/17/4F1D6D3100000578-6063111-image-a-44_1534349159679.jpg","title":"Teacher relationships pupils faces stuck off","story":"    Elizabeth Smillie was allegedly found naked with a 17-year-old student after they began dating while she taught at Gleniffer High School in PaisleyA female teacher is accused of lying naked on top of a teenage schoolgirl and having inappropriate relationships with two other pupils over Facebook.Elizabeth Smillie was also seen kissing and holding hands with the same girl at one of Scotland\u0027s biggest family parks, the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) heard.The music teacher from Renfrewshire faces a total of four allegations ranging from 2010 to 2012.Smillie is also said to have \u0027conducted inappropriate relationships\u0027 via text and Facebook with two other pupils. It is claimed the teacher was found naked with the 17-year-old student - referred to as Pupil C - after they began dating while she taught at Gleniffer High School in Paisley.Ms Smillie was not present or represented at the hearing, but denies inappropriate conduct.

A West German police officer was also killed in the attack.The terrorist attack took place from approximately 4:30am local time on September 5, 1972 until about 1:30am am local time on September 6, 1972.The incident started as a hostage crisis in the early morning hours of September 5, 1972 after eight armed members of the Black September terror group infiltrated the Munich Olympic Village and used stolen keys to enter two apartments being used by the Israeli Olympic team.Some team members resisted the intrusion, ultimately leading to the deaths of two of them. Ultimately, the terror group took nine hostages, with a spokesman for them demanding the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel and Red Army Faction leaders Ulrike Meinhof and Andreas Baader in West Germany. Black September also demanded a plane for their own escape.After debating whether to engage in negotiations with the terrorist group, West German authorities ultimately determined that a rescue attempt would be the only way to solve the crisis. They decided to feign an agreement with Black September, allowing them to transport the bound hostages to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base nearby.          Nine hostages were taken by the Black September terrorist group during the Munich massacreThe West German police decided to secretly ambush the Black September members there with snipers, but the plan suffered from poor communication, improper planning and an inadequate number of sharpshooters to eliminate all of the terrorists efficiently.At the airport, the Black September members became aware of their deception and engaged in a fierce gun battle with West German police. Despite premature media reports that the hostages had all been successfully rescued, all of them were ultimately killed in the failed rescue attempt by gunfire or grenades from Black September members.The Black September members were all killed by around 1:30am local time on September 6. However, the tragedy that resulted from the botched rescue attempt was summed up by ABC reporter Jim McKay who was covering the Summer Olympics and hostage crisis: ‘…When I was a kid, my father used to say Our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized. Our worst fears have been realized tonight. They\u0027ve now said that there were eleven hostages. Two were killed in their rooms yesterday morning, nine were killed at the airport tonight. They\u0027re all gone.’          Despite erroneous reports that the hostages were freed, all were killed during the massacreWhat was Black September?Black September was a terrorist organization founded in September 1970 as an offshoot of the Palestinian Liberation Organization.A secular nationalist terrorist group, it notoriously launched a number of other terrorist attacks during its existence in addition to the Munich attack, including assassinating Jordanian Prime Minister Wasfi al-Tal in November 1971 and hijacking Sabena Flight 572 in May 1972 during its flight from Vienna to Lod, Israel.The group was ultimately disbanded by the Palestinian Liberation Organization in September 1973.Inception ending explained: Michael Caine reveals what really happened at the endTwitch plans to take on YouTube by broadening its content to expand beyond gamingNational Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday, 15 AugustLuigi\u0027s \u0027death\u0027 in Smash Bros may be hint for single-player campaignEbenezer Cobb Morley honoured by Google Doodle for his 187th birthdayAmazing McDonald\u0027s hack can get you £1.99 Big Mac and fries for lifeWhat happened in the 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre?Could Meghan Markle\u0027s hair reveal when she is pregnant?Aerosmith Las Vegas residency: Dates, tickets and moreWhat is Real Housewives of New York\u0027s Luann de Lesseps\u0027s net worth?Who is Cairo Dwek?

In the 1990s, I started thinking about how children were engaging with gaming and the internet, which were still embryonic. So when I moved back to Edinburgh from London, I set about exploring how digital learning was being used in schools.The more time I spent in schools, the more I saw what children were actually doing. One of those things was museum visits – and it was clear that digital culture was greatly affecting museums too. So I spent a year trailing school parties taking guided tours around the Royal Museums of Scotland. I would secrete myself in a corner with my lights – this was in the days before cordless equipment – and shoot large groups quickly, then in post-production isolate single children. Here, you can see a split reflection of two girls in the vitrine, but only one of them actually looking.The memories you have of going to a museum are not of your classmates, they are of the objects. I remember the children speaking to the guards, often asking them: “Is it alive or is it dead?” They were five or six years old. The guard would hesitate, saying: “Well, it was alive and now it’s dead.” I can relate to that sense of anxiety. Even now at the zoo, if I’m standing too close to the lion enclosure, I feel nervous. It just appears too open, even though you know the animals cannot get out.The vitrines became a really important part of all the images. This one was an amazing display case in a Victorian gallery, with a glass cupola that gave beautiful overhead light. I remember visiting it myself as a child. On the other side of the bears, there was a Bengal tiger. We would line up to sit down on our little padded seats, inches away from this huge creature. Being in such close proximity to something like that was a strange, memorable experience. And that inidual experience is what I wanted to capture: a child engaging with something much larger than itself.These Victorian displays and dioramas were often quite ferocious and bloody, with animals ripping out each other’s gizzards. That kind of containment of emotion or feeling is a gift for a photographer.The children loved the bears and the birds most. There’s another image of an owl swooping on a taxidermied mouse with a little boy looking out to the camera in front of the case. And another of an impossibly huge albatross in a beautiful sculpted case. The images that worked best were those that played with scale: a very small child engaging with a very large object.I was thinking about children’s engagement with the outside world, especially in the face of the rapidly evolving culture of gaming and the screen. When I was that age, the museum was the place where everything important was held. Now with the internet, that is very different. If a child wants to learn about something, they don’t naturally go to the museum. They go online.This gallery no longer exists. Some of the objects have been brought out, cleaned up and displayed elsewhere, freed from the glass cases.

This extraordinary performance, consisting of three books in one – the first originally published in Iceland in 1994, the second in 2001, and the third in 2016 – sets out to entertain, but also to prod the reader towards a stark realisation of human mortality and the games fate plays.Book One takes place during the second world war in an inn in a small German town. A battered stranger called Leo Loewe is discovered lurking in the shadows close to death, and the tavern owners attempt to help. A young maid is entrusted with caring for this starving Jewish fugitive, who is burdened by the weight of history. Leo guards a hat box that contains something very special – our future narrator, just waiting to be born. This baby-to-be is made of clay, and his fantastical birth takes more than 20 years and hinges on several factors, including love and a stolen ring.From the opening pages and through much of a chaotic if playfully executed narrative, the influence of Günter Grass’s The Tin Drum is evident. Sjón has mastered the earlier fabulist’s technique of merging history with high-speed comedy and surreal profundity. With a man made of clay and a bewildered angel struggling to get rid of a symbolic trumpet, there are shades of the Bible as well as Milton. Sjón, an heir of Mikhail Bulgakov and Laurence Sterne, eases literary references into the text as mere suggestions. With the light, fluid touch of Victoria Cribb, a resourceful, often inspired translator who is alert to Sjón’s quick-change vocal register and genre-hopping artistry, the effect is hypnotic. The reader becomes a gleeful collaborator in an extravaganza in which Bosch meets Chagall, with touches of Tarantino.The narrator, Jósef, appears to have been born to suffer. In Book Three, he tells his own story to a geneticist’s researcher in present-day Iceland, but he uses Book Two to recall his father’s experiences. Jósef takes his time and when his female listener protests, impatient with his tendency towards philosophical digression, this is his lofty response: “May I remind you that you are not sufficiently well versed in the history of narrative to start getting uppity. The fact that I am introducing you to the basics of feminist thinking on narrative at this point is not irrelevant.”It proves a key passage, however irritating it seems: the narrator is bewildered by the reality of his own slow gestation, which is part of history itself. Sjón is also instructing the reader, and this authorial awareness of the art of storytelling is evident throughout, not as a flaw but rather as a consolidation of his weirdly cohesive attention to detail. The reader will also require patience.Cast aside chronological logic: Sjón makes the point that in Iceland people prefer fantasy over facts as the best way to confront reality. His wild, subversive imagination is among his great strengths, not only in CoDex 1962 but throughout his work, most notably in his beautiful novella The Blue Fox, published in Cribb’s immaculate translation in 2008.Late in the narrative there is a cautionary announcement: “Authors are as much in thrall as readers … Little do they suspect that most of what they consider new and innovative in their works is actually so old that millennia have passed since the idea first took shape in the mind of a female storyteller … and with every retelling and garbling, misunderstanding and conflation, mankind’s world of songs and stories expands.”Sjón is celebrating story while commemorating the brief lives of many of those born in the same year as him, 1962, yet fated to early deaths through disease, chance accidents and other horrors. In a sombre recurring device, he includes random lists of the dead, reminders of life’s fragility inserted into a lively picaresque about a difficult birth that makes that of Frankenstein’s monster appear straightforward. This wayward, exciting odyssey confronts death throughout. Nothing is quite what it seems, and there are no easy answers. Here, instead, is an artist preoccupied with questions.• Eileen Battersby’s Teethmarks on My Tongue is published by Apollo.

Or maybe you have an 18-year-old of your own, in which case you will have woken, ashen, from a night plagued by terrors, a clan of hyenas – internationally recognised metaphor for the forces of marketisation – attacking your baby, while you are powerless to help because you’re trying on shoes.It was a useful frame politically: by 2010 it fed into the overall austerity bilge that everything had simply got worse “because liberals” it portrayed teachers as self-interested, working against the long-term interests of students, thus undermining their legitimacy when they said things like: “We can’t teach this new syllabus because we can’t afford the new textbooks” and it had a fix – make exams harder – which looked easy, so long as you didn’t give any thought to what that might entail. Underlying it was this (unintoxicating) cocktail of observable counterpoints: kids did seem to be working harder. They seemed to be under considerably more pressure and to take everything a lot more seriously. They seemed to reach university with a significant anxiety burden. It was all so complicated who could say what caused what? They might simply be anxious about debt, or body image. There was no satisfying clunk of a reality totally at odds with an accepted truth instead, a lot of fine distinctions and blurred causalities.But what a cruel thing we have done to 18-year-olds, caught in this vice of politics’s making, under unendurable pressure to be the best at everything, then called flakes and lightweights when they get three As because so has everyone else. Today should be turned into one of Labour’s new bank holidays and rechristened Intergenerational Solidarity Day. We could all skip work to call LBC and tell them how we felt in 1991, how we failed and still turned out OK, how we had to smoke 20 fags before we even opened the envelope and that the legacy in lifelong nicotine intake has probably been more significant than anything we know about Charles I. Would an 18-year-old take any solace from that? Probably not. They’d probably mutter: “It wasn’t the same for you, old-timer, you were allowed to get a C without being permanently ejected from the society of the right-thinking.” But it would remind us all to stop being such jerks, and that would help.Feminism is ided into waves, first to fourth. It would be more useful to ide feminists by attitude, since doing it chronologically carries the unfortunate connotation that everyone the same age thinks the same thing. Here, Madonna – encompassing every strand of feminism with her sheer refusal to lock into one position – can be our guide.First wavers took their fight to the world arguably, they were just prioritising. There would have been very little point establishing whether men were more or less useful than a bicycle was to a fish before you had a chance to vote on it. You’d think their Madonna era would be late stage – Rebel Heart, the point at which love and revolution meet – but in fact it’s True Blue: they were, above all, practical and literal. You couldn’t smash things up without smashing things up. And you don’t make a pop sensation without making pop.Second wavers were “screw you, I don’t have to be the woman you want a woman to be”, which is not – as you might think – the pointy-bra era (that was ludic and sexual, see “fourth wave”, below) but the Ray of Light phase (“You think it’s time I shuffled off? Not gonna”). The third wave was slightly indolent, can’t-we-all-agree? feminism, and this is American Life Madonna, one minute dressed as Che Guevara, the next snogging Britney a sloping, devilish, “aren’t women and men the same, really? Aren’t communists just capitalists in better hats?” The fourth wave – pro-sex, pro-sex-worker, pro-fluidity, pro-inclusiveness – that’s Like a PrayerErotica Madonna.You will be wondering why this exercise is useful it is possible, indeed necessary, to respect and admire all the Madonnas, without betraying any of the other Madonnas. The same spirit of love and celebration would make the isions of feminism more enjoyable to air and easier to resolve.I arrived at my stepmother-in-law’s house to find it stacked with certificates, highly decorative, some embossed, a pile on every surface. It looked like she had robbed a 19th-century bank, but in fact she’d just cleaned up at the country fair literally won everything. Two separate firsts for dahlias different categories for beetroots, parsnips and overall roots (she won them all) an opaque class called “my favourite cake” (did it mean you liked it more than everyone else liked theirs? Or that it was everyone’s favourite? Never mind, she won). She scored second for a courgette that was “completely out of control, really more of a marrow”.

What once was a last chance saloon for students who didn’t get the grades is increasingly about offering students the chance to reassess. Have they chosen the right course at the right place to spend three to four years of their life? It can’t hurt to shop around for a better fit. Clearing officially starts on A-level results day, 16 August, although many universities will have already been advertising their vacancies and registering student applications from July. Thousands of universities will be looking to fill vacancies on courses that haven’t yet been filled, and will hand out offers with a fixed acceptance window – normally a day or two – to the first students they hear from who meet their requirements. Naturally, the most popular courses and the most prestigious universities tend to run out of places first – some as soon as the phone lines open on the day itself.Clearing is part of the\u0026nbspUcas\u0026nbspadmissions process matching students with unfilled places at universities and colleges.But there are plenty of options available this year, so even students holding a firm offer and feeling confident about their grades may be looking around. “When it came to initially choosing my firm and insurance offers on Ucas, I rushed,” says Katherine McLaughlin, who went through clearing last year despite hitting her grades. “I was swayed by other people’s opinions and the fact the university offered reduced grade boundaries if you chose it as your firm. Almost instantly, I knew I had made a mistake.”McLaughlin is now headed into her second year of criminology and social policy at Loughborough University. She needed the extra time between accepting her Ucas offers and clearing to realise that she didn’t want to study in a big city, and would rather be in a student town near big cities and Loughborough fitted the bill.But while clearing definitely offers a second chance, it’s important to start the day prepared – especially if you have an idea what you want. Emma Leech, director of marketing and advancement at Loughborough, points out that students accepted through clearing have higher dropout rates, possibly because they’ve rushed into making a choice or been influenced by non-essential factors. She adds that the clearing process will be better supported than ever this year. “We’re going to see phone lines opening earlier and earlier, more staff in call centres, lots more focus on other methods of getting in touch, and a big push in advance of clearing.”Bear in mind that clearing in 2018 won’t just be about students competing for places universities will also be competing for students. Leech warns there may be some “unethical practices” as a result, with offers of laptops, tablets and bus travel passes dangled in front of students. “Don’t go for shortcuts and things that glitter it’s student experience, outcomes, academic quality and provision that matter,” she adds.Olivia Capocci knew her A-levels hadn’t gone well enough to secure her law place, but one 10-minute call turned her fortunes around. Interview by Lucy Tobin“Results day at school felt like a surreal scene in a Hollywood film,” says 19-year-old Olivia Capocci. “Everyone who’d done well was outside jumping up and down, taking selfies and celebrating – and anyone who was disappointed, like me, was inside with parents and teachers. There were a few shocked faces, but most of us were trying hard to work out exactly what to do next.”Capocci, who’s from Gosforth in Newcastle upon Tyne, opened her A-level results envelope in the car outside school. “I got really stressed during exams and knew I hadn’t got the three As I needed for my offer to study law at the University of York. I didn’t want to find that out in front of everyone.” She had Bs in English literature and biology, and a C in chemistry, which meant she’d also missed out on her ABB insurance offer at the University of Liverpool.“I was a bit panicked because I’d worked my socks off – and when I phoned York, they immediately said no. The Liverpool phoneline was engaged, so I went into school to start tackling clearing.”Some groundwork ahead of results day helped. “Since I’d known my exams did not go to plan, I’d come up with a list of possible clearing options based on the ’s university league tables. Having that list helped calm my nerves.”She quickly scooped an offer to read law at Northumbria, but didn’t like the idea of staying in Newcastle for university. Then she finally got through to Liverpool’s clearing hotline. “They were fantastic on the phone, really calm and friendly, which was such a relief. The call only lasted 10 minutes, but at the end I was offered a place to study English literature.”It was a subject Capocci had been thinking of studying instead of law at the beginning of sixth form. “So I was over the moon – especially as the course allowed me to study law as a subsidiary in my first year, meaning I could still get a taste for the subject I’d originally picked to study.”Not everything was organised so quickly. “It took several stressful days to sort accommodation, but eventually I managed to get into one of the popular first-year halls,” Capocci adds. “Now I’ve settled in really well. I love the city, I’m really enjoying the course and I’m rowing too, training six days a week and travelling around the country for competitions.”To others facing clearing this year, Olivia advises: “Be flexible about your choice of subject - and city - and have back-up ideas if the grades don’t all go to plan.“Slipping a grade or two is not the end of the world – even if that’s how it feels when you’re staring at A-level results that you didn’t want to see. Clearing can be great – I couldn’t be happier with how mine turned out.”Danelle Cuffie’s A-level grades were lower than expected, but she landed a psychology place at the University of Bedfordshire through clearing. Now in her final year, she’s predicted a first After my results (DEE), I felt so disappointed I spent the first half of the day out shopping. My parents were comforting and supportive, though, and I knew that even if I hadn’t done well, I still had the academic ability to do a degree. I was still set on studying to become a psychologist, and I’d put a lot of pressure on myself to go on to higher education.I started ringing up other universities. I’d signed up for an email service from Ucas, which is how I heard Bedfordshire had places in psychology. It all happened quickly – I rang and spoke to an academic coordinator who was really welcoming. They asked me my English and maths GCSE grades – which were good – and then they made me an offer. I really liked the sound of the teaching style, and the course has exceeded my expectations. I’m planning to do a doctorate in educational psychology in 2019 – so I’ve still got a bit more studying to go.Failing to get my grades is the most valuable experience I’ve ever had. If you fall flat on your face, you can still pull yourself up – I’ve not allowed it to hold me back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5c3aba3bafc3f8bd0aa9ce755f73865e48c189e/0_124_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec9fa5b919e5080ac02cdff5be8b48ef","title":"a level results day 2018 students await results exams grades tougher courses","story":"Jittery teenagers find out their A-level exam results, amid concerns over the impact of new courses.

Here are the fruits of their labours.A-level results day is a cruel trick played on students, according to our columnist, Zoe Williams, who warns that we put youngsters under tremendous pressure yet still claim their grades are being devalued. It’s time we showed solidarity, she says in her latest oeuvre this morning. It’s A-level results day.

It also shows that 353,960 UK students have been accepted on to courses, down two per cent.The drops come in the wake of a drop in applications to start degrees at UK universities this autumn, fuelled by factors including a fall in the UK’s 18-year-old population. Mark Herbert, director of schools and skills at the British Council, called the continuing decline in the number of pupils taking a modern language “a real concern”. He added: Against this overall downward trend, the increasing popularity of Chinese proves that our young people can be enthused to study languages. Our research shows that Mandarin will be one of the most important languages for the UK’s future prosperity and global standing – but we mustn’t neglect Spanish, French and German which will still be vital post-Brexit.Learning a foreign language doesn’t just boost job prospects by providing vital skills that employers are looking for, it also helps us understand other cultures and work internationally. We all need to encourage our young people to see the value of languages and embrace them as important subjects to study at A-level and beyond.The Department for Education has paid tribute to the “next generation of young people succeeding to gain the skills Britain needs”, in a statement pointing out that the university entry rate is the highest ever - and insisting that the reformed A-levels are “better preparing students for studying at university or the workplace”.Civil service media specialists have picked out the statistics they would like us to pay attention to, which include: Damian Hinds, the secretary of state for education, said:We’ve worked to improve education for every child – from their early years through to secondary school and beyond. I also want young people to have wider choice, whether that’s going to university, earning through an apprenticeship or in future taking technical qualifications that match the best in the world.Today is a significant milestone in the lives of many young people. No matter what path they choose to take next, we are working to make sure it provides them with a world-class education and a passport to an exciting future.Here are some key figures in this year’s A-level results, which have been picked out for us by the Press Association: The proportion of students in England gaining C grades or above in A-levels fell back this year, driven by a relatively weaker performance among girls as schools and students continue to grapple with the introduction of new, more intensive exams.The changes dragged down the overall UK pass rates, as the results in England contrasted with better performances in Wales and Northern Ireland, as more than half a million students across the three nations received their A-level results.Stormzy has said he hopes that a scholarship he is offering to help black Cambridge University students pay their tuition fees serves as a reminder to young people from all backgrounds that they have the opportunity to get the best education. The grime artist was speaking at Harris City Academy Crystal Palace in south London, where A-level students are opening their results. The Stormzy scholarship will pay for tuition fees and provide a maintenance grant for up to four years of an undergraduate course, BBC Newsbeat reported. The rapper said: “If you’re academically brilliant don’t think because you come from a certain community that studying at one of the highest education institutions in the world isn’t possible.”Stormzy’s scholarship will fund two students starting this year, and two more in 2019. We’d like to hear how A-level results day has been for you. Have reforms meant you’ve missed out on the university of your dreams, or were you pleasantly surprised?

But looking further ahead, only half of school leavers feel optimistic about finding a job they love, according to a poll.Among other findings: You won’t be surprised to hear that Chris Daly, chief executive of CIM, recommends that these youngsters try their hand at a job in his industry. He said: It’s worrying that so many young people feel pessimistic about the job market - and that in many cases, what they are most concerned about is having the right skills or qualifications to find a job they love.Across all professions, access to training should be a business requirement rather than a nice-to-have.Marketing is a good example of a sector that has clear training and progression opportunities, not only for those looking to enter the job market for the first time, but at every stage to help support learning and development.Despite speculation that boys might do comparatively better this year, thanks to the reformed A-levels’ emphasis on final exams, it’s still the girls who are hogging the limelight with clean sweeps of top grades. In this video from Manchester we see a trio of high achievers from Rochdale sixth form college getting their grades. Here are the first choreographed results day celebration pictures, just in from Brighton College, a public school in East Sussex. As you can see, the ladies in Brighton apparently have much to celebrate - and one would hope so after an education costing an eye-watering £13,190 a term for full-boarding home and EU students!Exams are not even out yet, but there will doubtless be some young among you who are expecting to have failed to meet the demands of your conditional university offers.So what do you do if you haven’t got the grades? You could start by taking a look at this clearing guide produced by the University of Sussex (my alma mater, incidentally).Read more on the University of Sussex website.The education secretary, Damian Hinds, has defended the government’s A-level course reforms - sort of. “There’s a lot more to education, a lot more to achievement than exams alone,” Hinds told the Today programme on Radio 4 - in comments that will perhaps have little resonance with those awaiting their results this morning. “Exams do play an important role of course in recording students achievements, their abilities and help them to move on to the next stage.” As we’ve seen, students and teachers have roundly criticised the reformed courses - which now make up two-thirds of A-level curricula - as placing too much pressure on students to perform in their final exam, and for including too much new material with too little support. But Hinds backed the changes.With A-level reform we worked very closely with universities to make sure that in redesigning them they were made more appropriate, better preparing young people to moving on to the next stage, which of course for very many of them will be going on to university.Having exams at the end of the two years means that it is possible to consider the subject as a whole, to bring all the different parts of it, to synthesise all the different parts of the subject in a way which is a little closer actually to undergraduate study.Hinds also addressed the issue of unconditional offers, which have seen a big rise in numbers this year, prompting some observers to warn that students holding one could take their feet of the gas when it came to studying for their A-level exams.  Unconditional offers have always been in the system, and they have a legitimate role to play in some subjects - in art, for example, where it’s very commonplace to use unconditional offers. ]But there has been this very sharp growth and, yeah, I’m concerned about that. Whenever you see an uptick statistic like that, that’s something that needs attention. The office for students is looking at this and they will come back with their findings and recommendations. My concern is if - and the extent to which - unconditional offers might erode the entry requirements and therefore the confidence in the system. Young people are becoming more sceptical about the benefits of going to university, despite a large majority saying they want to carry on to higher education, research suggests.The findings coincide with the publication on Thursday of A-level and BTec level three grades for hundreds of thousands of sixth formers. University admissions offices were braced for a flood of enquiries after more than 600,000 candidates applied though the Ucas process this year.Thanks to a rapid expansion in the number of university places available in recent years and a slight fall in the number of applicants overall, a significant number of courses still have places available. More than 26,000 places are on offer through the clearing system at universities in England alone, including some belonging to the Russell group of leading research institutions, according to the Press Association.The new research, carried out by Ipsos Mori for the Sutton Trust, polled 2,300 English and Welsh pupils aged 11 to 16.One of this summer’s big exam controversies was the leak of an A-level maths paper. Five students were disqualified and a further 30 are being investigated by the exam board Edexcel over the leak in June - just before students sat the paper.Pearson UK, owner of Edexcel, has alleged that one person was the source of the leaked paper, which was offered for sale to students through two social media applications. Students reported seeing the paper for sale at £200, with sellers said to be offering the first question for free to prove they had it.A police investigation was launched, and the exam board conducted its own inquiry, which identified “identified one inidual as the source of the breach, who has been debarred from any involvement with Pearson examinations for life”.In an update to schools and colleges on Monday, Derek Richardson, the vice president and senior responsible officer at Pearson UK, added: “We have disqualified five students and are currently investigating a further 30 with regards to their involvement.“Their results will be withheld until these investigations are completed. We are continuing to support the police with their ongoing investigation.”A senior headteacher has attacked the pace and quality of the Government’s A-level reforms, arguing that it has put educators under “immense pressure”. Rachael Warwick, executive headteacher of Didcot Girls’ School in Oxfordshire, said the changes were seen as unnecessary by many teachers and the speed at which they had been brought in made them “difficult” to implement. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today that teachers had been left trying to plan courses and writing textbooks before specifications had been finalised, as well as coping with a lack of past papers to guide exam preparations. She said: It has put schools and colleges under immense pressure. Personally I question why that was done and certainly the speed and quality of implementation had a lot to be desired. We would certainly expect in the future a more measured approach to curriculum reform from the Government, and a period of stability.” There will be jittery teenagers - and teachers - throughout the country today as they roll out of bed ahead of getting their A-level results.Almost 290,000 have taken A-levels this year, and gnawing at the pit of many of their stomachs will be worries over whether reforms to subjects have made them tougher or merely “refreshed”, as Ofqual likes to say, “to better prepare students for university”. Twelve subjects have been reformed this year, on top of 13 last year - in total around two-thirds of A-level courses.Many are resentful at being used as guinea pigs for the new qualifications, with claims that increased pressure is taking its toll on students, with fewer resources available covering the new content, as well as teachers, who could find themselves teaching a lesson they’d only taught themselves days earlier. This tweet by Tessa Milligan is the beginning of a thread in which she explains the issues. Ofqual has insisted its “comparable outcomes” process, which links grade proportions to the year-groups’ GCSE results two years’ previously, will ensure there is no distortion in grades. Sally Collier, chief regulator, downplayed the impact of the new curricula. “The new qualifications remain of the same high standard as the ones they replaced and have been updated with input from universities,” she said. “They have more effective assessment arrangements and also allow additional time for study.”Nevertheless, the exam overhaul is thought likely to benefit boys, who appear to do better under stressful exam environments, compared with than girls, who in the past did better from longer periods of assessment. We will be watching closely to see whether there is a shift in the proportions of top grades awarded.Schools and teachers are also worried about a rise in the numbers of unconditional places offered by universities. According to Ucas, nearly one in four 18-year-olds applying from England, Wales and Northern Ireland have received an unconditional offer – meaning they can accept an undergraduate place without meeting the A-level or BTech grades predicted by their teachers.There is little understanding of the effect this might have, although a previous Ucas paper suggested students holding unconditional offers may have underperformed against their expected entry grades."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3eeccf8fbd389524020476fdb5f5ade459ac620/0_580_4160_2494/master/4160.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dd5022a65524a73dfc41c4ed4f17672","title":"fat biking cycling on sand","story":"Peter Kimpton finds a bike that’s perfect for riding on the beach and explores the Glamorgan coast near PorthcawlSmooth tarmac to rough, potholed roads, gravel tracks to mountain paths, cyclists encounter good and bad surfaces, but rarely do we ride on sand. Most bikes would get stuck and seize up in seconds. Beaches may be free of traffic, but they are the last place you think of for a bike ride. Yet a fat-bike defies the laws of traction and discomfort, and allows you to explore thousands of miles of coast in a fraction of the time it would take to do so on foot. But where best to try it?Porthcawl, near Bridgend station on the coast between Cardiff and Swansea, is a surprisingly underused and beautiful beach. It’s the nearest lengthy surf beach to London and several other cities, lies near world-class mountain bike trails, is home to the rarest flower in Britain, and was a film location for Lawrence of Arabia. And for one weekend a year, it’s the surreal home to 35,000 Elvis devotees. But here I sought other ways to be all shook up. Porthcawl is ideal for exploring miles of unpopulated coast on two wheels. Hire a fat-bike and feel like you are riding a tractor. With their massive wheels and tyres, you feel you should be wearing a gold chain – they’re the badboy gangster of the big, showy bike family. And for a regular road cyclist, they are also strangely counterintuitive. Tyre pressure is best set low: sometimes as low as 6psi (most road bikes are pumped to at least 80psi), and with very low gearing, the experience is a bit like rolling on a cushiony balloon across all sorts of rough surfaces.This felt strange at first, but once I found a comfortable low gear, apart from stopping on some very steep sections on fine-sand dunes, the rolling resistance on sand and rock really works. Going above 15mph is difficult, but with so much unspoilt coast, it’s a great way to explore. Merthyr Mawr sand dunes, lying just behind the beach, are also known as the South Wales Sahara due to the Lawrence film, and covers a bumpier 800 acres. Going up some of its slopes was less easy, and required a bit of walking, but a treat was in store at the top.Our guide, Corum Champion from Porthcawl Bike Hire, took us up to its highest point, and second highest dune in Europe, known as the Big Dipper, from which you can try a slippery but fun descent:Unless you plan to ride on beaches daily, bike hire (from £10 an hour or £35 for four hours) is the best option, as fat-bikes need regular maintenance to keep their chains and gears clean and oiled. Punctures weren’t a problem. The Fat-bikes’ thick tyres, at least in one afternoon, seem impervious to sharp rocks, shale and pebbles.Gliding along the coast on a variety of surfaces with a sea breeze certainly offers a refreshing alternative to clogged city roads or sharing country roads with cars. If you’re lucky, your guide might help you find specimens of the rare fen orchid. We spotted it.On a fine day, the waves also beckon along Bridgend County and the Glamorgan Heritage Coast, and there are plenty of surfing action to be had in the area. But for the time being I’ll be sticking to two wheels to explore the traffic-free Glamorgan coast and beyond."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72702b16786297d4130317692af41ba2fabd7cd6/0_0_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ea313a8ec4a5e00c03a296caa8bbfaa","title":"chris pine star trek films captain kirk jesse plemons","story":"Risking the cast’s chemistry by hiring a new Captain Kirk may be boldly going way too farThere are moments in USS Callister, the 2017 Black Mirror episode that riffs furiously on Star Trek and gamer geekery, that might tempt us to wonder if the makers of the new series of films (starring Chris Pine as Captain Kirk) might have considered Jesse Plemons for the role instead. For while Pine has charisma in spades and a confident twinkle in the eye that recalls William Shatner at his best, Plemons is rather better at nailing the Canadian actor’s habit of slipping into knowing, smug braggadocio when the Klingons have been defeated for the umpteenth time.Casting the star of Breaking Bad and Fargo as James T might be a little like the makers of James Bond deciding to hire Johnny English’s Rowan Atkinson as the new 007. But far worse casting decisions have been made in the halls of Hollywood over the decades – let’s hope we shouldn’t be girding our loins for another now that Pine has been revealed to be in a pay dispute with Paramount Pictures about his future in Star Trek.The Hollywood Reporter says the Wonder Woman actor has in effect been asked to take a pay cut, owing to the middling performance of 2016’s Star Trek Beyond, which made just $343.5m (£271m) worldwide against a production budget of $185m (which, due to the eternally eccentric accountancy practices of Hollywood studios, means it probably lost money). Also in dispute is Chris Hemsworth, who was expected to reprise his role as George Kirk (James’s dear old supposedly dead dad) in Star Trek IV.The original article states, somewhat bemusingly, that Pine’s comrades on the Starship Enterprise are at least, pretty much to the last member, signed up for the next episode. But Star Trek wouldn’t be Star Trek without Captain Kirk, and there would not be much point in his crewmates setting off on the next stage in their bold adventure into space without him. There are only so many times we can chuckle at Spock’s awkward attempts at romance with Zoe Saldana’s Uhura, or witness Simon Pegg’s Scotty snatching geeky victory from the jaws of defeat.Nor is bringing in another actor to play Kirk really an option here. When Pine pulled on Shatner’s yellow blazer for the first time, in 2009’s Star Trek, it was to mark the reintroduction of the long-running space saga to the big screen in a fresh timeline and new actors taking the key roles. The only returnee from the Original Series cast was the late Leonard Nimoy, in an extended, wonderfully elegant cameo as the time-travelling “Spock Prime”. To now hire a new actor to play Kirk, while keeping all other crew members of the Enterprise in their current roles, would be to risk losing the abundant chemistry between Pine, Karl Urban’s Bones and Zachary Quinto’s Spock. And Star Trek, perhaps more than any other sci-fi series, is all about the chemistry between its key cast members.We have to believe these guys have spent years in each other’s company, through exciting adventures and tedious trawls through the furthest reaches of space alike. The series would almost do better to kill off Kirk and reboot with a new crew, just as it has done umpteen times on the small screen. Hardcore Trekkies would probably cheer such a move, given the distaste many display towards the new films.Paramount may have a point about the budget. The Star Trek movies do not make the kind of money Marvel or Star Wars films routinely pull in at the global box office. But they are well-reviewed action tentpoles that most studios would be desperate to have on their slate. The danger here is that the current impasse ends up proving a false economy for the bigwigs – an unwinnable battle as ultimately self-defeating as the saga’s famous Kobayashi Maru test. The Enterprise might well eventually continue its famous five-year mission, after her destruction and bravura climactic reconstruction in Beyond. But without her captain to guide her, will she ever fly so true again?The sidelining of Plemons’ horrid Captain Robert Daly in USS Callister was the catalyst for his captive crewmates’ escape into a wider digital universe of geeky sci-fi adventure in the Netflix series. Deposing Pine from the Star Trek hot seat seems highly unlikely to deliver the same rewards.

No one took us out from school and marched us about to say ‘this happened here’, which is remarkable.”Manchester Histories, a charity, is leading the campaign for Peterloo to be taught in all schools. It has applied for money from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help schools teach about the attack, and it is developing a dedicated website and walking app on the subject and training a cohort of volunteers to become “Peterloo ninjas”.There is no explicit mention of Peterloo on the national curriculum, though the Department for Education said teachers were free to teach it if they wanted.Leigh said he saw parallels between England then and the country of today. “In the end, why is the film still relevant? Many reasons. One of them being the difference between those who have and those who don’t have. Those who have power and those who don’t. Those who have wealth and those who are on the breadline.”At the time of the massacre, the London-based government was ignorant of life outside the capital, said Leigh. The then home secretary, Henry Addington, who oversaw the ruthless crackdown on dissent that reached its bloody nadir at Peterloo, had never been to the north, Leigh discovered during his four years of research.The government saw those agitating in the north as “terrorists who had to be put down”, said Leigh. “But we know that these were people with a legitimate cause. Some of them were moderate and some of them more extreme.”The biggest problem Leigh had when shooting the £14m film was that Manchester had changed so much in the two centuries since Peterloo.“When we embarked on it, I said obviously we are going to shoot it in Manchester. Well, not a single frame of it is filmed in Manchester,” said Leigh, who shot the massacre scenes in Tilbury, Essex.The site of the battle is now unrecognisable, occupied by tooting trams, Manchester’s central library and the Midland hotel.Though Peterloo was filmed outside of the city, Manchester is to host its UK premiere, after the BFI London film festival decided to show a competition film outside of the capital for the first time in its 62-year history.•Peterloo screens on 17 October at Manchester’s Home, followed by a Q\u0026ampA with the director and cast that will be simulcast to cinemas around the UK. It goes on general release on 2 November.

This richly compassionate, fiercely acted and beautifully shot period drama is about the second conflict, the battle of wills on the home front, as these women struggle to maintain a family farm in the Deux-Sèvres region of western France.A way of life with its Hardyesque seasonal rhythms of sowing and reaping is minutely, sumptuously depicted. But all the time in the background – in the letters home, in the muttered hints of the grim-faced men on leave and their shellshocked dreams – is the horror of war. Those seasonal rhythms come to include regular visits from officials with telegrams.s is directed by Xavier Beauvois, terrifically shot by cinematographer Caroline Champetier and adapted by Beauvois, Frédérique Moreau and the film’s editor Marie-Julie Maille from the 1924 novel by Ernest Pérochon, the teacher, Goncourt-winning author and first world war veteran who in 1940 refused to collaborate with the Vichy regime, saw his books banned and finally died of a heart attack, brought on by the stress of daily Gestapo harassment.Nathalie Baye gives a performance of effortless authority as the widowed Madame Hortense, the matriarch who must impose her will on the running of the farm. Her daughter Solange (played by Baye’s real-life daughter Laura Smet) is her most important worker, given that her father-in-law Henri (played by non-professional Gilbert Bonneau) is too elderly to do much. Smet plays Solange as a passionate woman who like her mother has accepted the patriotic duty of reining in her emotions. Her husband Clovis (Olivier Rabourdin) comes home from the front, angry at the hypocrisy and cruelty of war. The Germans, he tells them all, are just like them: workers, husbands, fathers.This is not quite what Solange’s enlisted brothers have to say on their own visits home. Constant (Nicolas Giraud) is a decorated officer, a teacher in civilian life who on an appearance in the classroom listens with faintly pained reserve to his pupils eagerly reciting in his honour a poem attacking the “Boches” (Krauts). Most importantly, there is Georges (Cyril Descours), who is perhaps his mother’s favourite: she comes alive in his presence as she does not with Constant, and it is Georges’s longed-for visits that put into motion the film’s tragedy.Hortense has just hired a new worker, Francine, played by newcomer Iris Bry, who instantly impresses with her hard work and cheerful attitude. Georges himself is clearly smitten with the pretty, charming Francine they agree to write to each other when he returns to the front, and watchful Hortense is not displeased with this turn of events. She can imagine this young woman as a permanent addition to the household and even as a daughter-in-law. But Francine is an outsider, and the courtship enrages Marguerite (Mathilde Viseux) a longtime intimate of the family who had regarded herself as his intended. And then the Americans turn up: swaggeringly handsome young soldiers who are the source of terrible sexual tension and cause Hortense to make a terrible mistake. Francine is to become a living victim of war.The beauty and the pathos of the film are vivid in every frame. Most unbearable is the shot in which Constant says his farewells before returning to the war and walks away from the farm up a shady country lane that leads back to the station: he turns and waves, framed by the trees, his brave, open face lit by a heartbreakingly good-natured smile. The terrible omen is obvious.Then there is the remarkable scene in which Georges takes Francine into the forest, which is part of the family’s estate – a magical place made even more mysterious by the standing stones there, which, incidentally, are a further reminder of Tess of the D’Urbervilles and Stonehenge. The stones’ presence imbues that whole place with something profoundly moving and erotic, and the woodland itself consecrates the love between Georges and Francine.The years are flashed up on screen as the time goes by: the harrowingly important years of 1914 and 1918, but then, without any great fanfare, we get 1919 and 1920. There is no war’s-over scene with dancing in the streets – or farmyard. Hardscrabble life goes on, as it went on before the war, and the widowed Hortense was in any case used to running things without a husband. Beauvois concludes the film with an affecting, melancholy song. It is the music of regret and acceptance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3607a3fd1a0cbecf18d50255e4f831fe0f7ef09/827_1139_3955_2373/master/3955.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb5219a9802731e7094a89e8e48d3ce","title":"chelsea technical director priority","story":"• Club finally switch focus to replacing Michael Emenalo• Dan Ashworth, Monchi and Michael Ballack among targetsChelsea finally hope to make progress on the appointment of a new technical director to succeed the departed Michael Emenalo once the transfer window closes across Europe at the end of the month.Emenalo left his position last November and subsequently took up a similar role at Monaco in Ligue 1, with the director Marina Granovskaia taking on his major responsibilities at Stamford Bridge. She has overseen the club’s incoming and outgoing transfers in the two windows since, including sanctioning the latest wave of loan departures this summer, with the search for a permanent successor put on hold.Chelsea opted to prioritise the appointment of a new head coach, with Maurizio Sarri eventually replacing Antonio Conte in mid-July, and efforts to strengthen the first-team squad rather than securing a technical director. Yet while further players are expected to leave this month to add to the 31 loanees who have departed to date – Kenneth Omeruo joined Leganés on Wednesday – Granovskaia is expected to turn her attentions back to filling the role once the European and Football League loan window deadline has passed.Sarri is understood to be eager to work closely with whoever takes up the position, meaning a candidate who speaks Italian could be favoured and would act as a go-between between the academy, first-team and hierarchy. Yet Granovskaia has still to finalise whether the appointment would be a like-for-like replacement for Emenalo, or whether duties could be shared among existing members of staff. She is likely to seek to continue to oversee transfer dealings and contract negotiations at the club.The likes of Dan Ashworth, currently technical director at the Football Association, and the former Chelsea players Juliano Belletti and Michael Ballack have been mentioned, together with Monchi, the director of football at Roma.

Even though Pep Guardiola has more squad depth than most, the midfielder’s absence caused comment and his creative input was missed, which is probably why he was sent on for the last half-hour.City have players who can do a similar job, most notably David Silva and Ilkay Gündogan, though De Bruyne is the player who brings the best out of his teammates and an absence of more than a few weeks would adversely affect their title defence.“Kevin is a great player and it’s just unfortunate that it’s happened to him in training but there’s more than enough depth in the squad,” said the defender Kyle Walker. “We don’t just rely on one player. It’s a team game and whoever steps in will do well. Obviously it’s a big loss but we’ve got more than enough cover.”So influential was De Bruyne in City’s title campaign last season that he would most likely have been voted player of the season but for Mohamed Salah’s remarkable run of goals and performances that helped to carry Liverpool into the Champions League final.With the transfer window already closed, losing their most gifted and versatile attacking performer for any length of time would be a blow to Guardiola and his team, though even if it were still possible to bring in a replacement City would have struggled to identify a player of the requisite quality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5095e4b5007b6895a4ee62b058142963c0bba84/0_81_2543_1525/master/2543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f347c79fbe867d36f2f6d6436e823a2e","title":"mesut ozil racism claims nonsense toni kroos","story":"Toni Kroos has criticised former Germany teammate Mesut Özil for the way he announced his international retirement over claims of racism, which the Real Madrid midfielder called “nonsense”.The 29-year-old Özil announced he would no longer be playing for the national in July after Germany crashed out of the World Cup group stage. He said he had faced “racism and disrespect” because of his Turkish roots.“Basically Mesut is a deserved international and as a player he deserved a better departure,” Kroos told Bild newspaper in an interview published on Thursday. “But the way he resigned was not in order.”Özil was a key member of Germany’s World Cup-winning side in 2014 and was voted by fans as the team’s player of the year five times since 2011. But the Arsenal midfielder faced a barrage of criticism at home for having his photograph taken with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in May and for his performances at the World Cup in Russia.In his resignation statement last month, Özil also accused the German Football Association of failing to back him in the row over the photo. German fans jeered him and Ilkay Gündoğan, a team mate also of Turkish descent who posed with Erdoğan as well, during World Cup warm-up games in May.“The parts in his statement that are rightly addressed are unfortunately overshadowed by the significantly higher amount of nonsense,” Kroos said. “I think he knows very well that racism within the national team and the DFB does not exist.”Germany’s surprise elimination from the World Cup was their earliest exit from the tournament in 80 years, and Özil was one of the scapegoats for their unsuccessful title defence.The 28-year-old Kroos, who has won the last three Champions League titles with Real Madrid, said he had no plans to follow Özil into international retirement after their World Cup flop.“I will continue towards Euro 2020 and have set myself the goal of being far more successful there than in the recent past,” Kroos said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3949bba4c0a0dac09767b5cc818d2b2ea48c9dd6/0_52_2147_1288/master/2147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3a5358aa29ccc3cdfe12f5d4e372463","title":"not weekend for premier league underdog football weekly","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Archie Rhind-Tutt and Mark Langdon to review the first Premier League weekend of the season, Liverpool’s impressive start, same old Arsenal (or is it?), Luke Shaw’s release from wherever José Mourinho was hiding him and a foul from BurundiRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Le Coq Arena in Tallinn.With the La Liga season set to start at the weekend, playing 120 minutes in a venue located more than 2,400 miles from the Spanish capital was not ideal for either club.Real’s new manager, Julen Lopetegui, endured a nightmare start as the European champions fell behind inside a minute to a superb inidual goal from Costa. The Spain striker chased his own flick on following Diego Godín’s ball forward, held off the challenges of Ramos and Raphaël Varane and then smashed the ball past Keylor Navas at the near post from a tight angle.Navas should have done better and he probably would not have started the match had the new £31.5m signing Thibaut Courtois, who was watching from the stands, been registered to play.Having not signed a replacement for Ronaldo, Lopetegui opted to select Gareth Bale in a three-pronged attack with Benzema and Marco Asensio. Bale, who scored the match-winning goals in May’s Champions League final as a substitute, created the leveller in the 27th minute. The Wales forward burst down the right past Lucas Hernández and delivered a perfect cross for Benzema to head past Jan Oblak at the far post.The Atlético coach, Diego Simeone, was forced to watch from the stands while serving the third match of a four-game touchline ban after insulting a match official during last season’s Europa League semi-final against Arsenal. He withdrew the World Cup winner Antoine Griezmann with 57 minutes played and saw his team fall behind six minutes later.Juanfran, under pressure from Benzema, was penalised for handball by the Polish referee Szymon Marciniak and Ramos coolly converted the resultant spot-kick, rolling the ball into the bottom right corner and sending Oblak the wrong way.Atlético had never previously beaten their city rivals in a final but they responded with an equaliser 11 minutes from time. Juanfran atoned for his earlier error by playing in Griezmann’s replacement Ángel Correa and the substitute cut the ball back for Costa to tap home.Saúl put Atlético back in front eight minutes into the additional period, smashing a volley into the top right corner following a cross from the substitute Thomas Partey.Real never conceded four goals in a match under Lopetegui’s predecessor Zinedine Zidane and were aiming to win the trophy for the third successive season. But any hopes of a fightback were extinguished in the 104th minute when midfielder Koke slotted home for the Europa League holders to give Simeone his seventh trophy as Atlético manager."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42bd42a27674995a5a2aa4d5dc1d7887136a0661/0_183_5108_3067/master/5108.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e561028e3a8a876143b08b81cb72a331","title":"is clearing leaving students feeling anxious and isolated","story":"Getting a university place through clearing is now mainstream – but the transition to an unexpected institution can be difficultWhen Freya Marshall-Payne checked her A-level results four years ago, she felt crushing disappointment. She had slipped a grade in one subject, jeopardising her place to read history at Oxford. “I completely lost the sense I had of a future,” she says.Marshall-Payne entered clearing rather than take a place at her second-choice university. “It was a stab in the dark,” she says. “I think going into clearing was to escape that devastation.”Ringing clearing hotlines was stressful, but it was only when she arrived at her new university, Sussex, that she recognised how difficult the whole experience had been. Readjusting to a new, unexpected city combined with feelings of failure left her with anxiety and depression.She thinks that if her entry through clearing had been flagged to her academic tutor, it might have opened a conversation about whether she needed extra support from the outset. “I only wish I had got myself on a waiting list for therapy as soon as I arrived at university,” she says.Marshall-Payne’s experience matters because clearing is now a mainstream route into university. In 2017, 67,000 students entered university through clearing, and this year the number looks set to be higher. Growing demand for clearing has helped reduce stigma, not least because for many students it’s no longer about failure. Some have changed their minds, others are applying for the first time or are trading up after getting higher grades.But many applicants have, like Marshall-Payne,  missed their grades. Student Minds, a mental health charity, has done research into how this affects their university experience. “We know from students we’ve spoken to that it can be a disappointing time,” says policy manager Rachel Piper. “Your expectations can be let down, so it’s important to have time to readjust to the new offer you’ve received.”Supporting students through the transition from school to university is a priority for the new regulator, the Office for Students. Piper believes universities can help students through clearing by normalising the experience – starting with communicating how many other students arrived through the same route. Universities should also ensure these students have the same information as other students, and are invited into social groups before the start of term.And while many universities guarantee accommodation to all students, others will have assigned most rooms to first-choice students. “Having worse-quality accommodation because of clearing can really impact on someone’s sense of belonging and wellbeing during their time at university,” Piper says.This year, Salford University has introduced a clearing support team in response to the deluge of calls it received from its newest recruits last year. Most of these related to accommodation, which the university doesn’t guarantee, although the team will signpost longer-term support services.Other universities are more focused on streamlining their results-day services. Christina Edgar, director of student recruitment at Sheffield University, says her focus is on ensuring “responsible recruitment” so students don’t feel pressured into picking the wrong institution by persuasive call centre staff.The Access Project, a charity, is campaigning for more support for A-level students on results day. According to Lucy Ball, a programme director, students are forced to make decisions in a “hyper-emotional state”, often with limited help from inexperienced teachers and parents.To reduce students’ anxiety, the Access Project is running clearing preparation workshops in schools across the country. Ideally, though, Ball thinks there should be a two-day window between results day and the opening of clearing to give students time to think about their options.In the meantime, there are several things universities can do, she suggests. They can help schools by giving them clearer guidance on how to prepare students, and ensuring the staffing of helplines is adequate. Transparency around the profiles of students for whom universities will drop grades is helpful, too.There’s also evidence to suggest that students who enter university through clearing are more likely to drop out. “Clearing students may be more at risk if they haven’t thought through their decision or taken the time to check out the university they accept before they arrive,” says Emma Leech, director of marketing at Loughborough University.Loughborough tries to address this through social media campaigns signposting mental health and academic support that are sent to all students, to avoid those who’ve come in through clearing feeling singled out. This year, it has introduced one-to-one follow-up for students coming through clearing if they want it.Kam Gill, an academic at Coventry University, is researching how to curb drop-out rates. He has developed a scoring matrix based on student self-evaluation that can identify the students most at risk of dropping out. The two key personality traits are efficacy, meaning tenacity, and self-esteem.“In terms of clearing students, it’s a difficult one because you can have two types,” he explains. “You can have the ones who have that real high self-esteem about them – I’ve just managed to get through to university by the skin of my teeth, I’m going to make sure I get through. But you can get the other type, who will know getting in through clearing is a risk, and think ‘I might be off by Christmas because I’m not good enough.’”He says this latter category needs to be flagged to the university as quickly as possible, with a personal tutor called in to allay students worries about the daunting prospect of a three or four-year degree. Instead, the tutor can persuade them to approach their degree in bite-sized chunks, like getting through the first term: “They’re looking at the big picture, and I’m looking at the small picture, the day-to-day.”Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

On Wednesday the high court ruled it had misled the businesswoman about its “exclusive” membership.Delivering the ruling, Judge Richard Parkes QC said: “Gertrude Stein quipped that whoever said money can’t buy happiness didn’t know where to shop.“This case is about a woman looking for romantic happiness who says she was tricked into shopping in the wrong place, paying a large sum to a dating agency which, she says, made promises but failed to produce the goods.”Burki, 47, a mother of three who lives in Chelsea, approached the dating service in 2013 in pursuit of a new partner. “Her requirements were not modest,” the judge observed.What she wanted was a “sophisticated gentleman”, ideally employed in the finance industry. It was important that he should lead a “wealthy lifestyle” and be “open to travelling internationally”.Her most important requirement was a willingness to have more children since she had always wanted four. Burki was encouraged by what she read about Seventy Thirty and eventually signed up, paying £12,600.The judge said the agency’s then managing director, Lemarc Thomas, claimed there was a substantial number of wealthy male members actively engaged in its matchmaking services who were a sufficient match for Burki’s desires.This was false and misleading, said the judge, because there were only about 100 active male members altogether. That number could not “by any stretch of the imagination” be described as a substantial number, even without considering how far that number would have to be reduced to allow for compliance with her criteria.“Had Ms Burki known what the true size of the active membership was, she would not have joined Seventy Thirty,” he said. She was induced to enter her contract with the agency by the false representations given by Thomas, who must have known he was giving her a wholly false impression, he added.In her legal action, Burki sought the return of her membership fee and damages for distress. The agency counter-sued her for libel and malicious falsehood in connection with two online reviews she wrote.The judge awarded her £12,600 damages for deceit and £500 for distress. He awarded Seventy Thirty £5,000 for libel relating to an April 2016 Google review by Burki.Ruling on the agency’s libel claim, Parkes said he had not found the business was a fundamentally dishonest or fraudulent operation, although at the time it probably had a short supply of suitable men.Had Thomas explained to Burki that the database included active members, former members who still wished to be matched, and people who had been headhunted and had agreed to be put on the database in the hope of finding a suitable partner, she would have had little cause for complaint, Parkes said. Susie Ambrose, the founder and company director of Seventy Thirty, said Burki had joined with the “lofty and unrealistic” expectations of how many men she would be introduced to through the agency.“We are a niche, exclusive agency, not a mainstream, mass-market online dating service. We are not going to have thousands of members because there simply aren’t thousands of single, wealthy, high-calibre prospects out there,” Ambrose said.She added: “By her own admission in court, Ms Burki never read the terms and conditions … Ms Burki was found to have libelled Seventy Thirty, as the judge said that we had sourced excellent matches for her. Therefore, her remarks about us being a non-reputable and fraudulent company were deemed untrue and entirely without foundation.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d75d81fe664e8271e73047b39660d91748c74c9/0_171_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b364fa2933da2c3f832a421af85a17a","title":"study law to open up a world of opportunities","story":"Politician, lecturer, human rights campaigner – a law degree will set you on the path for a career at the top Not only does a law degree or postgraduate course open up a wide variety of careers within the legal sector – it can also set you up for a future career at the top, in anything from business to politics.International law, for example, is a fascinating and fast-moving area. Mariam Munang took her bar professional training course (BPTC) at the University of Law, and is currently based in New York as an associate legal officer at the United Nations. Munang says that her time at the University of Law – which has 10 centres across the UK – gave her the skills and confidence to get to her current position. “I chose to study there because of its strong emphasis on honing practical legal skills, such as drafting and advocacy,” she says. “I prepare for trial in much the same way as I prepared for mock trials at the University of Law. The BPTC gave me the space and opportunity to make errors, learn from them, and hone my own style.”Baroness Shami Chakrabarti is one of many lawyers who choose to use their skills in the political world. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Law, where she is now a mentor to students. She’s a member of the House of Lords, a politician, a barrister and a former director of human rights group Liberty. “I am proud to be the shadow attorney general in a shadow cabinet of many lawyers and many more colleagues who champion human rights and the rule of law,” she says. “During my time at Liberty, we defeated proposals to lock people up for 42 days without charge, halted ID cards, and won important victories on issues like stop-and-search.”One of the proudest moments of her career, she says, came when the Human Rights Act was passed. “In a sense, there’s no such thing as human rights law, only a whole host of legal and policy areas that engage people’s human rights,” she says. “Human rights are a powerful shield against abuse of power.” Simon Firth, partner at Linklaters LLP and visiting professor, says teaching those at the start of their careers is one of the best aspects of his job. “I love explaining the principles of the subject I am covering,” he says. “The University of Law has a very practical approach to preparing students for legal practice. That means trainees are effective from the moment they start training contracts.” As graduation approaches, the university’s award-winning careers service offers students guidance on achieving ambitions – another step to set them up for success.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan graduated from the University of Law Guildford with Law Society finals, the predecessor to the LPC. “At the University of Law I really valued the support of my fellow students, my lecturers and my tutors,” he says. “They kept my motivation levels up through many long days and late nights of revision.”Khan, who grew up on a south London council estate, was a human rights lawyer before entering politics. In 2016, he won the largest personal mandate in British political history to become mayor of London. His legal background provided vital experience for the world of politics, he says. “I was a member of parliament for my home town in Tooting before becoming the mayor for all Londoners,” he says. “As a human rights lawyer, I defended people who were victims of discrimination and that made me more determined than ever to fight injustice wherever I see it.” Visit the University of Law for more information"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44bdf721559873740312df64f47f9dcb3bec1ada/0_340_5097_3058/master/5097.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3cf4227f019c0ead6143141082a36c2","title":"majority of scottish voters feel ignored by uk ministers on brexit","story":"Support in Scotland for remain has risen since 2016 referendum, poll suggestsAlmost two-thirds of Scottish voters believe the Westminster government is ignoring their concerns during Brexit negotiations, and there is now more support in Scotland for remaining in the EU than at the time of the 2016 referendum, polling suggests.About 600 people are expected to attend a rally in Edinburgh on Saturday in support of another vote on Brexit, as part of a summer of action coordinated by the People’s Vote campaign.Peter Kellner, a polling expert and former president of YouGov, said: “Support for a public vote on the outcome is growing across the UK but is particularly strong in Scotland where most people did not want to leave in the first place. There is deep pessimism about what Brexit will mean for Scotland and the next generation.“But the survey suggests the leaderships of both the SNP and the Labour party are in the wrong place with most of their supporters.

It is in orbit about a star 650 light years from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus, the swan. The ultra hot planet is about 30 times closer to its host star than the Earth is to the sun – and its star is also twice as hot as the sun. As a result, temperatures on Kelt-9b reach 4,000C on the side that faces the star. This is not as hot as our Sun, which is almost 6,000C, but hotter than many stars.Due to its proximity to the star, the planet orbits the star every 36 hours, with the same side always facing inwards. This means there is constant daytime on one side and constant night on the other, creating extreme temperature variations across the planet. The temperature of the night side is probably still about 2,000C, though, Heng suggested.Detailed measurements of the orbit suggest the planet is gaseous, probably mostly hydrogen and possibly with a small solid core. The latest observations, published in Nature, are the first to reveal the composition of the planet’s atmosphere.The team used the Galileo National Telescope in La Palma, Canary Islands, to observe the planet precisely as it was moving in front of its host star. By detecting the tiny fraction of light from the star that filters through the planet’s atmosphere, the astronomers were able to detect components in the atmosphere and show that these included iron vapour and titanium. This is the first time that metals have been spotted on planets beyond the solar system.In future, the same techniques could be used to detect hints of life elsewhere in the Universe.“It doesn’t matter if we’re trying to detect titanium, oxygen or some strange molecule that is indicative of life,” said Heng. “These hot planets are a testing ground for techniques that we will use when the really interesting planets start to show up over the next few years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d5b5bebe2f56d6192559a552b81923d59b3a014/0_71_1406_844/master/1406.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=633dbd877ed0a43fbf4606218401eec6","title":"opt out organ register unlikely increase donations study","story":"Next of kin more likely to veto family member’s presumed consent, researchers sayAn opt-out register is unlikely to increase the number of organ donations because family members would be more likely to veto a presumed consent, researchers have said.The results of a study by Queen Mary University of London suggest that next of kin are more likely to quash a donation if their deceased relative has not given explicit consent.People in England currently have to opt in to donate organs but, amid concerns about a shortage of available organs, the government plans to change to an opt-out system, which presumes consent, from 2020.The government says the move could save as many as 700 lives a year – there were 6,044 people on the waiting list in 2017-18, 411 of whom died – but the study’s authors question this.They say the best system is a two-way register, or mandated choice system, whereby people explicitly state either their wish to donate or their objection to doing so.Dr Magda Osman, the lead researcher, said: “If you automatically presume consent of the entire nation by putting them into an opt-out system, what you do is you artificially inflate the numbers on the register but it doesn’t necessarily translate into more organ donations.Even under the existing opt-in system, many relatives have vetoed organ donation. NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) reported in 2016 that 547 families had vetoed donations since April 2010 despite being informed that their relative had opted in to the register. It said an estimated 1,200 people had missed out on potential life-saving transplants as a result.For the study, published in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied on Thursday, 1,294 adults from the US and Europe were presented with fictional scenarios and asked to ascertain the wishes of the potential donor.The researchers found that regardless of where the participants came from they perceived the donor’s underlying preference to donate as stronger under default opt-in and mandated choice systems (where participants have to express a preference) compared with default opt-out and mandatory donor systems.Osman said the increase in the number of people on the organ register would also be futile if the necessary infrastructure was not in place. There needed to be the hospitals and staff to carry out transplants as well as nurses to work with families of potential donors, she said. An internal NHSBT document has voiced similar concerns.Jackie Doyle-Price, minister for heath inequalities, said: “We believe that by making these changes, we will save and transform hundreds of lives every year.“But organ donation remains a gift ... We know this new system alone will not break down every barrier. We need to address myths and misconceptions around donation, and we will only do this by having informed debate and dialogue, which will be fostered by these proposals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c22690a7831002e93855c4f4cb3c954484a7482f/0_0_3978_2387/master/3978.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d04fd64482e548bbc8a101f5b51c4bed","title":"nokia 8110 4g review nostalgia the matrix banana phone","story":"The original was made famous by The Matrix, and some might want to drop this reboot out of the nearest window tooThe new Nokia 8110 4G is the latest nostalgia trip from HMD Global, but is it more than just a remake of that “banana phone” from the Matrix?HMD had a hit on its hands with the new Nokia 3310 from last year, which was a surprisingly charming dumbphone that cost slightly more than other basic Nokias because of the name.The re-envisioned Nokia 8110 4G goes further, but not necessarily for the better.For those who never had the original 8110 in 1996, it was a curved mobile with a slider, whose primary claim to fame was being dropped out of an office block window by a clumsy Keanu Reeves in the 1999 sci-fi blockbuster.The 2018 version displays only a passing resemblance to the original. Gone is the stubby aerial and small monochrome screen, replaced with a larger, colour screen and shorter slider. The keypad doesn’t look anything like the original, either. You could say that only the name is the same.The curved back comes off to expose the battery, two sim slots and a microSD slot. The manual slider exposes the keypad and unlocks the phone, but doesn’t contain the phone’s microphones so it’s really only there for aesthetic purposes. You can hang up on someone by slamming the slider closed though, so there’s that.The top of the phone has a microUSB socket for charging and a headphone socket for listening to music or the built-in FM radio.The button configuration and menu system is the same as last year’s new 3310. A select button is ringed by a D-pad and flanked by two action keys, a call and a hangupback button.

It looks and behaves like the old series 30, but has things such as an app store, Google Assistant, YouTube, Google Maps, email, a browser and, of course, Snake.Google Assistant works surprisingly well, YouTube works just about, and you can even sync your Google or Outlook contacts, if you can face typing out your password using the numeric pad, which took me the best part of 10 minutes.Google Maps is slow but usable too, while the browser can just about handle sites like the .Despite having an app store, there’s no WhatsApp (although apparently it’s coming), Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, Instagram, Uber or Spotify. There is Twitter though, if you can bear it.Bashing out messages is about as tedious as you can expect using the cramped T9 keypad, but it can be done, which is pretty much the experience of the whole phone – most things can be done with enough patience.The phone comes with 4GB of storage, which is ided into 2GB for apps and 2GB for media, such as photos and music, if you want to sideload it on there. You can also insert a microSD card for more storage if you really need it.Battery life is about four to five days with my heavy usage, or 25 days of 4G standby according to HMD.It has one, it is two megapixels and it works, but don’t expect miracles. It’ll do in a pinch, but it won’t match even the worst cameras from a modern smartphone. It records video too, but there’s no selfie camera, so you’ll have to do the old flip-round and hope for the best.With the Nokia 8110 4G HMD has produced a much more capable retro phone than the equally nostalgic new 3310. You can get your email on it, you can get Google Maps, YouTube, Google Assistant and even sync all your contacts and calendar. It even has a modern 4G data connection, and an app store of sorts.But by including all these things, the 8110 4G is a little too connected for a retro-phone that many may seek out to be less connected to the world. And when you actually try and use these modern services afforded by KaiOS you quickly discover the tedium of trying to use a number pad and its T9 predictive text.If you want a festival phone just for texts and calls, there are cheaper and better dumbphones available that aren’t branded as a reboot of something from your youth. Ditto for those who don’t want or can’t afford a smartphone.The Nokia 8110 4G is a nice little novelty toy, then, but I’d rather have the new 3310 for that.Cons: expensive, tedious T9, not many apps, no WhatsApp, Spotify or Instagram This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The 29-storey glass-fronted skyscraper towers over the low-rise historic centre of La Paz.For Morales and his supporters, it represents a new Bolivia, a break from a painful colonial past. For others it is an overpriced vanity project aimed at glorifying the country’s longest-serving leader.Public disquiet turned to outrage when it was reported Morales would enjoy a 1,068 sq metre suite fitted out with a jacuzzi, sauna, gym and massage room. Other luxuries included a private lift, according to architectural plans leaked to local newspaper Pagina Siete.Bolivia’s communications minister, Gisela López, refused to confirm or deny the report but said the high-rise had been built “for the people” without running over a $34m budget, the state news agency reported.But the building has also become a focal point for growing anger at Morales’ refusal to relinquish power after 12 years and his vow to run for a fourth term in the country’s 2019 elections.Amid street protests, Morales inaugurated the building last Thursday.“We leave behind the palace of a colonial state to come here to the People’s Great House of the plurinational state of Bolivia,” he said in a speech, which listed the many presidents and independence leaders who had been killed inside or near the old palace during Bolivia’s tumultuous past.“It’s another historic milestone thanks to the struggle of the Bolivian people.”At 120 metres tall, the newly completed People’s Great House or Casa Grande del Pueblo looms overthe old government palace, which it replaces.Known as the Burned Palace or Palacio Quemado, the old building – which was twice gutted by fire – will now become a museum.Its replacement flouts municipal bylaws prohibiting high-rise constructions in the city centre but Morales used his party’s parliamentary majority to override the ban.“It’s an insult to the country,” Carlos Toranzo, a political analyst, told the . “(Morales) wants to immortalise himself with a building which is not only anti-aesthetic but also anti-ethical because in Bolivia we don’t have even the right to be ill,” he added, referring to the city’s woefully under-resourced main hospital.Opposition leader Samuel Doria said the new building should be turned into a cancer hospital which, he insists, is an urgent necessity in the country that remains one of South America’s poorest, despite a decade of strong growth.But Morales has brushed off criticism, saying the construction will save government spending by housing, along with the presidential and administrative offices – five ministries that currently rent quarters costing about $20m a year.Topped with a helipad and with three underground floors, the glass-fronted tower has architectural features resembling Tiwanaku, Bolivia’s preeminent archeological site. It features indigenous symbols such as the chakana, or Andean cross, and has several large murals, some of which depict workers overcoming social injustice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9f644ad995eccac984934c4b02a6285b8c816da/0_346_4292_2576/master/4292.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da035308dcc8753548ce5d068a959f0","title":"regreening niger how magical gaos transformed land","story":"Farmers in Niger are nurturing gao trees to drive Africa’s biggest environmental changeRain had come to nearby villages, but not yet to Droum in south-east Niger. The sand under its stately trees looked completely barren, but Souley Cheibou, a farmer in his 60s, was not worried. He crooked a finger, fished in the sand, and brought out a millet seed. In a week or two, this seed would germinate and sprout, and soon the whole field would be green.Cheibou’s peace of mind stemmed from the trees encircling him, which had been standing long before he was born. Despite appearances, these were not any old acacias. They were gao trees – known as winterthorns in English – with unique, seemingly magical powers.From the peanut basin of Senegal to the Seno plains of Mali, to Yatenga, formerly the most degraded region of Burkina Faso, and as far south as Malawi: gaos are thriving in Africa. And over the past three decades, the landscape of southern Niger has been transformed by more than 200m new trees, many of them gaos. They have not been planted but have grown naturally on over 5m hectares of farmland, nurtured by thousands of farmers.According to scientists, what has happened in Niger – one of the world’s poorest countries – is the largest-scale positive transformation of the environment in the whole of Africa. This is not a grand UN-funded project aiming to offset climate change. Small-scale farmers have achieved it because of what the trees can do for crop yields and other aspects of farming life.“It’s a magic tree, a very wonderful tree,” said Abasse Tougiani of Niger’s National Institute of Agricultural Research, who has travelled all over Niger studying Faidherbia albida – the gao’s Latin name.Shielded from the sun, crops planted under the canopy of a tree usually do not do well in the short term, although there can be longer-term benefits. That’s one reason why many west African rainforests have been decimated. But with gaos, it’s the other way round. The root system of the gao is nearly as big as its branches, and unusually it draws nitrogen from the air, fertilising the soil. And unlike other trees in the area, gao tree leaves fall in the rainy season, allowing more sunlight through to the crops at a key moment.Used along with mineral fertilisers, crop yields double under gaos, and the gao-nourished soil holds water better, ensuring a better crop in drought years.Counterintuitively, the great gao regreening is only happening in areas of Niger with high-density populations. With less space to expand into as more people are born, hard-up farmers are increasingly realising that the trees can regenerate degraded land.“It’s literally a story of more people, more trees,” said Chris Reij, a sustainable land management specialist. “The whole point is that the trees are not protected and managed by farmers for their environmental beauty, but because they are part of the agricultural production system.”Inadvertently, the farmers are also doing their bit to offset climate change. Trees are crucial for storing carbon, absorbing it out of the atmosphere. “In mature, fairly dense areas, you get 30 tons of wood per hectare. Half of that is carbon,” said Gray Tappan, a geographer.Efforts to restore 100m hectares of degraded African land by 2030 are underway. The ambitious Great Green Wall project to surround the Sahara desert with trees and other plants has changed beyond recognition after debate over whether desertification - the process by which soil loses its fertitlity - is real. Progress is slow. In Niger, where temperatures often reach the 40s, the trees create a cooler microclimate, and rabbits and jackals are coming back.But none of these grand political projects explains why gaos have caught on. The trees’ pods make very nutritious animal fodder, and fallen branches make good firewood, meaning Droum’s women and children – whose job it is to collect fuel for cooking fires – rarely have to venture further than a few kilometres to find it.Tales about how the gao came to be so revered abound. Legend has it that crimes against gaos have been taken very seriously since the mid-19th century. “If you touched a branch, you would go to jail,” Tougiani said. In splendid brocade robes and curly-toed velvet slippers, surrounded by self-portraits and stick-wielding guards dressed in red and green, today’s district chief in Droum takes a slightly softer approach.“It’s shameful to have to come before the chief and explain yourself. Often that’s punishment enough,” Maman Ali Kaoura said. Droum’s reoffenders face fines of between 5,000 to 10,000 West African CFA francs (£6.75-£13.50), a huge amount for hard-up farmers.A sense of ownership has been key in the regreening of Niger. Until the mid-1980s, every tree was considered to belong to the state. When this changed, regreening began, as people were happier to look after trees that belonged to them. In areas with the best cover, they organised patrols to protect their trees from passing farmers and neighbouring villagers seeking firewood.Once people discovered that “one gao was equal to 10 cows” for fertilising, as Tougiani put it, the tree’s popularity took off. Several schemes, including one where farmers with more than 50 gaos were paid 50 CFA for each one, helped it along.But their loyalty to their gaos could make areas around Zinder the most vulnerable to a disease that Reij and Tougiani have recently spotted killing trees near Niamey, the capital. If it spreads, the losses could be enormous, particularly in places where there is a near-monoculture of gaos.“I’m worried, because it’s green oil for farmers – it’s their wealth,” said Tougiani. “If they lose Faidherbia albida, they’ll lose their way of life. They’ll have to leave the village.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theFor Cheibou, losing his trees is unthinkable – they were his birthright. “I have nearly 100 gao trees in my fields, which I inherited from my father,” he said.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienFrom early morning, yesterday the queries poured into the  helpdesk, where our team of guidance counsellors answered questions in our live blog.Many readers who contacted the team of guidance counsellors were unsure whether they could include the new H7 (39-30 per cent) grade in their points calculation.Their answer is they can, if it is among their best six grades. It’s worth a total of 37 CAO points .In the case of those who sat the Leaving Cert in previous years and are now calculating their CAO score for the purposes of next Monday’s offers, a score of 33 CAO points applies to all E grades under the old system.(The justification for the lesser points score is because an E grade under the previous system applied to a grade between 39-25 as opposed to the new H7 10 per cent band).The largest group of disappointed students seeking our support were some of the 3,000-plus who had failed to secure 40 per cent on the ordinary level maths paper. This excludes them from consideration by many colleges, who require this grade as a minimum entry requirement for most of their courses.Unfortunately, there is no simple solution to their dilemma. In a small number of colleges, special maths exams are been offered to ordinary level students in the coming days, to those who failed to meet the required grade yesterday (see details below).These students, along with thousands of others who are unhappy with a grade they secured in the Leaving Cert, can also review their scripts on the weekend Friday August 31st-Saturday September 1st. They must be present to view scripts.If they consider it worthwhile, they may then apply to have their exam scripts remarked at a cost of €40, the results of which will be available in mid-October.If they are upgraded (which about 20 per cent are each year) they will be retrospectively offered a place on the course.As many courses are half-way through the first term of lectures by this stage, many students who are successful choose to defer their place into 2019.An alternative option for students who have failed to meet entry requirements for their chosen courses may be to apply to their local further education (FE) college to study a programme in their area of career interest. This may also bypass the need to repeat the paper in 2019.They might also consider registering with the State Examinations Commission in the autumn to sit the subject again in June 2019 and prepare for it alongside whatever else they choose to do this year.You can combine Leaving Certificates for the purposes of meeting course entry requirements, but not for points.There is a further group of students who have not failed maths, but who have not met the entry requirements for admission to a range of engineering and other programmes.These colleges are offering special maths exams to enable these students to have a second attempt to meet the required higher-level grade. To book a place on any of these courses contact the colleges directly today. They include:CIT (August 21st): Applicants for any of their courses may sit two papers, one at ordinary level and a second one for those requiring a higher maths standard.Maynooth University (August 21st): Electronic Engineering for those who did not secure a H4.

Gavin Duffy and Joan Freeman said they believed one term in the office was sufficient, with Ms Freeman adding it should be reduced to five years.Mr Duffy outlined his belief that seven years was enough time to spend in one job, but then added he would make his decision on a second term known in the sixth year of his tenure.Both candidates also told Carlow County Council the office of the presidency should come under the FoI Act, with Mr Duffy committing to publishing the information regardless of whether there was legislative change.Travel, accommodation and catering costs should be published but certain correspondence and internal discussion should not be released, Mr Duffy said.This would include conversations with parties in Northern Ireland as that could result in “megaphone diplomacy”.Meanwhile, artist Kevin Sharkey indicated he would have voted for Donald Trump in the US presidential election because he has not “killed as many as the rest of them”.Mr Sharkey said he believed the media must come to terms with Mr Trump’s election and likened the US president to actor John Wayne . Mr Trump gave up “that beautiful wife” and playing golf to enter office, he added.“Trump isn’t any more likeable or unlikable than any of the other US presidents.

Sean Gallagher meanwhile is “actively considering” a second run for the office of president and will announce his intentions within a fortnight.Mr Gallagher registered a website domain name www.seangallagher2018 on Wednesday.The businessman ran in the 2011 presidential election but was defeated by President Michael D Higgins.

But it’s far from it.There is a queue of contenders who think they have what it takes to do the presidential thing. The more they expand and expound on their suitability to do the job, the more you wonder. And in some cases, the more you shake your baffled head in wonder.Four potential candidates travelled to Carlow on Wednesday to ask its county councillors to nominate them for a place on the election ticket.Two are serious contenders for a place on the ballot in October, one appears a long shot and the last hasn’t a snowball’s chance in hell.The councillors were polite and welcoming, but they didn’t seem particularly enthusiastic about any of the supplicants who passed their way in the hope of gaining preferment.At the outset, the chairman pointed out there is still time for more hopefuls to come before them and plead their case. “If I was only five years older I’d be eligible to stand as a candidate,” sighed Brian O’Donoghue (FG), “but I’m not.”Later on, one councillor mentioned that “another big name” would be declaring for the race at the weekend, but he didn’t say who this person might be.Nobody in the sweltering chamber bothered to ask.The two front-runners in this yet-to-be-completed field are businessman Gavin Duffy and Senator and mental health campaigner Joan Freeman. Both arrived with an early-day entourage in tow and each was in possession of a PR big hitter. In Duffy’s case, veteran political adviser, media consultant and field sports advocate, Liam Cahill and in Freeman’s case, author and communications consultant, Natasha Fennell.Artist Kevin Sharkey arrived on his own, armed with half a sheet of paper containing his notes. He was very glad of that sheet of paper because he was able to fan himself furiously with it as the heat levels rose.The last person to throw his hat in the ring was a grey-haired man from Galway called Patrick Feeney, who bamboozled the audience with a very convoluted description of his early years and subsequent work history, from becoming “Juvenile Connaught Boxing Champion: 6st-7” to his years in Aer Lingus via the beatification of Oliver J Plunkett and the revival of the beet industry.Among the four candidates who each believe they are eminently qualified to contest the election and win, Feeney is the only one who has ever stood before the people. He got 22 votes in the last general election, although he “always wanted to run for Galway County Council but I couldn’t get in there”.There was major disappointment midway through the afternoon when a fifth declared speaker – Marie Goretti Moylan – failed to show. “She isn’t in the house,” announced the chair, conjuring up thoughts of Elvis.On the day, it was Sharkey who gave the most arresting performance. Although it was Cllr Arthur McDonald (FF) who put the icing on the cake for him.Sharkey began his pitch by talking about growing up in Donegal. “I was the only black child there.” He then explored the question “What is racism?”. His presidency would be “a platform for opening up a conversation that we need to have as adults”.In the question-and-answer session which followed, Cllr McDonald’s query sent eyebrows shooting up and jaws dropping down.“We live in a country where we elected an atheist President. We have a gay Taoiseach. We’ve brought in orce and now we’ve brought in abortion. I just wonder,” he asked Kevin, “Do you feel that it’s time for a coloured president?”Sharkey, who was taken to task by a number of councillors about his references to Ireland being “predominately” white and needing “to have a conversation about immigration”, insisted the colour of his skin had nothing to do with his fledgling campaign.Those who challenged him and pointed to Ireland’s emigrant experience in America were told that the Irish worked hard, whereas workers coming over from Europe now are coming here “for a support system that is very attractive”.Sharkey, who twice reprimanded the media for being “lazy”, is treading what seems a familiar political path in the light of Donald Trump’s success. “Ireland should come first – that’s not to exclude anyone, that just makes common sense.”Could he get four councils to nominate him? It seems unlikely, but nothing is impossible these days. A number of councillors noted afterwards that he is a very good speaker. Indeed, he spoke fluently for 15 minutes – not always making complete sense – with only that tiny sheet of paper to guide him.And so, finally, to Gavin Duffy and Joan Freeman.Both of them shamelessly soft-soaped the Carlovians about their wonderful county and lovely people before setting out their stalls.“I believe I have the necessary experience, energy, integrity and vision to bring a new and invigorated presidency,” said Gavin, who has a “signature initiative” as his USP (unique selling point). This is his president’s international youth corps, where young people will travel Ireland and do “a tour of duty abroad” helping their fellow men and women.Sort of gap-year missionaries, without the religion.Covering all the bases, his presidency will be founded on “five pillars” of Youth, Age, Diversity and Inclusion, Respect and The Economy. Gavin wants to “just put a bit of verve into people”.All the iniduals he has dealt with over the years – from political and business leaders and people in the wider community – have one thing in common: “They have a dream of making a difference.”Not surprisingly, Joan Freeman will host a summit on mental health.She was quietly impressive, not making any big promises. She would focus on and promote issues in the way Mary McAleese spoke of building-bridges presidency and Mary Robinson looked to the dispossessed.“I am accused of being a one-trick pony” she said. “But that trick is very big.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3594772.1534167807!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what s behind the miraculous spiral on booterstown strand","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA spiral has appeared over the past decade or so on the beach between Booterstown station and the Merrion Gates, southeast of Dublin. A sandbank (pictured) has gradually built up, driven by the action of the sea waves, and has assumed a form close to a logarithmic spiral.We all know what a spiral looks like. Or do we? Ask your friends to describe one and they will probably trace out the form of a spiral staircase. But that is actually a helix a curve in three-dimensional space. A spiral is confined to a plane – it is a flat curve. In general terms, a spiral is formed by a point moving around a fixed centre while its distance increases or decreases as it revolves. There are several kinds of spiral, distinguished by the rate at which the distance increases as the point moves about the centre. If the distance varies in proportion to the angle, we have a spiral named after Archimedes. If the distance changes as the square root of the angle, we get a Fermat spiral. If the distance varies in geometric proportion to the angle, the curve is a logarithmic spiral.Logarithmic spirals – also known as equiangular spirals – abound in the natural world. In the plant kingdom we have ferns and many other plants that curl up into spirals and suddenly spring open to disperse their seeds. The seeds in a sunflower are arranged in logarithmic spiral arcs. Many molluscs, notably the nautilus shell, form almost perfect logarithmic spirals. On a larger scale, the spiral arms of hurricanes often adhere to this mathematical model, as do the cold fronts of extra-tropical depressions. And larger still by many orders of magnitude are the vast arms of spiral galaxies.The logarithmic spiral was first analysed by René Descartes, inventor of co-ordinate geometry. It was also studied by Galileo and by his ace student, Evangelista Torricelli, who found an expression for the length of the spiral arc between any two points on the curve. Jacob Bernoulli was enthralled by the many wonderful properties of the curve and wrote an entire book about it, Spira Mirabilis – The Marvellous Spiral. The logarithmic spiral remains unaltered under a range of geometric transformations. It can be rotated and scaled and still assume its original form. These properties may account for its ubiquity in nature. Evolution often produces the best possible designs, using the smallest amount of material or the least energy, and finds the mathematical shapes that achieve maximal efficiency. A particular logarithmic spiral has attracted the attention of artists. This is the so-called golden spiral, which gets wider by a factor of 1.618, the golden number, for every quarter turn. The golden number has been used by artists going back to Leonardo da Vinci and enthusiasts also find it in the design of the Parthenon. It is frequently claimed that a rectangle whose ratio of length to breadth is the golden number has special aesthetic properties such a claim must be treated with scepticism.A remarkable spiral has appeared over the past decade or so on the beach between Booterstown railway station and the Merrion Gates, southeast of Dublin. A sandbank has gradually built up, driven by the action of the sea waves, and has assumed a form close to a logarithmic spiral. Something must have changed to trigger this development perhaps the outflow of the Elm Park stream, which enters Dublin Bay just north of the sandbank, was altered in some way. It will be interesting to study the development of this evolving physical feature.Peter Lynch is emeritus professor at UCD school of mathematics \u0026amp statistics.

Photograph: Jessica McGowanGetty ImagesThe world did not always notice, so absorbed was it in the fact of his blackness, but Barack Obama sought to de-emphasise race. Had events not forced him into memorable orations on the subject, there is no reason to think he would have given them.Bill Clinton was another US president who saw his nation through the lens of economics rather than blood. It was the outside observer, namely the novelist Toni Morrison, who read racial significance into him. Had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, we would now be well into yet a third technocratic government in as many decades.For all that identity politics has permeated the wider left, the upper reaches of the Democratic party have remained mostly resistant. Some of this is down to a belief that Americans must be addressed as Americans, not as ethnic subsets, as per the ideals of the republic. Some of it is electoral prudence: a party too identified with minorities is asking for trouble with white voters. These two impulses explain the respectful distance between Democrats and the racialised politics of the university campus.Among the legacies of Donald Trump is the narrowing of this distance. Eminent Democrats are embracing race as a cause. Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, calls the criminal justice system “racist”.Kamala Harris, a senator from California and another presidential prospect, resents the term “identity politics”. It belittles the seriousness of race (and gender) inequities, she argues. Georgia’s Stacey Abrams, who could become the first black woman to govern a state, is building a coalition of minority voters, topped up with liberal whites. If it works in November, it could be a template for the national party.After Trump’s election two years ago, Democrats were advised by the likes of Mark Lilla, a professor of humanities at Columbia University, to reject the Balkanisation of the electorate in favour of a universal offering.The most obvious reason why they did not was Trump’s conduct in office. It sapped the Democrats’ belief that race could ever be transcended. If the president’s travel bans and quarrels with black athletes did not demand an explicit defence of minorities, then Charlottesville did.A year has passed since the Virginia town joined Selma and Appomattox as one of those southern place-names that become abstract nouns, denoting racial strife. The president’s equivocal line on far-right violence there persuaded many Democrats that blindness to race, once their ideal, was now a moral abdication. The party had to speak for people who felt besieged, even if it meant distinguishing one kind of American from another.As for the party’s wariness of the white voter, demographic change is easing it. Some Democrats believe the ethnic ersification of certain states, such as Georgia and Arizona, is re-painting them from Republican red to, if not Democratic blue, then the pale mauve of electoral competitiveness.These projections assume rather a lot. And as a political strategy, it also forfeits working-class whites, as though a pitch to them is not worth the discomfort it would cause the metropolitan left. Still, demographics point to a more minority-facing Democratic party.At this point, an old Washington hand will wonder what the fuss is about. There has been a racial pattern to American politics for a long time, with minorities favouring Democrats and Republicans carrying whites. Each party has appealed to its “own”.The difference is that racial politics was, for the most part, implicit. It was a matter of coded language and suggestive television advertisements. At no point did either party stop paying lip service to the ideal of an inisible nation. “They are black, they are white,” said Richard Nixon, even, of his “Silent Majority” in 1968. “They’re native and foreign born.”The new version of racial politics promises to be much more explicit, with each party appealing to ethnic groups in so many words. If this seems implausible, consider how far US politics has changed in just two years.This is the most race-conscious Democratic party since 1988, when Jesse Jackson was briefly frontrunner for its presidential nomination. The change is neither surprising nor necessarily permanent. There was always going to be a counterforce to the blood-and-soil nationalism of the modern right.If the Republicans revert to their pre-Trump ways once he has gone, then the Democrats can go back to the technocratic reticence on race of the Obama-Clinton years. The dread for the republic is that neither reversal ever happens, and the future is fragmentation. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/15/18/Omagh-bombing-anniversary.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3905566  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 15 August 2018  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/15/18/Omagh-bombing-anniversary.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing 2018 lineup contestants graeme swann joe sugg start date","story":"Created with Sketch.The participating celebrities are set to be announced over the coming weeksClick to followThe Independent CultureThe contestants participating in Strictly Come Dancing 2018 are set to be announced over the coming weeks.First\u0026nbspto be confirmed\u0026nbspwas TV presenter and campaigner Katie Piper whose appointment was confirmed on BBC Breakfast on 13 August with Steps star Faye Tozer and Red Dwarf favourite Danny John-Jules following on that night\u0027s edition of The One Show.Next to be announced was YouTuber Joe Sugg, who became the first social media star to sign up for the BBC dancing competition, and Capital FM DJ Vick Hope followed by worried cricketer Graeme Swann.More announcements are to follow today.You can see which four celebrities have been confirmed for Strictly 2018\u0026nbspso far below:Katie Piper, TV presenter and campaignerUK news in picturesPeople gather on Market Street, Omagh, for the ceremony to mark the 20th anniversary of the Omagh bombing on 15 August 1998.

That, and, perhaps, a vague anti-northern prejudice. Sunderland’s overwhelming vote to leave the EU summoned forth ultimatum style letters to the British government from their Japanese automotive overlords to make clear what the hell was going on, specifically re the single market, or face the consequences.But there is an equally, if not more baffling example to be found much closer to the media’s traditional London home. During the height of the EU referendum campaign, scarcely a day went by when some politician or other didn’t walk out from under the wing of an aircraft in some blowy hangar somewhere, to warn of the peril faced by the aviation industry in the event of a Leave vote. In the best case scenario, British airlines would move their head offices to continental Europe. Ticket prices would soar. Air travel would get more difficult. Passport queues would turn blue but quadruple in length. In the worst case, flights would be grounded altogether.But the people of Hayes and Harlington, the west London constituency best understood as the extended baggage carousel for Heathrow airport, took this advice onboard, stowed it in the overhead lockers and went out and voted for Brexit anyway, and by a large margin – 40.6 to 59.4 per cent.But, according to a recent poll, that outlook has changed dramatically. Hayes and Harlington is near the very top of a list of 112 constituencies that have now changed their mind from Leave to Remain. Analysis by Focaldata, published in The Observer, suggests a 12.8 per cent swing.So why has Hayes and Harlington changed its mind?\u0026nbsp“Brexit? What a mess,” says Adam, a man in his twenties, on his way out of a Sainsbury’s near the station. Adam works for a catering company that manages the storage and delivery of airline meals to Heathrow. He won’t say whether he voted Leave or Remain, or even if he voted at all, but is clearly concerned about the potential impact of Brexit on his employer. “Have you seen the money they’re borrowing, Heathrow? Billions, in case it all goes wrong. Billions.”And does he think it is all going to go wrong?“I don’t know. People saying the planes are going to stop taking off and all that. I don’t think that’s going to happen, but you don’t know do you. I don’t think anyone thinks any of the things they said would happen are going to happen. More money for the NHS and all that. There won’t be any more money.”The “billions” Heathrow is borrowing is not quite as Adam claims. At the end of June, the airport refinanced its debt to make more cash available in the event of a no-deal Brexit and whatever catastrophes that might cause. The UK falling out of various international aviation agreements when it leaves the European Union, and flights having to be grounded as a result is widely considered the most catastrophic and therefore the most unlikely outcome of a no deal Brexit. But, on anecdotal evidence alone, it is enough to make Heathrow workers worried.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union A spokesperson for the airport said: “We trust the government to ensure the right steps are taken to ensure planes can take off. Our priority is running a smooth operation.”But that trust is evidently not shared by staff. Almost none of the flight attendants, pilots, retail staff and other Heathrow workers embarking at the airport’s various underground stations are prepared to break instructions passed down from on high about speaking to the media about Brexit, but one young woman, who says she is a construction engineer, says “Who knows what’s going to happen? It’s not exactly all going to plan is it?”Hard Brexit, soft Brexit, no-deal Brexit or no Brexit at all, Heathrow’s third runway becomes more likely by the day, but the likelihood of it opening within a decade is limited, and does not factor in to the day to day concerns of the majority of the current workforce.In the event of a second referendum on the terms of Brexit, itself a growing likelihood, the precise geographical location of anyone who has changed their mind will not matter. But it does heap pressure on local MPs who may no longer be able to claim to be acting on the will of their constituents. And Hayes and Harlington’s MP is in a particularly curious spot. John McDonnell spent decades in parliament walking through the ision lobbies with the usual Eurosceptics, became shadow chancellor and campaigned rather lukewarmly for remain. Now he is at the forefront of Labour’s Brexit policy which is generously described as “constructively ambiguous”.His neighbouring constituency, Uxbridge and south Ruislip, represented by Boris Johnson, has also apparently had a change of heart. If Brexit does go wrong, it is hard to see how John McDonnell’s constituents will express their change of heart on Brexit at the ballot box. They are certainly unlikely to do so by voting Conservative.50:50 chance of a no-deal Brexit, says Latvian foreign ministerA no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for cities like LiverpoolBrexiteers drawing up plan ‘to rival May’s Chequers proposal’Public backing for Final Say referendum leaps, new poll showsMore than 100 constituencies which backed Brexit now back Remain“One of the reasons I campaigned for Remain was because I was deeply worried about impact on the aviation industry and Heathrow. I have especially consistently and at times vociferously explained that a Tory no-deal Brexit would have massive consequences for Heathrow and the aviation sector overall,” Mr McDonnell told The Independent.“I have never thought Brexit would be good for airport workers in my constituency. That’s why I campaigned against it. Although we all respect the referendum result we need a government that will protect jobs and the economy and recognises the real vulnerabilities of the aviation industry. With the way this Government has handled the negotiations on Brexit I am not surprised that airport workers are now also worried about the future of their industry.”It is clear that a general election will not give the people of Hayes and Harlington the opportunity to express their new found doubts about Brexit.

Around two-thirds of Scots think the UK is ignoring their concerns and don’t trust Westminster to take the decisions.”He continued: “But the survey suggests the leaderships of both the SNP and the Labour Party are in the wrong place with most of their supporters. There may be an electoral idend in Scotland for one of these parties if they strengthen their position.“For instance, by a margin of three to one Labour supporters want Jeremy Corbyn to campaign for a public vote, while Nicola Sturgeon may yet want to move faster than she has in backing such a route on Brexit.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/09/06/ilhan-omar-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/09/06/ilhan-omar-1.jpg","title":"ilhan omar wins minnesota democratic primary victory speech watch","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027In my last race, I talked about what my win would have meant for that eight-year-old girl in that refugee camp,\u0027 she tells crowdClick to followThe Independent USIlhan Omar, who is likely to become the first Somali-American elected to US Congress, made history on Tuesday by winning a seat in Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District.The politician garnered national attention just two years ago after becoming the first Somali American elected to a state legislature in Minnesota - unseating a 22-term Democratic incumbent.In my last race, I talked about what my win would have meant for that eight-year-old girl in that refugee camp,” she told a crowd of supporters after her win.\u0026nbspJahana Hayes could be Connecticut\u0027s first black Democrat in CongressTransgender candidate Christine Hallquist makes history in VermontAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez supports Kaniela Ing in Hawaii primaries“And today, today, I still think about her and I think about the kind of hope and optimism all of those eight-year-olds around the country and around the world get from seeing your beautiful faces elect and believe in someone like me.“So I humbly thank you.

But she knew I feel the cold easily and sent it to me. She sent some honey too, but it went missing on the way. The coat is made of dog fur. I don\u0027t know what kind of dog. In 2010, it cost about 700,000 North Korean won ($88 at the unofficial rate). It was really expensive. A North Korean friend went to China to pick it up for me. I liked this coat when I got it. I thought my mother must\u0027ve spent quite a lot of money on it.  The dog fur coat belonging to Kang, My father was a party officer. Our family had a car and we lived in a special apartment. Ordinary people couldn\u0027t afford to wear this kind of coat, not even soldiers. Commissioned officers could afford them. Border guards would wear them. It wasn\u0027t easy to buy this kind of coat, but as time went on, fake ones began to appear. The state often clamped down on this item. It\u0027s technically military supplies so the state monitored people who altered the design of the coat. I know just from looking at this coat that it\u0027s a counterfeit one, not the official version. The counterfeit ones look quite different from the original ones. Military officials preferred the fakes to the original because the design looked much better. The children of rich families would wear them. I look too chubby in this, so don\u0027t wear it here. I thought I could probably wear it if I altered it.Lee Oui-ryuk is from Onsong, near the border with China. He defected in 2010, and brought his ID card with him. I brought my ID with me when I left North Korea. Juche 95.11.7 (the date in the North Korean calendar, which equates to Nov. 7, 2006) is the date I was issued with my ID. It says here my blood type is A, but I\u0027m actually an O. For the 23 years I lived in North Korea, I thought my blood type was A. They wrote down my blood type without even doing a test. They just wrote whatever they wanted to. I was caught trying to defect to South Korea around Kim Jong Il\u0027s birthday. They strengthen border security just before and after that date.The bottom of the lamp is dark, as the saying goes, and I thought I\u0027d be able to cross right under their noses. The soldiers shot at me as I tried to run away from the Tumen River. I managed to get away and hid, but someone reported me and I was caught. That\u0027s when I was taken to the bowibu (North Korean secret police) for three months of interrogation. The state ruled that I had tried to defect to South Korea, and I was sent to a camp for political prisoners. I escaped when they were transferring me to the camp. I hid and managed to make it to my big sister\u0027s house - that\u0027s when I grabbed these photos. I couldn\u0027t go home easily, so decided I had to hide in the mountains or somewhere remote. I needed my ID to move around without getting caught. and I took these 12 photos with me in case I wanted to look back and reminisce. I wrote on the back of them so as not to forget.Ji Sung-ho, 35, from Hoeryong, near the border with China. He left North Korea in 2006 with a pair of wooden crutches. I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coals from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand. I had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn\u0027t have them, I wouldn\u0027t have made it here. The state doesn\u0027t help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made, so they\u0027re not perfect and break easily. I had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. I would steal coal from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they\u0027d take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside.When I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. South Korea\u0027s intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. But I couldn\u0027t just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches. There is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn\u0027t throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories. Kim Ryen Hui, 48, is from Pyongyang. She says she never wanted to defect. In 2011, she says, a broker helped her go to China for treatment on her liver. But the broker tricked her, she said, and she ended up in South Korea. She is campaigning to return, which Seoul says would be against the law. I miss my parents even more than I miss my daughter. They\u0027re everything to me. For the first few years, I couldn\u0027t even breathe properly when I thought of them. My little brother lives with them in Pyongyang now. My mother can\u0027t see out of one eye. The thing I fear the most is finding out they\u0027ve passed away before I have the chance to go back. My daughter and I have been writing letters and sending photos to each other. My cousin lives in China, so she\u0027s been sending them on. My daughter\u0027s name is Ri Ryon Gum. She was born on February 15, 1993. I don\u0027t want her to live out her life with me here. When she was young, she did taekwondo. She wanted to get involved in espionage operations against South Korea. She was so fearless. That\u0027s why she was doing taekwondo - to get involved in anti-South espionage. So I was really surprised to hear she became a chef. In a video of her I received, she explained why. She said that after I had left, she moved in with her father in Pyongyang and had been cooking for him. She said she decided to become a chef so she could fulfill my role at home. I was sad when I heard that.Lee Min-bok, 60, was a researcher at North Korea\u0027s Academy of Agricultural Science. He first tried to defect, unsuccessfully, in 1990. He eventually left North Korea in June 1991 and came to South Korea in 1995. His family sent him these diaries. I have a bit of an academic side. According to Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, people are supposed to keep diaries. Everyone in North Korea should strictly follow Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, so I did as I was supposed to and kept a diary. Even though Kim Il Sung is a villain here, in North Korea he\u0027s above everything. We learned that he studied well and gave our lives purpose. I lived according to those teachings. I wrote these out of loyalty to the Leader. That was our ideology, and I lived my life in strict adherence to it. No one could think differently.I got hold of these diaries 10 years after I arrived in South Korea. I had been sending money to my family in the North and they sent them to me. I didn\u0027t write any complaints in diaries. I would\u0027ve been in big trouble if I did. My diaries are a record of my history in North Korea. I am thinking about turning these diaries into a book. I\u0027d like to publish a book about how to change North Koreans\u0027 thinking when unification happens. These diaries show how North Koreans think and how their minds are constructed. People need to make these into a textbook, because they need proof. Talking is not as effective.Song Byeok was a propaganda artist. His father drowned trying to cross the Tumen river, in 2000. When the artist finally left North Korea in 2001, he brought photos of his family with him. We left that August to find food, Byeok recalled, describing the first attempt. We were from a town further inland, and we weren\u0027t sure where the river was high and where it was low. I didn\u0027t know at the time but the river was swollen because of the rainy season. I thought we had to cross it anyway. All I could think about was getting to China to buy food. I took off my clothes and tied them into a rope to strap us together. I told my father not to let go. As we approached the middle of the river, the strap felt lighter. I looked back and saw my father drifting away. I was devastated.He was going under the water and couldn\u0027t get out. I rushed up to the (North Korean) border guards and asked them to save him but they just said why did I come out, why didn\u0027t I die too. They handcuffed me and took me away. It was Aug. 28. I was tortured by the bowibu (North Korean secret police) in Hoeryong, then jailed for four months in Chongjin prison camp. But after I was released from the camp I felt like I needed to survive and carry on living. Right before I tried to defect again, I went back home and grabbed my family photos. Even if I died trying, I thought, at least I would have this picture with me. I never found my father. After I came to South Korea, I went back to China in 2004 and held a memorial service for him by the river. My heart still aches.Baek Hwa-sung, 33, left Sinuiju, on the border with China, in 2003 and resettled in South Korea in 2008. He kept a diary as he defected. In 2004, I started to write down all my thoughts in a diary. I didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d get caught. I just wanted to let it be known where I was from, and where I wanted to go. After I left the North, I became very depressed, hiding in the mountains alone for a while. The people who were watching over me told me not to come down to the village and left me by myself in a mountain shelter. Alone, with no one to engage with or talk to, I felt like I would go insane. So I wanted to leave something behind in case I died there or got caught - that\u0027s why I started to write.Alone in the mountains, I desperately sought something to talk to. That was my diary. My diaries are proof of my life\u0027s journey. I read them when I want to remember home. I can\u0027t return home, and I already have no memories of my hometown. But when I go through my diaries, there are notes which detail the vivid memories of that time. Sometimes I might forget my father\u0027s birthday, but when I go back to my diary, his birthday and my mother\u0027s birthday are there. My diaries are a record of my life. They prove I\u0027m alive.A hat belonging to Jeong Min-woo in Seoul. Min-woo is from Hyesan, on the border with China.

But details of the case are\u0026nbspmurky.From meetings in McDonald’s, the group is alleged to have agreed on a revolution via social media and leafleting. Police arrested 10\u0026nbspmembers of the group in March.The rally in Moscow’s central New Pushkin Square\u0026nbspstyled itself as a “mothers’ march”. Huddled under umbrellas, the mostly female protesters carried toys of their sons and daughters. Some carried unicorns in\u0026nbspreference to the “My Little Pony” that\u0026nbspAnna Pavlikova,\u0026nbspthe youngest of the imprisoned anarchists, loved to collect. But with political messages banned, it also\u0026nbspwas the protesters’ way of identifying each other and avoiding arrest.\u0026nbsp“This is my son’s little tiger,” said Yekaterina Milanovskaya, 40, holding up an orange soft toy. “We bought it for him on his first new year. He’s 14 now,\u0026nbspall brave and happy. But it doesn’t take much to imagine him getting involved in\u0026nbspa little mutiny somewhere, and getting\u0026nbsparrested. That’s what authorities are doing. They want\u0026nbspto scare people like me, to keep the\u0026nbspkids from protesting.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJournalist Anna Narinskaya, one of the organisers of the\u0026nbspprotest, told The Independent that the rally’s aims\u0026nbspwere two-fold: to bring attention to the “injustice” of the case and to demand the release the two youngest members of the group, who are\u0026nbspsuffering from serious ill-health. Anna Pavlikova, now 18,\u0026nbsphas lost part of her hearing, and Maria Dubovik,19, has a tumour. Both also\u0026nbspsuffer from panic attacks.\u0026nbsp“We are against the whole absurd case, but even on the government’s own terms as they present to us, the treatment of these girls goes beyond the humane,” she said. “This protest has been organised by mothers for mothers. We understand that all of our children are at risk. Any of them could be tricked into something like this.”\u0026nbspThe existence of the opposition movement seems to have come as a surprise to everyone except Russia’s law enforcement.\u0026nbspThe group is alleged to have undertaken weapons training ahead of a revolutionary campaign. But the main sources of the evidence are security officers who infiltrated their network. At least one played a significant role in directing the group’s activities.\u0026nbspAccording to supporters and\u0026nbsplawyers acting for the youngsters, the actions of security services amounted to an illegal act of provocation. They say the security agents were instrumental in pushing the group to greater militancy.\u0026nbsp“They invented the revolution themselves and then found people to fill the gaps,” says organiser Ms Narinskaya.\u0026nbspAhead of the rally, police warned that participation\u0026nbsprisked fines and arrests. As per Russia’s controversial protest laws, any political gathering requires permission from local authorities. Opposition actions are rarely granted permission without long delays, or locations away from the city centre. As a result, organisers\u0026nbspdid not even try to get permission.

RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: \u0026ldquoStrengthening the tyre labelling regulations is good news for UK motorists and road safety generally.Currently, there is no requirement for tyre fitters to show labels at the point of purchase so motorists are oblivious to the pros and cons of the tyres they are buying.As a result few motorists are shown the labels when buying tyres, leaving them completely in the dark about the three ratings of fuel efficiency, wet grip and passing noise.Updating the regulations should fix this by making it mandatory for tyre labels to be shown to motorists in all situations.\u0026ldquoInformation on tyres\u0026rsquo snow and ice performance is going to be included which will be very beneficial.The labels are also being future-proofed as the amended regulations allow for the addition of other useful information such as ratings for mileage, wear and a potential indication for re-treaded tyres.

Don’t they know many thousands of people agree with him? Or do they chose to again ignore the people of this country? Any movement on Boris from the out-of-touch Government will cost them dear.SO Dominic Grieve has threatened to quit Parliament if Boris Johnson became PM. I can think of no better reason for wishing him success.BANG on Boris, about the burka. It being worn in public is scary for children who see it.FREEDOM of speech must not be compromised – and there can be no question of legal action being taken against Boris Johnson, it would be prejudiced by all the attacks on him.THIS week it has been especially hard to be a Muslim woman. Apparently I am not getting the joke, I’m over sensitive, bullied, oppressed, unintegrated, politically motivated, dividing Britain – this list goes on. Perhaps Boris Johnson’s Etonian education did not enable him to understand that in polite society it’s rude to comment with ridicule on the way people dress.ONE thing critics of Boris Johnson’s burka comment overlook is the impact of burka-wearers on those who are deaf and rely on seeing facial expressions, and lip-reading.THE do-gooders complaining about Boris are fanning the flames of hatred by highlighting issues that one wouldn’t really think about. Talk about “integration” appears to be one-sided and discriminatory towards the indigenous people. There is some equilibrium lacking in our “fair, just and equal” land of ours.WHILE I am not sure Boris used a good choice of words likening women in burkas to pillar boxes, he was right that we are frightened by what it represents. We must not destroy Boris, he is good for the people of this country, he cares. He must also be allowed to speak honestly, he has nothing to apologise for.LIGHTEN up, Boris spoke the thoughts of many millions of Brits. If making a gaffe was against the law, Prince Philip could have been banged up in the Tower of London on many occasions during the last 50 years. He wrote the book on it.Boris might have an agenda – what politician doesn’t? – but this mustn’t mean people don’t have a right to voice criticism. Face veils in public, and burkas, are not religious requirements and we must have the right to criticise the wearers.IF I was Boris Johnson, I would agree to attend the diversity training some have suggested . . . and then tear the training session to pieces.I SAW Ranvir Singh berating her guests on morning TV for daring to agree with Boris Johnson? I wonder what her bosses would say if she suggested that she presented her programme wearing a burka. I think we all know the answer to that.PHIL GROWDENNOTHING Theresa May says can be taken at face value. Not so long ago, she promised to stop the witch-hunt of British soldiers, who have seen action and survived in many parts of the world. However, the victimisation of our veterans continues unabated. They are now joined by Boris Johnson, who has frequently ignited the Prime Minister’s wrath and must therefore, be thrown to the wolves.A BUS company has apologised after a driver told a woman to remove her niqab. So would a bank apologise if a security guard asked a man to remove his ski mask?HOW would I stand as a Christian male finding a Muslim lady, dressed in a burka, having a heart attack? Would I be allowed to remove her veil to perform mouth-to-mouth?THE controversy surrounding Boris Johnson’s burka comments has reached ridiculous heights. Police conducting an investigation. Really?IF Theresa May had the guts to ban the burka like a lot of other countries, we might not be having this discussion about what Boris Johnson said.SOMETHING featureless with a rectangular hole in it can resemble a letter box, there’s probably one on your front door, go and have a look. It has also been known for the person inside to be a terrorist, not an innocent woman. Stop being so pathetic, have a sense of humour, act like adultsI READ about a motorcyclist at a filling station having to remove his crash helmet while a woman (who could have been a criminal’s getaway driver) filling up at the pump next to him was wearing a burka. Meanwhile Boris’s remarks are causing hysteria.I HAVE been visiting garden centres and supermarket car parks in my car, which is bedecked with Brexit stickers, asking many people their opinion on the Boris situation. For Boris, I find there is a great deal of love out there. For the Chequers “deal” there is none.IT’S true that Boris Johnson has used strong language but Muslim terrorists are doing far worse things than robbing banks, by committing terrorist atrocities. It would be a sad day when the Muslim community can’t take such a comment, especially when many Muslim women, in my view, do not want this clothing themselves.IT’S confirmed, lunatics are ruining the country. We have the enemy (EU) knocking art the door and all the idiots can find to discuss is Boris Johnson’s perfectly fair comment. If it wasn’t so serious it would be funny. Brexit should be top of the agenda.THERE are easily as many people who agree with BoJo’s comments as those who don’t. So why is it those who don’t will instigate an investigation, leaving those who do without a voice? Even senior Muslims and imams have said that the burka is not a requirement in Islam, so why is it we only tend to listen to those who are offended?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Last Leg is a television safe space, the authentic voice of the PC establishment and as predictable as the sun rising in the morning.So you knew, long before Friday’s transmission, that they’d be targeting Boris, who is a thousand times funnier and edgier than anyone on this show, in his own way.Nearly a whole working week host Adam Hills and his two mates had to prepare some decent material as well, and this was the best three professional comedians could do.Alex Brooker: “The burka is an item of clothing worn by a human being, the other is a postbox, you f***ing idiot.”Adam Hills: “I’d much rather sit next to a person in burka than a p***k in a suit.”Josh Widdicombe: “Theresa May has only just realised Boris is a t**t, so she should apologise as well.”On and on it went, for 12 minutes and 54 seconds, a figure I mention because I’ve had the clock on this lot, and if you want to know exactly how much of a toss they really give about religious sensitivities then it’s best measured by the fact this series of The Last Leg has devoted just 65 hand-wringing seconds to the anti-Semitic poison infecting the Labour Party.It was crammed hurriedly into the previous episode, which was worth watching just to see Adam Hills describe Corbyn’s handling of this crisis as “a faux pas”, (which isn’t French for “shameful cluster-f***”) and the C4 audience react with evident discomfort because he’d drawn attention to the Labour leader’s failings and, therefore, broken one of comedy’s secret and golden rules.If you doubted these rules exist, incidentally, then ever the virtue-signalling fool, Adam Hills was good enough to spell them out for us on Friday.“Every religion should be open to ridicule . . . but you kind of need to be in the club.“Alex and I can make jokes about disabilities as we’re technically disabled.”Boris, he then explained, can’t make jokes about burkas, ’cos he’s “a white Etonian”, nor could comedy giant Rowan Atkinson defend him, as he was “a white man who lives in Oxford and drives an F1 car”.Even if we ignore the fact he’s assumed that all Muslims are black, something pretty staggering is going on here.For Mary Whitehouse, in all her pearl-clutching glory, never imagined anything quite as Draconian and controlling as this form of satirical Apartheid.Adam Hills has a point, though, when he uses the word “club”. That’s exactly what television comedy has become.A closed, left-wing shop where you don’t even bother joining the audience unless you follow the rigid “Tories and Brexit are evil” party line.This is not creating comedy, it’s policing it, and also the reason why applause has replaced laughter on all those Channel 4 and BBC news satires which have failed to realise there is only one simple rule to be observed when creating these shows: Make it funny, dumbo.I would suggest, at this point, Adam Hills gets off his moral high horse, for once, and gives this “funny” idea a go.But then I could also ask Boris to have a crack at anchoring the British women’s 4x100m relay team to gold at the next Olympics, wearing a burka, and I’d know there was only the remotest chance of one ever happening.Run Boris, run.MEANWHILE, back on Channel 4’s Meet The Drug Lords: Inside The Real Narcos, Jason “Foxy” Fox was with the Colombian navy this week and desperate for a look inside one of the incredible home-made submarines they’d confiscated from drug-smugglers.“Is it locked?”“Yes.”And there’ll be more Bafta-worthy action from Foxy and his forward-planning department this week, I’m sure.EVER since it discovered that Danny Dyer was the rightful heir to the English throne, Who Do You Think You Are? has been struggling to find a purpose, or indeed a celebrity, who could see the bigger picture.That special someone who would acknowledge history’s great events with more than a few “wows” and shrugs and not think their own career made all of their ancestors’ suffering worthwhile.Finally, last night, they found him.Judge Robert Rinder, who as well as having the best brain at ITV (Luna the Labrador off This Morning has the second best) also turns out to be a natural television journalist, telling the story of his maternal great-grandfather, Israel, and his beloved grandfather, Morris, simply, beautifully and without ever letting the details overwhelm him.The former fled revolutionary Latvia at the turn of the last century.The latter’s entire family was wiped out in Treblinka’s gas chambers.Yet he somehow survived the Buchen-wald, Theresienstadt and Schlieben concentration camps and made it to Britain, which offered him salvation, friendship, justice and, above all, a sense that “life is worth living” that has been passed down through eternally grateful generations.It’s a remarkable story, so if you missed it, try to catch tonight’s repeat (BBC1, 11.25pm).SCENES and characters the viewers are unlikely to forget in a hurry on the final episode of BBC2’s wonderful Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.First stop, the President’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida, where Ed spent the most uncomfortable night of his life, since Strictly, at a one-year-in-office party for Trump, with Toni Holt Kramer and a group of fans who were called The Trumpettes, but could well have been the provisional wing of The Golden Girls.If you thought they were a bit sinister, though, he was then off squirrel hunting in the forests of Georgia with two hillbillies who might not have been plucking banjos but they certainly had the mad cackling laughs and slightly unsettling line in hospitality.“Are you ready to be a man today, Ed?” asked one, as you began to wonder if he could escape with his dignity intact, let alone blend in with the local gene pool.Then he suddenly reappeared – and this was a masterstroke – wearing a Norwich City scarf.Scrub everything I ever said about Ed Balls.The man’s a diplomatic genius.Sent in by Rob Milner, East Yorkshire.

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all.

He says he was told that he couldn’t speak at the wedding and that Harry berated him on the phone for mishandling the Press while he was recovering from a heart attack.The official royal response to these outbursts has been, effectively, to shove their fingers in their ears and shout la-la-la (or lah-lah-lah).The snobby courtiers and hangers-on dismiss Markle père as fame-hungry.That’s not altogether wrong — he is clearly desperate, as he proved by posing for snaps with the paparazzi in the run-up to the wedding.But it’s not good enough to wish he’d just go away.Meghan is now one of the most photographed and sought-after women in the world. Her very well-paid PR flunkies should have seen these familial landmines a mile off and defused them.But they have failed.Thomas Markle is a difficult and proud man, no doubt. But that is why he should have been treated with care, not frozen out.Why did Team Windsor not find him a role and approach him long before the wedding to make sure he didn’t feel excluded.It’s hard not to feel for him.His ex, Meghan’s mother Doria, was hailed as one of the stars of the wedding.Because she’s a black woman, she invited lots of gushing commentary about the monarchy becoming more diverse and modern.Amen to that. But poor old podgy Thomas, an awkward-looking white bloke, has been shunned from his daughter’s nuptials. You can’t blame him for speaking out.The royal courtiers enjoy the adulation the monarchy receives because Prince Harry has been “brave” enough to marry a woman with a complicated background.But the Palace spin machine freaks out when it comes to confronting the reality of Meghan’s parentage.Perhaps they just find it too vulgar.Harry’s PR man is Jason Knauf, an American specialist in “crisis management” having worked for Royal Bank of Scotland. He excels at sending angry letters to journalists he feels have gone too far snooping into Harry and Meghan’s private lives.But he doesn’t seem to have a clue as to how to handle his clients’ grumpy relatives.As a result, the monarchy is facing arguably its worst crisis since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.We are often told how brilliant the Royal Family’s PR is. Part of the new royal spin, in fact, is about how great the royals now are at spin. They have “rebranded” the monarchy for the 21st century, and so on.Look at the blizzard of positive guff accompanying Prince William, Kate, and Harry’s campaign for mental illness last year.They were, it was said, making the younger Windsors seem more touchy-feely.At the moment, however, they don’t seem sensitive enough to speak to Meghan’s suffering in-laws.That’s not what you’d call a good look.The truth is, royal press officers have long got too much credit.The British admire the Queen because she is admirable.Overall, we prefer monarchy to any other system of government. That’s just common sense. It’s nothing to do with any ingenious branding and media strategy.The public also feels that the younger royals deserve a chance.At a time when our country is consumed by Brexit and political arguments, the wedding of Harry and Meghan came as a blessed relief — something we could all celebrate.The couple both came from broken homes, and nobody cared so long as they were happy. That’s all great.   But it’s obvious that Meghan has, as one royal expert put it, “background baggage that needs unpacking”.Insiders now say the treatment of the Markle family has been a “shambles”.This is before we consider the potential PR bombshells that could erupt if and when Meghan’s ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, decides to grant some interviews.The British don’t want to see the monarchy turned into a reality TV soap, as the Markles and Windsors wage a media war with each other.It’s trashy and embarrassing.But unless the Palace can tackle Meghan’s disgruntled kin, that’s exactly what is happening.Maybe we need a changing of the royal PR guard — before it’s too late.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead, he tried to block it out -  using music as a distraction.But after months of torment, Kyle resorted to trying to cut the sinister presence out of his head once and for all.In pure desperation, he took a blade and hacked into his skull just above his right ear - the point where it sounded like the voice was coming from.He passed out from blood loss. When he came to, the voice told him hed killed someone and Kyle believed it.Scared and confused, Kyle told a stranger that hed committed murder, and she called the police.Kyle then ran - fearing hed be locked up - and called his mum.When she found him, he had blood all over his face and had no choice but to confess everything about the voice.He was sent to a mental health ward, where he stayed for a month.Hes now using a combination of medication and therapy to get rid of the voice which has ruined his life - or at least quiet it down - and has a new job as a valet.In many cases, talking with therapists about the origins of voices can help to ease sufferers worries, and many can use the same coping mechanisms as people with anxiety to remain calm during intense episodes.But hell always bear the knife scar on his head, and for many people with schizophrenia, they must live their lives in the knowledge that the voices will never fully go away.Symptoms of schizophrenia can include having muddled thoughts, undergoing behavioural changes, and experiencing hallucinations and delusions.In some people, schizophrenic behaviours start suddenly, while they develop over time for others.Mental health charity Mind says: Some people think hearing voices means someone is dangerous, when voices are actually more likely to suggest that you harm yourself than someone else.Its also important to remember that people have a choice in whether they do what the voices say.The NHS says you should see your GP as soon as possible if you are experiencing the symptoms of schizophrenia.More information is available on the Mind website. Emmalina is sweeping the floor in her kitchen when shes interrupted by a sinister voice.Im going to kill you when you go outside, it says.Nobody else can hear it, but according to Emmalina, its the voice of the devil - a regular presence who torments her at her lowest moments and leaves her too scared to leave the house.Shes been hearing voices since she was eight and talking back to them for the past three years.As well as the devil, she lives with a voice called Katie - her closest friend - and the voice of her mother.Katie helped me get through really tough times when I was younger, Emmalina says.Emmalina endured sexual abuse and bullying in her childhood, and experts say that early trauma is often associated with hearing voices or developing multiple personalities.I wouldnt have got through childhood without Katie, Emmalina says. My life was unbearable.But Katie isnt always supportive of her.Emmalina says that in the past, Katies voice has told her to cut herself and to smash her own wrists with a hammer.The voice also routinely abuses her, calling her a fat b***h while she eats and even filling her head with racial slurs on the rare occasions when she ventures away from home.These days, Emmalina finds it difficult to leave the house at all, thanks to the increasingly frequent influences of the voice she attributes to the devil.Speaking in a sinister, upper-class accent, it routinely tells her that shell be killed if she steps outside.Im going to burn the skin off your bones, it says. Im going to drag you down to hell. Im going to get you.The voices threats have become so debilitating that Emmalina had to leave her job as a nursery assistant, and now relies on a support worker to try and control her condition.Schizophrenia is often misunderstood, and Australian TV show You Cant Ask That recently aired an episode where sufferers address misconceptions about the condition.Sufferers say that taking medication can suppress the voices, but at the height of their illnesses some reported hearing the voices of dead relatives, unborn children and - like Emmalina - the devil.Sandy can hear two voices, one male and one female.“They used to sound really crass in the way they spoke, but in the last 10 years they’ve done elocution, she says on the show.So now my voices abuse me with a posh accent.“They will tell me how evil I am, how disgusting I am, how disgusting I look, how my face is revolting, how if people touch me they will die because I will contaminate them with my oozing evil.”Other schizophrenic episodes have seen sufferers starve themselves - believing they were being told to by the Grim Reaper - and become convinced that theyre the target of government conspiracies.I have this lingering delusion in the back of my mind that Tony Blair has implanted a micro-chip in my left ear to delete my thoughts, Sandy adds.Fellow sufferer Steve adds: I hear voices all the time. Even just sitting here.“In the early days when I was unwell, if I didn’t do what the voices told me to do they would just get louder and louder and louder.For Chaz, the emergence of a voice which she calls Victor almost proved fatal.Victor has been an unwelcome fixture in Chaz life since 2013, but she was too scared of being sectioned to tell anyone about it.The voice heaps constant abuse on her, telling her that she has no right to be alive and that she can end the torment by killing herself.You should die, the voice says, during one particularly nasty outburst. Just die.After eight months of Victors constant goading, Chaz jumped from a bridge.I didnt want to hear it any more and I wanted everything to disappear, she says. I dont really remember being on the bridge.The police shouted my name. I turned towards them, turned back towards the bridge and just stepped off.Today, the former skateboarder is in a wheelchair as the result of the suicide attempt, which left her with a broken foot, two smashed wrists, a fractured pelvis and a fractured sternum.Chaz still hears Victors voice, and it sometimes even teases her about the day she almost died.I put you in a wheelchair, Victor says, and Chaz hears a foul-spirited laugh inside her head.Now, Chaz refuses to let Victor control her life. She writes and recites poetry about her condition to try and drown the voice out, and hopes to find love soon.I know its hard for anyone to be my friend, she says. But I do actually want to meet people. Id like a girlfriend.But its hard to get someone to stay around.

Quickly it began to grow larger and became painful to touch.She was referred to an eye specialist at NHS Teeside by her GP, but the cause of the swelling remained a mystery.There was no scarring or inflammation on the upper eyelid, just a lump close to her nose.An MRI of the eye showed a cyst behind her left eye and she required surgery to remove it.It was during the surgery that doctors realised the cyst was a hard contact lens.But it still didnt explain where the contact lens had come from.Then her mother remembered that she was hit in the eye with a shuttlecock while playing badminton when she was 14.At the time she was wearing contact lenses but one of them wasnt found, so they assumed it fell out.She suffered swelling around the eye that eventually went down and she never wore hard contact lenses again.We can infer that the lens migrated into the patient’s left upper eyelid at the time of trauma and had been in situ for the last 28 years, Dr Sirjhun Patel wrote in the BMJ case report.The patient also had a droopy left eyelid, which doctors assumed was also caused by the rogue contact lens.Her vision was not damaged and she made a full recovery once the lens was removed.The migration of a rigid gas permeable (RGP) lens into the eyelid is a rare cause of eyelid swelling, Dr Patel added.Spontaneous migration of a hard contact lens into the eyelid is a relatively known occurrence, but we were only able to find four reported cases of lens migration secondary to significant trauma.This case report exhibits the longest time between traumatic RGP lens migration into the eyelid and presentation of eyelid swelling."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004266613892.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour mp refuses six times to say jeremy corbyn is fit to be pm and hints he could be ousted as leader next month","story":"Madeleine Moon failed six times when asked to say if the Labour leader was fit to become Prime Minister.She blasted him for dominating newspaper headlines with negative coverage over his controversial trip to Tunisia in 2014.He has admitted he laid a wreath to honour members of the Black September terrorists who killed 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich 1972 - but refused to apologise to the widows for attending.After pictures emerged of him at the ceremony at a cemetery in Tunis, Mr Corbyn initially denied he was involved - saying he was marking the deaths of 47 people in Israeli airstrikes in 1985.But he has since changed his story several times, and now faces a House of Commons probe over failing to properly declare the trip to the authorities.The Labour boss has come under increasing pressure this week, which comes on the back of the partys ongoing anti-Semitism crisis.And today Ms Moon, the MP for Bridgend, hinted that Mr Corbyn could face moves to oust him as early as Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool next month.She told TalkRadio: “Individuals as leaders come and go.

But they were barely 16 miles out when they were tracked down by English Commodore Charles Wager, in command of four British ships including HMS Expedition.Wager’s plan was to seize the San José, the largest ship in the fleet. But before it could be boarded, something went terribly wrong and the San José blew up.Writing in his log, Wager described an explosion so intense that he could feel the heat from his own ship.He wrote: I believe the ship’s side blew out, for she caused a sea that came in our ports.

Around 46 per cent of 25 to 34 year-olds now live in private rentals as house prices rocket.Some 80 per cent of the tenancies in England and Wales are set at six or 12 months.Charities warned this leaves tenants at the risk of eviction at short notice- and demanded a change.Shelter chief Polly Neate last night said the Government’s decision was “very good news” that would transform the lives of many struggling to make ends meet.She said: “The current renting system is a complete mess, with families teetering on the edge of blink-and-you-miss-it six-month contracts – barely enough time to set your broadband up, let alone see your kids through school.“This problem will not be fixed by giving landlords a tax break to coax them into doing what everyone should be doing anyway.”Shelter earlier this week said 55 per cent of private renters believe longer tenancies would improve their situation.And they claimed two-thirds of renters would think better of a political party that brought in longer contracts.GOT a story?

Yesterdays employment figures revealed that the proportion of young people unemployed (and not in full-time education) is now at a record low of 4.7% for our country - and far lower than for many other developed countries.It sends a significant message out about the drive and innovation of our young people, and the opportunities that our economy offers to them and their future.With our welfare changes this country can now be powered forward by this young generation.Since 2010, youth unemployment has fallen by over 45%, giving 130,000 more young people a job, and a future.Add the fact that wages are on the up and there are more than 829,000 vacancies nationwide, it’s clear that young people are entering the best jobs market in a decade.On average, the number of vacancies has increased by 4,280 each month over the last year, and those vacancies span from construction to technology.So when young people this week are deciding on their next steps, they can think big as there are plenty of opportunities out there for them, from a job with career progression, to taking up an apprenticeship.Look at Daisy, who turned down five university offers to work at global engineering firm JCB designing new equipment, and she didn’t have to go to university to get there.I’m forever being told, and intrinsically understand, that people want to study at different times in their lives, often inspired to do so when they see the practical benefits of their studies.That’s why so many people prefer, and do better, getting a job first and then studying for exams while they work.Even over the last few decades, how the world of education and work are linked has shifted dramatically. People no longer have one job for life, and lifelong learning is becoming more and more commonplace as people dip in and out of education.Many more people up-skill and retrain throughout their career – and this is how the future jobs market will remain vibrant and strong.And when I speak to employers up and down the country, from manufacturers to marketers, what they want are young people with the right attitude, prepared to work and learn. As they say, ‘if you’ve the will, we can give you the skill’.So when young people this week are deciding their next steps, the academic route isn’t the only option.You can now become a solicitor, an accountant or even a nuclear engineer through the apprenticeship route, earning as you learn and without the cost of going to University. Studying a Higher Apprenticeship gives an average wage boost of £150,000 over a working life.When I speak to young people around the country, I’m impressed with the confidence and self-assuredness with which they look to the future, and the range of options they consider beyond traditional routes.Im certainly no job snob. Life teaches you its not where you come from, its where you get to, and work is exactly the same.You can start anywhere and get to the top as Im repeatedly being told by our countrys top entrepreneurs.Top performers in their fields such as Debbie Moore, Jean-Christophe Novelli, Deborah Meaden and Jo Malone, did not go to university and are just a handful of the individuals who show that with drive and determination you can succeed by treading your own path.Its all about getting a break and taking the opportunities that come your way.So best of luck to everyone today, but whatever your results, there are many opportunities and pathways into a successful career.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If they go on to university they incur debts of over £50,000 and will be paying back their loans well into middle age. And in a number of cases they end up with degrees that dont get them into graduate jobs.On the other hand, degree-level apprenticeships are almost non-existent with less than 10,000 available each year compared with over 300,000 university places.

Here, we look at some of the key phrases and what they mean...A conditional offer means you still need to meet the requirements – usually exam results, according to the official UCAS website.An unconditional offer means youve got a place, although there might still be a few things to arrange.An unsuccessful or withdrawn choice removes that option, but you could add more.UCAS adds: Dont worry if you dont get any offers though – you might be able to add extra choices now, or look for course availability later on.The UCAS points calculator is a really helpful way of working out how many points you accumulated across your exams.All you have to do is enter the qualifications, subjects and grades you got - and it does the rest.The marks you got in one exam are converted to marks on a Uniform Mark Scale (UMS), according to A-Levels.Anything above 80% is an A grade, 70-79% offers a B grade, 60-69% is C, 50-59% is D and 40-49% offers you the bottom pass E grade.You can track your application by signing up to UCAS Track here. But contrary to popular belief, it does not update at midnight. So if you stayed up late to check you would have wasted your time.The service actually updates from 8am on A-level results day (August 16, 2018). If you check Track and it says your place is “unconditional” then well done youve been accepted.A university or college might offer you an alternative. This could be “a changed course offer” which you’ll need to accept or decline.Grade boundaries will be published from 8am on Thursday, August 16, 2018, and are available on each exam boards website.This is the same day as A-level results day, when pupils can go to their school or college to receive their marks.These boundaries show the minimum number of marks that students need for each grade.The grade boundaries are normally released online the day before candidates receive their GCSE and A-level results, but it has been changed to be published on the same day.TES reported that the decision to delay the publication of the grade boundaries was to prevent students from becoming overly anxious about their results and panicking that they would not achieve the necessary grade.It comes after the governments pledge in 2017 to toughen up the end of year exams was left in tatters - with the marks needed for top grades lowered to prevent a massive fall in results this summer."},{"url":null,"title":"rapper stormzy launches scholarship for two black kids to go to cambridge","story":"He will also cover the extra costs of studying at the world-renowned university.The news comes after it was revealed that some Cambridge colleges didnt take a SINGLE black student from 2012 - 2016.But Stormzy was keen to stress that its not the only route available for young people deciding what they want to do in live.He said today: “Luckily for myself when I was going through school, I had the academic ability.Back in 2016, he told students at the Oxford University Guild: You guys did something I couldn’t do, which is get sick A Level grades.

Well, you must have been getting your news from the BBC, then.This was the latest example of Corbyn simpering around terrorists. Honouring scumbags who massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich.The Black September gangsters castrated their male victims while they were still alive.But then, Corbyn was happy to attend the funerals of dead IRA terrorists. That’s the kind of chap he is. Actually, I say that was the “latest” case of Corbyn simpering around terrorists.Not quite. A day or two later a photo emerged of him giving the salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, a foul organisation proscribed as terrorists in six countries.And it’s all part of the anti-Semitism scandal which is tearing the Labour Party apart. An important story.Good people have left Labour as a consequence. The Jewish community in the UK is in uproar.Frightened of the far Left’s support for vile Islamists and its loathing of Israel and its right to exist.Scared of the morons who now lead Labour and its retinue of lefties who have said the most appalling, racist, stuff about Jews.Jeremy Corbyn, a genuine halfwit, thinks it is all “fake news”.He rolls his eyes when asked about it and gives different answers every time he is questioned.And guess who agrees with him? Yep, the BBC.The corporation refused to touch the story for a whole day, when it was first reported by blogger Guido Fawkes. Ignored it.Everyone else — including the left-wing  — thought it important.Instead, the front page of the BBC’s online news carried no fewer than SIX stories about former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the allegations of Islamophobia made against him. Six!Boris had likened women who wear the burka to letter boxes or bank robbers.The vast majority of the country agreed that he wasn’t being racist. The vast majority want the burka banned here — as it is in Denmark, France, parts of Germany, Belgium and . . . Morocco.His comments were not much of a story at all. And the moves to sanction him solely a case of his enemies in the Conservative Party gleefully hammering the bloke.But the BBC became obsessed by it. It is always obsessed when the word Islamophobia is mentioned.And it loves to stick the boot into the Tories. Yet was utterly silent on the latest example of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.It took them a full day to even mention the story.It’s another shocking case of the BBC’s bias. A left-liberal prejudice which runs right through the corporation from top to bottom.The same prejudice you hear whenever it deals with immigration (bloody marvellous!) or Brexit (absolutely ghastly!).Haven’t we had enough of this? Enough of paying £150.50 every year to have these credulous dupes pipe liberal propaganda into our homes every day.Get rid of the licence fee. Let the BBC survive through the subscriptions of those who are willing to pay. And on that deal, I’m out, Evan.Heres a photo of Rhian Sugden dressed as a plum.I’ve included it this week so that Tess Daly can enjoy it.Her husband, the uniquely interesting Vernon Kay, had a long sexting relationship with Rhian, apparently.And Tess was a bit hacked off.So maybe this will cheer her up.I’m on a diet. One of those low-carb things. God it’s boring.My favourite kinds of food are fat and carbohydrates, preferably mixed together.At night I dream of mashed potato and steak and kidney pudding.How can people enjoy life on a diet of bloody stir-fry?And the worst thing is it doesn’t seem to have done much for my weight. I still look like a pregnant middle-aged lesbian in a Boris Johnson wig.If the pounds don’t fall off soon I’m going to give it up. And BINGE.There’s a restaurant round my way that does a chicken parmo with a pizza on top.That’s where I’ll be heading.Freda Jackson, aged 81, did not enjoy her holiday and is demanding that the tour company refund her the full cost.Freda went on holiday to Spain and found herself surrounded by Spaniards...who wouldnt complain?Her complaint? The hotel she was staying in was “full of Spaniards”. Well, fair enough. They can be annoying. They get over-excited and spoil everyone’s fun.Where was Freda on holiday? Spain. Freda thinks she should have been warned about the possibility of being surrounded by Spaniards in Spain.She added that they should go “somewhere else” for their holidays.Brits are flooding to Turkey to take advantage of the crashing lira. You can get a holiday for two-fifths of nowt, apparently.All well and good. But you would have to pay me a lot of money to go anywhere near Turkey.The reason it’s cheap is because the moron who runs the place, Recep Erdogan has wrecked the economy.

So, no women, gays or Jews, please.”This job has come up because the previous leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi (Bob Baghdad to his mates) got hit in a drone strike. According to the Islamic State, he is now brain-dead. Hmmm. How could they tell?A year or so back I was in a minicab at night on my way home when we approached the level crossing near my house.The gates were open and the driver, a foreign bloke, drove into the middle, stopped and said: “Sorry, left or right?” I looked at him to see if he was joking.He wasn’t.

The 24-year-old was on a first date with web designer Jack Shepherd, whom she met online. He was trying to impress her with the champagne-fulled trip past the Houses of Parliament but drove at twice the speed limit, before the boat hit a log and tipped over. Shepherd, 30, went on the run instead of facing trial but was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in his absence and jailed for six years. His refusal to face justice has left Charli’s family grief-stricken, frustrated, and with endless unanswered questions about that night in December 2015. Here Charli’s older sisters Katie, 29, and Vicky, 31, from Dartford, Kent, write an open letter to Shepherd.   Dear Jack Shepherd,  We both want you to know the terrible impact losing Charli has had on our lives. Katie heard the news of her death after a morning teaching science to secondary school children. A colleague gave her the message: “Please call your mum – \u0026shysomething has happened to your sister.” She wondered if Vicky, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant, had her baby prematurely. But as soon as Katie heard mum’s sobs and words: “It’s Charli”, she said: “What has he done?” Call it intuition or a premonition, but somehow Katie just knew something had gone terribly wrong the night before. It began during your date when Charli started sending WhatsApp messages telling of the food you ate at the restaurant, and champagne on the speedboat.  That evening, Katie’s second last message to Charli said: “Please let me know you have you survived this \u0026shyescapade?” Charli didn’t answer. That night Katie couldn’t sleep. First thing the next day, she texted her concern: “Charli, are you alive?” That message wasn’t delivered to Charli’s phone, found in her pocket when they pulled her body from the river. Vicky was having a check up at the maternity hospital when she took mum’s call. She had a panic attack. Vicky remembers nothing except the sound of her own wailing. Hearing our baby sister was dead was the worst moment of our lives, until we had to identify her body. We went to the mortuary together with our parents, all hoping it wasn’t our Charli. As soon as we walked into the room and saw her, Mum and Vicky collapsed. Such deep trauma was dangerous for Vicky at such a late stage in pregnancy.  Her due date was December 29. But because of the distress caused by losing Charli, Vicky suffered a series of mini strokes and was admitted to hospital on December 20. She was induced for her and her baby’s safety, and because Charli’s funeral was planned for January 5 2016, and Vicky was terrified she’d go into labour as we said our final goodbyes. Because of you, Charli never met her gorgeous youngest nephew Edward, who was born on Boxing Day. Now Edward is two, the same age as your child who is growing up fatherless. Coming back to serve your time, and seeing your child, is surely better than a lifetime on the run, constantly looking over your shoulder? We urge you directly: give us answers and give yourself up. To any of your friends reading this, please know the net is closing in so you’re just delaying the inevitable. Jack, you’re young so facing justice and serving your time still gives you a chance of having a life, career and family.  Your reckless and cavalier attitude robbed Charli of that chance. But you can never take our memories of our glamorous, bubbly little sister. We remember Charli’s lovely confidence which made her comfortable meeting Vicky’s in-laws for the first time wearing huge rollers in her hair. We can laugh remembering her fearsome competitiveness playing crazy golf. We are both eaten up with anger about the loss of Charli, we both have an empty feeling of grief which feels like it will never end and a sense of living in constant shock. Our pain is indescribable. We were brought up as three very close sisters often mistaken for triplets and are now only two. At family Christmases, weddings and anniversaries we lay a place for Charli at the table. Seeing it empty makes every happy occasion sad. We spend Charli’s birthday at her grave. Time isn’t healing. We hurt just as much as we did in those first few weeks after Charli’s death. Our bereavement left us unable to function. Yet you married a woman you’d got pregnant within a month of the tragedy. We are stuck in an emotional fog because when you fled the court case, you stole our chance of closure and left us with unanswered questions.  You might expect us to lash out with threats or name-calling. But our family has too much dignity and decency. We know you don’t have a shred of either – because if you had a tiny speck of a conscience you’d have turned up at the Old Bailey to finally answer questions about the night you killed our sister. Instead, showing complete lack of respect for us and the legal system, you ran away. Your barrister excused your absence as cowardice. It’s also extreme arrogance and despicable selfishness. We wanted to hear what really happened that night you took Charli out on the Thames in a speedboat bought on Gumtree to “pull women”, as you smirkingly told police. Now we might never know. Why did you pester Charli for a date, tracking her down on Facebook after she blocked you on a dating site? When you knew of the dangerous debris in the Thames, why did you drive the boat at more than twice the speed limit in the dark?  Why take such risks while so drunk you didn’t know Charli’s name, or your own next of kin, when you were in the ambulance? We believe Charli would have survived if she had worn a life jacket. Why on earth didn’t you offer her one when you had two on board? So many questions. But our main one is: do you have any remorse? In the oppressively dark grief we searched for something good to come from Charli’s death. That has to be our petition to clarify and tighten laws covering dangerous driving and drinking while in control of a private boat. We won’t stop until we have at least 10,000 signatures so the Government will consider amending the very loose laws. Hopefully new rules will save lives and will one day be known as ‘Charli’s Law’.

No-one died. The terrorist was caught alive. There is no martyr, and if the worst they can do is smack their heads against a reinforced anti-terrorist barrier next to the most heavily-guarded building in Britain then, frankly, there\u0027s not a lot to lose sleep over.  Except there is, because as with every terror attack the hardest questions that must be asked are not, while official knees jerk to protect themselves.  Attacks on Parliament bring home to MPs that they are targets for those who take exception to their views, their politics or their existence. It\u0027s natural that after the second car-based attempt at mass murder on their place of work in 17 months, they would start to think that cars might be the problem. Only we don\u0027t say men are the problem, even though every single terror attack carried out on our shores of late has been conducted by people with testicles. The Islamists who have attacked us may have been Muslims, people of colour, slightly-thick zealots, and one-time petty criminals, but we have not and will not outlaw all such people for the crimes of a few. Boris Johnson would be stuffed, for a start. Yet some say it\u0027s time to pedestrianise Parliament Square. Because terrorists are never on foot, are they?   Terrorists have never been in cars, then got out of them to kill someone, have they?    Terrorists have never targeted places where all their potential victims are walking or sitting down, have they?   Terrorists are always the driver, aren\u0027t they?  Terror attacks often lead to changes, many of them useful. When the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel in Brighton it led to stringent security measures for party political conferences. After 6 were killed and 50 injured at the Westminster Bridge terror attack, Theresa May promised another \u0026pound50m for counter-terrorism, having earlier been criticised for cuts.  And let\u0027s not be too architecturally-conservative about Parliament Square. It was laid out only in 1868, around the same time as the Victorians rebuilt the Houses of Parliament. It is a space owned by the Greater London Authority, which has the power to make bylaws for it, and has used this power in recent years to repeatedly curb the right to protest.  While there is a right to assembly on any public highway, on the roads around Parliament you must ask for police permission. So, on the face of it, pedestrianising the area - putting even the roads under local authority control, banning cars which happens anyway for approved protests, and keeping weapons-on-wheels away from the seat of our democracy - may seem like a sound idea. But it isn\u0027t.  Manchester Arena is not a public space, is privately-owned, and keeps its concert-goers away from vehicles. Salman Abedi still managed to blow himself and 22 others to pieces, killing and injuring huge numbers of children.   Abedi used a backpack and a suitcase. Parliament Square attracts millions of tourists a year, most of them with backpacks and suitcases.  Perhaps police and politicians would like bollards at the entrance to the square to include x-ray scanners, to catch those carrying bombs or knives in their backpacks?  In which case, we can look forward to everyone with a penknife or nail scissors being stopped, liquids being bagged and belts and shoes removed at the entrance to the square, just as they already are when you attempt to enter Parliament itself. And anyone who wishes to stage a protest or go to the TV studios at Millbank to criticise the government, will not only have to seek formal approval but be questioned as to their purpose on the way in and the way out. At this uncomfortably-authoritarian juncture, it might be wise to remind ourselves of the few times in recent history that Parliamentarians have actually been attacked.  Jo Cox MP was shot and stabbed on the roadside in Birstall, West Yorkshire in 2016 while on her way to meet constituents.  Stephen Timms MP was stabbed twice at a constituency surgery in a library in Beckton, east London in 2010.  More recently, Conservative life peer David Prior was the victim of a pig blood-based graffiti attack in his own home by an angry ex-girlfriend. When a brick was thrown through Angela Eagle\u0027s office, Stella Creasy was threatened with rape and Jess Phillips given death threats, it happened either in their own constituencies or online. And who could forget when deputy Labour leader John Prescott was egged outside a theatre in Rhyl, north Wales, in 2001 when on his way to a political rally.  As yet, no Islamist has yet come within 10 yards of a Parliamentarian at Parliament. Those who have launched attacks outside have not got in, and it has become quite apparent that while cars are good at killing pedestrians, they are rubbish at getting past armed police officers, metal barriers and brick walls.  Of course a Parliamentarian could be outside on his bike, as others were yesterday, or walking over Westminster Bridge, or coming through the gate at the wrong time. So could any one of a thousand other humans, and it is not for the public\u0027s sake anyone has suggested banning vehicles.  It has been suggested purely to look like something is being done - even though that thing would not deter a single terrorist. We have yet to hear of an incident averted because a devoted Islamist saw a \u0027keep off the grass\u0027 sign. They are not known for being law-abiding, and it should be noted that this latest attack involved an illegal turn on the wrong side of the road, in clear contravention of the Highway Code.  You can say this for cars being used as weapons - they tend to at least keep the driver alive. And if you ask any counter-terrorism officer what he\u0027d like most after a terror attack, he\u0027d say someone to interrogate.  He might further point out that, in his ideal world, the terrorists come to him. They choose the most-guarded, secure and bristling-with-police-officers building in the country, and run at it one at a time, almost as though they were idiots.  Parliament is a place that can handle terror. Blocking it off to cars does not stop terrorists - it just moves them down the road, to Tesco or the Tower of London or Top Shop. And there isn\u0027t a person on the planet who can\u0027t see that an attack on soft targets is not only easier for even the most stupid of zealots to manage, but it\u0027ll kill an awful lot more people.   Pedestrianisation is the go-to solution for every politician from the local town hall to Downing Street. Banning cars is the only way they can think of to boost local cafes, cut pollution and, now, protect democracy. Never mind that business rates, car manufacturers and sanity might all have more to do with it.  The ability to drive, in cars, taxis or buses, and to walk or cycle unhindered, through Parliament Square does two important things. First, it means millions of us get to see the place close up. On visits, school trips, holidays, the daily commute and in tiny glimpses on our way to somewhere else, we are reminded it is there, and that it is ours. If it were pedestrianised it would be seen only by those who seek it out. And secondly, it tells the terrorists - these dense meat-sacks who could not in any other situation terrify a wet kitten - that we are unmoved. Our democracy has survived worse, and it will survive them.

More than 1.2 million businesses will be hit with a rates rise again in April, and the scale of the increase depends on what inflation stands at next month. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose to 2.5% last month. If it stays at that, businesses in England would see a \u0026pound758million surge in their rates bills next year, according to analysis by industry experts Altus Group. Of that, \u0026pound194million would fall on firms in the retail sector.  Robert Hayton, head of UK Business Rates at Altus Group, called on the Chancellor to take action. He said: “With our high streets engulfed in crisis, and Brexit uncertainty hurting manufacturers and the services industries, the Chancellor should be bold in his autumn Budget later in the year through an unprecedented stimulus by freezing rate rises.” Soaring business rates have battered high street stores already struggling to compete with online giants.  In a victory for our High Street Fightback campaign, the \u0026shyChancellor last week said he was considering an “Amazon tax” on online sales to help level the playing field. Mr Hammond also brought forward a switch from the Retail Prices Index to the lower CPI to calculate rates increases to April this year, saving firms \u0026pound2.3billion over five years. The amount raked in from business rates has surged by \u0026pound6billion in the last 10 years.

This right-wing Tory has an obsession with privatisation but the real way to restore the network is to run it as a key public service, owned and operated by Great Britain.  By slashing state investment, the austerity-obsessed Conservatives have left us with crowded, dirty trains which are too often late if they turn up at all.

Always on time, well organised and, based on all the conversations the Ku Klux Klan’s members had with him, a powerful advocate for their hateful racist politics. What they didn’t know was that Ron was a black police officer. In 1979, Officer Stallworth, then 29, spent a year infiltrating the KKK and exposing their links with the police, military and organised crime. His audacious scheme, which started when he saw an advert in his local paper asking for potential KKK members, has inspired what some critics have called “the most important film of the year”, BlacKkKlansman. But in many ways, the truth is even stranger than Spike Lee’s movie makes it out to be. Working as an intelligence officer for the Colorado Springs Police Department, Ron was the only black officer on the force. So he took the rising tide of racist violence very seriously. And when he answered that advert, picking up the phone to talk to local KKK organiser Ken O’Dell, Ron knew he was risking more than embarrassment if they found out who he was.  America was gripped by far-right terrorism in the 1970s. In 1971, KKK members used dynamite to blow up ten buses which were to be used to desegregate schools in Pontiac, Michigan. In the months when Ron was planning his scheme, five communist protestors demonstrating in a Death To The Klan march were killed by the KKK and the American Nazi Party in the Greensboro massacre in North Carolina. In 1980, four black women were shot in Chattanooga, Tennessee, after a KKK rally. Just six months, later Michael Donald, age 20, was lynched in Alabama, his body found hanging from a tree. With this kind of bigoted violence going on, it’s fair to say that Ron knew the kind of character he was supposed to be playing when trying to ingratiate himself with the KKK’s O’Dell. Ron said: “I eventually spoke with him over the phone responding to that ad, and he explained to me that he was starting a Klan chapter in Colorado Springs and was looking for new people. “So I told him that I was a white man, that I hated blacks, Jews, Mexicans, Asians. That I thought the white man had not gotten a fair deal in this country. “[That] I was really upset because my sister had dated a n***** and it offended me that his black hands had touched her white body. And, as a result, I wanted to join the group and do what I could to put a stop to all of this nonsense.”  That was all it took – Ron, who now lives in El Paso, Texas, with his wife, was in. But very quickly he knew he was going to get caught if he couldn’t solve a major problem. How could he, a black man, walk into the public meetings of a large and violent racist organisation dedicated to seeing him back in chains? He was fine dealing with them over the phone, but he knew that when it came to having face-to-face meet-ups, he couldn’t go himself. So he drafted in his friend, Chuck, who worked in the drug squad, to be Ron Stallworth in person. It was also at this point that Ron realised he had – perhaps shortsightedly – signed his own name on his first letter to the KKK. However, it wasn’t just the practical problems holding up Ron’s investigation. Senior officers took a while to be convinced of its merits. “They felt like they couldn’t lose investigators to a bunch of nonsense like ‘men running around in sheets’,” said Ron. But with no signs of America’s racial violence subsiding, senior officers eventually agreed. Ron arranged to meet O’Dell, who was a serving soldier, at a bar near Fort Carson military base. He sent Chuck in wearing a wire, and guided him through the tricky conversations. “That’s how we conducted this investigation over the next eight or nine months or so,” Ron said. “I did most of the talking on the phone with these individuals, and when it came time for physical contact, the face-to-face meeting, I would send the white officer in posing as me.”  After months of phone calls and secret meetings, the infiltration was going so well that, incredibly, O’Dell recommended that Ron be made the head of the Colorado Springs branch of the KKK. He was put in touch with the hate group’s leader, David Duke. At one point – clearly confident that his plan hadn’t been rumbled – he even asked the KKK’s leader about the threat of infiltration. Ron explained: “I said, aren’t you afraid of an undercover police officer infiltrating your organisation or maybe a black man calling you up and pretending to be white?” “He said no, he wasn’t fearful of that at all, because he could always tell when he was talking to a black person.” Pushing his luck, Ron asked how Duke knew that he wasn’t black. “He said, you don’t talk like a black man. You talk like a very smart, intellectual white man. I can tell by the way you pronounce certain words.” Then, in an incident that seems more like far-fetched movie plot than real life, Ron – in his role as a serving police officer, rather than an undercover agent – met Duke in person. He was tasked with protecting the so-called Grand Wizard while he delivered a racist rant in public. He said: “I went and introduced myself to David Duke without giving him a name and told him I would do everything I could to protect him, even though I didn’t agree with him. We shook hands and I became his bodyguard.” Ron’s investigation in many ways highlighted his worst-possible fears. He found Klansmen in all walks of life, from local shop owners to school teachers and his neighbours.

This week watchdogs banned it from claiming that it can guarantee next-day delivery for customers using its Amazon Prime service. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the claim misleading because “a significant proportion of Prime labelled items were not available for delivery by the subsequent day”. Amazon has also faced a storm over complaints that it\u0027s not paying its fair share of tax. Earlier this month the Mirror revealed that it paid just \u0026pound4.6million last year despite UK sales soaring by a quarter to \u0026pound8.8billion. British retailers with similar UK sales paid up to 20 times as much tax. Now one business seller using the service is claiming that Amazon allows cheating customers to unfairly get chargebacks. SaveMyLight sells lighting components and claims that Amazon has a policy of refunding buyers “at the drop of a hat to keep them happy”. The Midlands-based retailer says its customers have been refunded even when they don\u0027t return goods, or return goods that have clearly been damaged while in use, and some have even got refunds after returning goods that SaveMyLight does not sell. “The chargeback procedure on Amazon is in chaos and being continually abused with more and more buyers exploiting this now openly known loophole - buy goods, file chargeback, get money back, keep goods,” says sales manager Steven Williams. “Amazon are complicit in this by not ensuring goods are returned as per the Consumer Rights Act and instead wish to keep their buyers happy by simply removing funds from our seller account. “There are many other Amazon sellers affected and for us this has been going on for years.” He says that the problem is made worse by the difficulty in communicating with Amazon, with emails being unanswered. “If you telephone Amazon Support the call is answered by a Philippines operator who cannot assist,” he complains.

Nicholas Keith Warner, who arrived in Ireland last week, appeared at Limavady Magistrate’s Court charged with attempting to murder three men, two of them aged in their 30s and one aged in his 60s.  The three men each sustained stabbing injuries in an incident outside a bar at Main Street in the Co Antrim village of Ballycarry last Saturday night.  Warner, an electrical engineer from Morrow Lane in Summerville, South Carolina, denies attempting to murder the three men and he also denies assaulting a fourth man. The defendant further denies causing an affray but he admits possessing a knife.  The defendant, who sustained a broken leg in the incident, was helped by two police officers as he walked on crutches from a cell van on Main Street, Limavady, into the courthouse for his remand appearance. His wife Kaylee, a nurse also from South Carolina, sat behind her husband as he sat in the dock during the hearing. When asked by the court clerk if he understood the charges, the defendant replied “yes mam”. A detective constable told Deputy District Judge Ted Magill that he believed he could connect the defendant to the charges and he said alcohol was an issue in the case. Defence solicitor David Jones told the court that bail conditions proposed by the police and by the Public Prosecution Service were acceptable to the defendant.  “He accepts he was the individual who caused the injuries. From the moment of his arrest prior to his interviews he accepted he possessed the knife to defend himself”, Mr Jones said. “This case will come down to the argument of reasonable force or otherwise and because he is a US citizen I would request that if possible the case could be fast tracked. It is regrettable in that he is here on his honeymoon and his employment as an electrical engineer is now is jeopardy”, Mr Jones added. The defendant was released on his own bail of \u0026pound1,000 to appear at Ballymena Magistrate’s Court on September 6.

Using information compiled by \u0027s data department, we can reveal the best and worst performing schools.  Wembley High Technology College in Brent, London is the top school in England, while Cockshut Hill Technology College, Birmingham, has ranked last.   In Wales, Bishop Of Llandaff Church In Wales High School in Cardiff tops the rankings.  This is the sixth edition of the Real Schools Guide which is the most comprehensive guide ever on state-funded secondaries. The unique rating system uses 51 different measures, put together from the latest publicly-available data and broken into four categories – attainment, teaching, attendance, and outcomes. While national league tables may only examine GCSE results, the Real Schools Guide looks at schools which help all students to make progress, even if they only get slightly better than average exam scores overall.   See below to search for your school   Even those that include the new Progress 8 measure may overlook schools helping all pupils do well. The ranking system aims to give parents a better idea of which schools will help their child prosper, no matter what their background may be. The guide shows interesting trends with 80 per cent of the top 20 schools in England based in London and the South East.  What do you think of your school\u0027s performance? Email webnews@mirror   Four our of the top five schools in England are based in London. Just four of the schools are from the north and midlands with two form Lancashire, and one each from Liverpool and Reading. As well as this, girls-only secondaries make up half of the top performing schools in England\u0027s top 20.    In Wales\u0027 top 20, a quarter of the top schools are based in Cardiff while 25 per cent of the worst secondaries are in Flintshire. The top two worst performing schools in Wales, Glyn Derw High School and Michaelston Community College, both in Cardiff, were closed last summer to make way for the new Cardiff West Community High School. Other factors are also included in the data such as whether all pupils are making progress, attendance rates, the ratio of teachers to pupils, school finances, and whether students go on to further education or jobs. Attainment is worth 30 per cent of the total score. This is based on pupils’ Attainment 8, EBacc and GCSE performance in 2017.   Whether a school is getting top marks and if its GCSE results are improving year-on-year is also measured. Progress is worth 40 per cent of the score and is based on how well all as well as different types of pupil do in comparison to expectations and how well the school does at closing the gender gap. It also looks at how big the pupil/teacher ratio is in comparison to the national average, as well as teachers’ average salaries. The attendance score is based on absence rates, looking at both overall levels of sessions missed as well as unauthorised and persistent absence at the school. It is worth 15 per cent of the total score. Outcomes is also worth 15 per cent, and is based on what proportion of pupils continue with education, employment or training after Year 11, and what proportion leave employment, education or training within three months - in comparison to the national average.  Schools that had no Year 11 pupils taking Attainment 8 qualifying subjects in 2017 are not rated.  Speaking about Wembley High Technology College topping the list, Cllr Amer Agha, Brent Council’s Cabinet Member for Schools, Employment and Skills, said:     “Our aim is to ensure that every child in Brent has the best start in life possible, and so having one of our schools recognised as the best in the country, is hugely satisfying and testament to the hard work that’s been put in by everyone at the school.        “Coming a month after the council’s best-ever Ofsted rating and a few months after a Brent teacher won the Global Teacher Prize, this is another great day for Brent’s young people and I offer my sincere thanks and congratulations to all those involved.” The unique rating system uses 50 different measures, put together from the latest publicly-available data and broken into four categories - attainment, progress, attendance, and outcomes. National league tables may only look at overall GCSE results, as well as newer measures. Attainment This is worth 30 per cent of the total score. It is based on pupils\u0027 average grade attainment score, including what the average scores for different groups of pupils were, as well as the proportions gaining the English Baccalaureate and those getting A* to C grades in GCSE subjects. It measures whether a school is getting top marks, and if it is managing to improve year-on-year. Progress This is worth 40 per cent of the score. It is based on how well different types of pupil do in terms of progressing. It also looks at things that may contribute to teaching outcomes, such as how big the pupil/teacher ratio is in comparison to the national average, as well as teachers\u0027 average salaries. Attendance This score is based on absence rates, looking at both overall levels of sessions missed as well as unauthorised and persistent absence at the school.

Freda Jackson, 81, said she cried at the end of her two-week trip and that the hotel she stayed in was full of Spanish holidaymakers. The grandmother, from Blackburn, Lancashire, went on to complain that the Spanish guests at the Poseidon Playa hotel were rude and that the evening entertainment was all focused and catered for the Spanish. Now, locals have hit back at the pensioner, saying she needs to scrub up on her geography skills next time she plans to take a trip abroad.  After the story appeared on Spanish news site Marca , one reader said: We should remind the good lady that Benidorm is in Spain.  Another said: If she hates Spain so much...why is she coming. It seems it would be good to learn some geography.  Freda had booked her Benidorm holiday in April 2017 after claiming travel operator Thomas Cook had recommended the hotel. But despite her request for ground access flat, Freda and her 61-year-old friend were placed on a slope instead. Grandmother-of-six Freda and her friend paid a total of \u0026pound1,133 for the holiday and have demanded a full refund or a free trip. Freda said: I have never complained about a holiday before - but this one was a disaster from start to finish. She added: My friend and I paid for it from our pensions and it was a struggle trying to fund it over 12 months and the holiday was totally ruined - I cried after. The hotel was full of Spanish holidaymakers and they really got on our nerves because they were just so rude.  One evening a Spanish guy nearly knocked me flying and he just walked off without even apologising. The entertainment in the hotel was all focused and catered for the Spanish - why can\u0027t the Spanish go somewhere else for their holidays? Freda claims her requests for specific flats in the hotel were ignored and the operator failed to inform them of a change to the flights. She added: We wanted to go somewhere on flat ground and not in the hills because we have mobility issues. To top it off once we got to reception they told us we had been put on the 14th floor, thankfully we were moved to the second floor, and that it was 42 steps down to the hotel\u0027s swimming pool. The pair travelled 1,500 miles from Manchester Airport to Alicante on May 10, after not being notified by Thomas Cook that the dates of their flights had changed. Freda, who has previously visited Greece, Turkey, Portugal and Tenerife, claims Thomas Cook \u0027mis-sold\u0027 and \u0027ruined\u0027 her dream holiday.

Developer Paul Mager said he didn\u0027t know the underground pipe was there until after the two-storey, detached house was already built. He decided to matters into my own hands and tear down the house in Tetney, Lincolnshire, amid a row with Anglian Water that he didn\u0027t think he would win.  But it could only be the start of his trouble, as the local council says it received no prior approval for the demolition work, Grimsby Live reports.   Bulldozers moved in to demolish the executive house on Wednesday morning, sparking bemusement from neighbours. Mr Mager said the construction work could have ruptured the main, which serves homes across Cleethorpes and Waltham, leading to a major disaster. The head of Mager Homes Limited said: The detached house that is as we speak coming down has been built on the main water main from the Tetney Blow Wells. So that detached house has been built on the main water main artery that runs into Waltham and Cleethorpes. So to cut a long story short, having tried to do a deal with Anglian Water, it became apparent that the best thing to do was to take it down and re-site it.  It\u0027s a bit more complicated than that. But I have had a major row with Anglian Water and it looks like I was going to lose so I took matters into my own hands. Built on top of a main taking water from Tetney Blow Wells nature reserve, the house has never been occupied. It was approved in 2016 by East Lindsey District Council as part of an application for seven properties on Humberston Road. Mr Mager said: In order to avert that puncture taking place, the quickest thing was to take it down in order to avoid any damage to Anglian Water property. That little corner will be flattened and we will resubmit a planning application to redevelop in a different way.

The massive stack of hay has been piled up on trailers in a field adjacent to the back gardens of several \u0026pound500,000 detached properties. Villagers believe they were put there deliberately after a planning application by farmer Richard Barton to run a waste processing site was rejected. But Mr Barton has defended the move, accusing neighbours of making a straw mountain out of a molehill. Among those affected was resident Peter Shaw, 55, who said the bales were stacked behind his house on Cole Road, Ockbrook, Derbyshire, last Thursday.  Mr Shaw and his wife Helen, 50, moved into the home in 2004, and say this is the first time they have encountered an issue with Mr Barton. Mr Shaw, who works in the motoring trade, says the bales are a potential fire risk and is urging Mr Barton, 44, to remove them. He said: The farmer won\u0027t speak to you, I have tried. He\u0027s just a bully. I truly believe it is just something we are going to have to live with now. I have contacted everyone and anyone that I possibly can and nothing seems to getting done about it.  It feels as though there is one rule for one person and another rule for others. It\u0027s an eye sore - I\u0027m not sure they are even stored correctly. He\u0027s put 30 tons on a trailer. First, the lorries came and they were full of hay bales and he put them in place one by one. So we\u0027ve got three in a row. More and more bales were put on top - there might be a row of seven or eight - I\u0027m not entirely sure now. You can see it from the road, you can see it from the footbridge.  It\u0027s about ten meters from my home - if they were to fall then they would destroy my garden. I thought they were a fire risk but the fire brigade said to me they\u0027re not a fire risk. The farmer has been trying to put a planning application through now for the past eight years. He wants to create a site to process waste. The application has been rejected not just by ourselves but by the whole village. It just seems because my house backs onto his farm - that we have to bear the brunt of this. Another resident on the street said: The view from our back garden used to be open fields but now all you can see is a wall of hay.  I\u0027m convinced this is some kind of protest against the village because the farmer didn\u0027t get the planning permission he wanted. It\u0027s a form of intimidation and is just simply being done out of spite. Speaking from his farm in Ockbrook, Derbys., where he lives with wife Samantha, 50, he said: It\u0027s got nothing to do with the planning application for a waste processing site. Where am I supposed to put my bales? They [the residents] are selfish - all they think about is themselves. All they want to see is green land but I don\u0027t even get that view and its my farm. I\u0027ve got my property here, I can\u0027t put them [hay bales] on my drive because there\u0027s no space - I\u0027ve got sheds in the way too. There\u0027s a dual carriageway on the other side I can\u0027t put them there. He added: They\u0027re making a straw mountain out of a molehill. I put them in the middle of the field and they complained about that and the council told me to move them. Now I\u0027ve moved them they\u0027re complaining again.

The 36-year-old, who has not been named, had taken Viagra the night before the accident.  According to the British Medical Journal , the man expected its effects to have worn off after sex, but resorted to \u0027vigorous masturbation\u0027 when it failed to do so.  The following morning, the Viagra was continuing to work, before his child jumped on the bed in an attempt to wake him, but \u0027mistakenly fell over his erect penis\u0027, according to King George’s Medical University.  The journal goes on to explain how the man, from India, developed \u0027sudden severe pain in his penis and lost tumescence\u0027 - the build up of blood. After two days in agonising pain, he reported himself to doctors who confirmed a tear in his corpora cavernosa - the tissue that stores blood during an erection. His penis was said to be deformed and swollen from the injury.

Jacob Meir Abdellak called police reporting a bomb on board the Norwegian flight from London Gatwick to Los Angeles just eight minutes before it was due to depart.  A full re-screening by security staff at the airport meant the flight was delayed by 90 minutes on May 11. Investigations by Gatwick Airport staff revealed that Abdellak, 47, was significantly late for his flight and he was denied boarding before becoming abusive to airline staff. He was told to return on another date to rearrange his flight.  Police soon discovered the phone call used to make the hoax threat was the same number linked to Abdellak\u0027s flight booking. He was charged with communicating false information regarding a noxious substance likely to create serious risk to human health, however he denied the offence throughout. Abdellak, a French national, admitted the telephone number was his, but claimed he had lost the SIM card a few days earlier and therefore the call could not have been made by him.  But at Lewes Crown Court yesterday, when the trial was due to begin, the librarian changed his mind and pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment and required to pay a \u0026pound140 victim surcharge. Gatwick Police Chief Inspector Marc Clothier said: “This was a quite ridiculous decision made by Abdellak, who fabricated an extremely serious allegation purely for his own benefit. He was running late for his flight and thought it would be a good idea to call in a hoax bomb, however this turned out to be the worst decision he could have made.

DeeAnn Fitzpatrick, 49, accused fellow fisheries workers of mocking and targeting her in a campaign of sexist harassment. The Canadian woman claimed a racist and misogynistic culture within the Marine Scotland office in Scrabster drove her to contemplate suicide. But an employment tribunal has rejected her claims despite a photo showing her gagged and taped to a chair appeared to back up her claims, the Daily Record reports. That evidence was time-barred.  In an earlier hearing in Aberdeen in June, Ms Fitzpatrick alleged she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010. The tribunal heard how she was bombarded with fake Valentine\u0027s Day and birthday cards she believed came from male colleagues A message in one called her an “old troll” and another warned her about trying to “climb the ladder of success”. Ms Fitzpatrick told the tribunal the harassment was so bad she considered taking her own life and contacted an assisted suicide clinic. She told the tribunal: “When I first started getting the cards, it made me feel awful. But as they continued, yes it’s affected my self-esteem. “It’s actually made me become a recluse - I stay at home, I have gone more into myself. With everything going on, I contacted Dignitas in Switzerland. I had enough.” Ms Fitzpatrick, who has worked for Marine Scotland since 2006, was struggling to grasp the tribunal’s verdict.  She said on Wednesday night: “It is difficult when you spend your entire career fighting racism, misogyny and bullies. “Then to make matters worse when you report the incidents, you are the one that is being targeted by an ongoing campaign by senior management because you exposed what they have worked very hard to hide.” The Scottish Government put up one witness, Judith MacKinnon, its head of people advice, who has over 25 years experience in human resources. MacKinnon took up the job last year but said those who dealt with Ms Fitzpatrick’s complaints were too scared to appear because of the intense media interest.  But she backed the decisions taken by junior staff who found insufficient evidence to back up Ms Fitzpatrick’s suspicions about the letters. However First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs she was “absolutely horrified” when shown the photo of Ms Fitzpatrick allegedly taped to a chair and gagged. She has ordered a top civil servant to conduct a full review into the circumstances and report to her personally. Ms Fitzpatrick’s sister-in-law Sherry said: “The Fitzpatrick family are hugely disappointed with the result of the tribunal.

More than half a million students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their long-awaited grades in the wake of major exam reforms. And initial Ucas data shows 411,860 have taken up places on British degree courses so far this year - down one per cent on the same point last year. These students are both from the UK and overseas.  A breakdown shows 353,960 UK students have been accepted on to undergraduate courses, down 2 per cent on 2017. It follows a drop in applications to start degrees at British universities this autumn, fuelled by various factors including a fall in the country\u0027s 18-year-old population.   A Level results day 2018: All you need to know when you get your grades and what to do next  In England, there have been huge reforms to A-Level qualifications - with a move away from coursework and modular exams. Instead, sixth formers sit their exams at the end of two years of study. This year, around one in four entries were expected to be awarded the highest grades - with possible marks going up to an A*. And this morning, it emerged one teenage boy from South Yorkshire has achieved a clean sweep of five A* grades in the exams. Jack Parkinson, from Thorne, near Doncaster, is now set to fulfil a childhood dream of studying at Cambridge University after gaining the grades. He will read computer science after his top performance in mathematics, further mathematics, computer science, physics and the extended project qualification. The 18-year-old, who was encouraged by staff at Trinity Academy to apply for Cambridge, attended summer schools there and at Oxford.    He said: They gave me a taste of the way of life there and the people were really down to earth, which I was surprised by. While many students hoping to go to a university or college of their choice will get the grades they need today, others will inevitably be left disappointed. But The Grand Tour presenter Jeremy Clarkson told them not to worry. He tweeted: Don’t worry if your A level grades aren’t any good. I got a C and 2 Us. And I’m sitting here deciding which of my Range Rovers to use today. University leaders have suggested that there could be more people who are using Clearing this year to apply to university for the first time. Last year, 26.3% of A-levels scored an A or A*, national figures showed. The results are likely to be broadly similar again this year. They come in the wake of the massive exam reforms. There have been major reforms to A-Level qualifications in England - with a move away from coursework and modular exams.  Instead, sixth formers sit their exams at the end of two years of study. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: We reformed A-levels after universities told us they were failing to prepare students for higher education. Reducing the number of exams students have to sit will give them more time for study and to gain a deeper understanding of the courses they are studying, an essential skill for undergraduate study. We know exam season can be a time of heightened emotions for pupils wanting to do their best but while testing has always been an important part of education, it should never be at the expense of a young person\u0027s wellbeing. That\u0027s why the Government is investing \u0026pound1.7 billion to promote, protect and improve young people\u0027s mental health. Last year, the first grades were awarded in the first 13 subjects to be reformed in England and, among these subjects alone, the proportion of entries scoring at least an A grade fell by 0.7 percentage points to 24.3%. A further 11 subjects have been reformed with the first grades awarded today. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the redesign of A-levels would make them more appropriate, better (at) preparing young people for moving on to the next stage, including university. He told Today: Having exams at the end of the two years means that it is possible to consider the subject as a whole, to bring in all the different parts of it, to synthesise the different aspects of the subject in a way that is a little closer to undergraduate study. But Amanda Brown, deputy general secretary of the National Education Union, argued that A-level changes means that students are unable to fully demonstrate what they can do. Changing the assessment of A-levels so they focus on high-stakes exams taken at the end of two years of study does not allow students to properly demonstrate their ability and puts them under huge pressure, she said. You can find out all you need to know about getting your grades here   Students need to get around 55% of the answers right in their Biology A-level in order to secure an A grade, grade boundaries for one exam board suggest. The A grade pass mark required for the reformed OCR advanced Biology A-level is 54.8%, the figures on its website show. Those wanting an A in the reformed maths exam would need to get 65.6% of the answers right. Meanwhile, students who sat the English language A-level would be looking for 77% of the marks in order to secure an A. Coursework and other non-exam assessments are a better way for students to demonstrate their skills, are less of a memory test, and help lower attaining students and those with special educational needs and disabilities show their achievements. One expert suggested that the proportion of top grades could drop slightly, by less than a percentage point, due to changes to the exam system, and a major hike in the number of unconditional offers handed out by universities. Mitigating this are a number of factors, including processes put in place by England\u0027s exams regulator Ofqual to ensure that results are comparable and the first cohorts of students to take new courses are not disadvantaged, Professor Alan Smithers of the University of Buckingham said. For those looking for degree places through Clearing this summer, there are suggestions that they are likely to find it is a buyers\u0027 market. A Press Association survey shows that, as of yesterday, 26,350 undergraduate courses were showing up on the Ucas clearing website for students in England. Nine in 10 UK institutions have at least one course listed in Clearing, the survey found.  It also shows that three quarters of Russell Group universities, often considered among the best in the country, have at least one course in Clearing, with almost 4,500 courses listed in total. The numbers of courses listed change frequently as different courses are filled, or become available. At the same point last year, the day before results day, there were around 27,715 undergraduate courses in total listed on Clearing with potential availability for students in England. Professor Alex Neill, vice-president for education at the University of Southampton, said that, nationally, there may be fewer people in Clearing this year for a variety of reasons, including a decline in the population of school leavers. But he added that there could be more people in Clearing who have not applied to university through the main application scheme. As part of a further trend that\u0027s developed over the last few years, we do expect to see more students in Clearing who haven\u0027t previously applied to university so an increase in the number of people who are, in fact, using Clearing as their entry to university, he said.  We have evidence that prospective students are receiving advice not to make a decision or application \u0027early\u0027, in the Ucas cycle, but use Clearing as a time when they will still be able to get entry to a high quality university and a high quality course, keeping their options open rather than pinning themselves down early. Lindsay Neil, director of admissions at the University of Westminster, said: Traditionally, prospective students apply to universities, receive offers and choose their first and second choice. They then have a long wait for their results to see if they have been successful or not. If unsuccessful students would then use Clearing as a back-up option to find universities who have courses with vacancies. Now however, the demographics are changing. The number of 18-year-olds applying for university is at a low point creating a \u0027buyers\u0027 market\u0027. The majority of universities now open at least some courses in Clearing and this gives students a big advantage.

In total, 26.4 per cent of UK entries were given one of the two top grades, according to data published by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ). This is up 0.1 percentage points on last year. However, figures also show that the proportion of A-Levels handed the very top result has fallen to its lowest level since 2013. One in 12 (8.0%) entries scored an A* grade this year, down 0.3 percentage points on 2017, statistics published by the council show.  The overall A*-E pass rate has also fallen 0.3 percentage points to 97.6%. This is the lowest level since 2010.   A Level results day 2018: All you need to know when you get your grades and what to do next  But the percentage of A-Levels awarded an A or A* is the highest since 2012, according to a Press Association analysis. It is the second year in a row that the A*-A pass rate has risen. Boys continue to outperform girls at the highest grades, the figures show. While 26.6% of boys\u0027 entries were awarded at least an A grade this year, this was the case for 26.2% of girls\u0027 entries. The statistics also show that STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) are continuing to rise in popularity. More than a third (36.2%) of all A-level entries were in these subjects, up from 34.5% last year, and 28% in 2009.  Male students are still more likely to study a STEM subject than females, but the balance is shifting, JCQ said. More girls take biology and chemistry than boys, while more boys take maths and physics. But the data also shows that girls are closing in on the boys, with a 3.1% increase in maths entries from female students (boys\u0027 entries for the subject have risen 2.1%) and a 6.9% rise in physics (2.4% for boys). More than half a million students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are finding out their A-Level results today after an anxious wait. It comes in the wake of a major exams overhaul - with 24 A-level subjects now reformed.

Grades have been awarded for the first time this summer for new A-levels in languages, geography, dance, drama and theatre, music, PE and religious studies. They join the 13 A-level subjects for which the first grades were handed out last summer. Maths is in the process of being reformed and a small number of grades were handed out for the new qualification this summer. Most students have been awarded grades after studying the old A-level course. Overall, the subject is still the most popular A-level, with 2,383 more entries this year compared to 2017. Michael Turner, JCQ director general, said: Students, and teachers, should be congratulated. They can be confident in their grades, knowing they have been achieved in a world-class system that is robust, challenging and fair.  It comes as early figures have showed there has been a fall in the number of students accepted on degree courses at UK universities. In total, 411,860 students - from the UK and overseas - have taken up places, according to initial data published by admissions service Ucas. This is down 1% compared with the same point last year A breakdown shows 353,960 UK students have been accepted on to undergraduate courses, down 2% on 2017. But there is an increase in international students, with 26,400 EU applicants accepted to study at UK universities - up 1% on last year. And a record 31,510 students from nations outside the EU have taken up places - a 4% increase. The figures are a snapshot taken by Ucas shortly after midnight.    The admissions service said that in England, a record 27.9% of the 18-year-old population has been accepted on to courses, with a record 26.3% in Wales. In Northern Ireland, the entry rate is 28.1%, while in Scotland - where results were published last week - 25.9% of 18-year-olds have been accepted. Clare Marchant, Ucas chief executive, said an increase in the proportion of youngsters from disadvantaged background was excellent news. Some 16.1% of those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds have been accepted - up 0.4 percentage points. She added: However, the continuing gap between the most and least advantaged is frustrating, and we\u0027ll keep on working with universities to help them evaluate their outreach activities to impact the most disadvantaged students. The encouraging growth in international students choosing to study in the UK is testament to the welcome of our world-class universities.

The ex-Hollywood lighting director, 74, has told pals he expected Meghan , Samantha and Thomas Jr to help pay for his retirement but complained he had not received a “f***ing dime”. It comes after his ex-wife Doria Ragland was reportedly preparing to move to London to be close to her daughter, 37, and son-in-law Harry, 33. One source told the Daily Mirror: “While he was working, Tom supported all his children. He was generous.  “But he made no secret that he expected in his dotage the money he spent on them would be repaid. “He says they have not given him a f***ing dime back. He is growing increasingly bitter about it, and it has not been helped by how his ex-wife, Meghan’s mum, has been so welcomed into the royal fold. The fact she could be moving to England has not helped the situation while he is in a pokey home in Mexico.” Mr Markle has already revealed he had expected Meghan to look after him. He said: “I took care of my mother for the last five years of her life. “My daughter said she’d take care of me in my declining years. I’m not talking money, I’m talking about taking care of me. That’s important to me.”  However, the Duchess of Sussex and her dad have been estranged for three months. Matters came to a head when Mr Markle slammed the phone down on Harry during a heated phone call. The row came after Mr Markle was found to have lied to his soon-to-be \u0026shyson-in-law by denying colluding with a paparazzi to cash in on staged pictures days before the May 19 wedding. This was the latest in a stream of “dad disappointments” Meghan is said to have endured since she left home to go to university. However, we can reveal Mr Markle’s resentment over money is what initially drove a wedge between him and his children after he retired seven years ago. The Emmy winner, who worked on smash hit sitcom Married With Children, is said to have earned more than six figures each year during his career.  He also reportedly won $750,000 on the California State Lottery in 1990. Mr Markle gifted cash from the windfall to all his children while funding Meghan’s private education. After retiring, he moved from LA to Mexico, in part because of the cheaper lifestyle. Today he rents a $695-a-month – \u0026pound500 – home in Rosarito close to the US border. Despite cutting his costs, he declared himself bankrupt in California in 2016, with \u0026pound24,181 in credit card debts and savings of just \u0026pound160. Meanwhile, friends say Mr Markle is angry that Meghan’s mother has apparently been treated more favourably by the Royal Family than he has. Although the Prince has yet to meet his father-in-law, Doria has seen Harry on several occasions.  The 61-year-old yoga teacher has maintained a dignified silence since news of Meghan’s relationship with Harry emerged two years ago.

His longest relationship was with school pal Chelsy Davy, who he was with on and off for seven years before their split in 2011. It was reportedly Prince William and Kate Middleton\u0027s wedding which was the final straw for Chelsy, and it made her realise life of a royal wife just wasn\u0027t for her.  But Harry and jewellery designer Chelsy, 32, have remained close friends, and she was even invited to his wedding back in May .  And it turns out his new bride Meghan also has a very strange connection to her in her own right.   Chelsy is now dating James Marshall, and the couple were spotted enjoying a cosy lunch date just days after the royal wedding .  James has been married previously, and his ex-wife is writer and model Elettra Wiedemann, who is the granddaughter of Hollywood legend Ingrid Bergman.  Bizarrely, Elettra is actually really good pals with Meghan and the pair have been photographed at several events together. Elettra also wrote an expert travel guide to Paris for the duchess\u0027s lifestyle blog The Tig.  Chelsy was a guest at Prince William and Kate Middleton\u0027s wedding in 2011, even though she was no longer in a relationship with Harry. Before the big day he reportedly read her his best man\u0027s speech to her over the phone to see what she thought of it. Writing in royal biography Harry: Conversations with the Prince, journalist Angela Levin said: A friend revealed that seeing the enormity and pomp of the day convinced Chelsy that she and Harry had been right to separate.

The Prince of Wales may change his name when he becomes monarch, according to Queen\u0027s former spokesman Dickie Arbiter. The first-in-line to the throne may instead change his official title to one of his middle names - a royal tradition that dates back generations. “He might choose one of his other names Philip, Arthur or George”, Arbiter told HELLO! magazine. Monarchs often assume new titles when they they become King or Queen, including the Queen\u0027s father King George VI. George VI was baptised Albert Frederick Arthur George - after his great-grandfather Prince Albert - and was called Bertie by those closest to him. King Edward VII’s Christian name was also Albert.  King Edward VIII used his original name but used his final middle name David with close friends and family Arbiter also revealed that Charles will inherit a host of royal titles when he takes the throne, including Duke of Lancaster, Defender of the Faith, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, Head of the Commonwealth, and King of other Realms and Territories.  He told Hello Magazine : Charles will also be Lord of the Man (Isle of Man) and Duke of Normandy.  “But generally he\u0027ll only be known as King.  Wills and Kate may also change their titles when Charles becomes king. Currently known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the happy couple, both 36, could also gain two other royal titles. According to royal expert Marlene Koenig, the pair might inherit Charles\u0027 titles once he takes the throne. Speaking to HELLO! Magazine Marlene explained that while William will always be HRH Duke of Cambridge, he may end up being styled as HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge.

Diana\u0027s look for her big day is one that has gone down in fashion history, with her large princess dress made of ivory silk taffeta inspiring brides across the planet.  But it\u0027s recently been revealed that the 20-year-old princess-to-be could have walked down the aisle in a very different outfit.   According to People , the designers of her wedding gown, David and Elizabeth Emanuel , had made a second wedding dress for Diana - and it was kept so heavily under wraps that even the bride didn\u0027t know it existed.  A lot of effort went in to keeping the dress out of the public eye before the big day, with the designers even going as far as to destroy their sketches straight after they\u0027d been shown to Diana. But in case the design for the original were to be leaked, another dress was created as a back-up option. At the time we wanted to make absolutely sure that the dress was a surprise, said David.  We didn’t try it on Diana. We never even discussed it. We wanted to make sure that we had something there it was for our own peace of mind, really. So Diana never even saw the second dress which was made from the same fabric as the first and also featured ruffles around the neck. However there were a few big differences between the two. The secret dress was a lot less lavish than the original version, lacking the antique lace and 10,000 mother-of-pearl sequins as well as the 25-foot train.

Warm and humid conditions are expected in parts of the country after days of cloudy and rainy weather brought a welcome break from extreme heat. Temperatures peaked at 35.3C in Faversham, Kent on July 26 as summer heat records fell across the country. Hot weather is set to return to the UK in the coming days and it could carry on into September, according to forecasts.  Until then, parts of Britain will see some miserable weather. Parts of northwest England and Scotland are braced for heavy downpours with up to 30mm of rain expected in some locations before the end of this week. But the chance of pressure building next week could bring a return to more pleasant, settled weather.    However, there is still a risk of showers or longer spells of rain further north - despite the improving picture. Fresh breezes are possible while the rain continues but there will be some respite, with occasional brighter and drier intervals likely, especially as the weekend progresses. In the south and east more dry weather will bring mainly brighter, sometimes sunny, periods. This could create some warm and humid conditions especially when the sun shines.

Typically it ends up with something embarrassing being posted on our social media or a whole load of weird and wonderful photos being added to your camera roll. But for one woman in Arizona, handing over her phone resulted in a rather large sum of her money being spent, without her knowledge. And it turns out the person who scammed her, was none other than her six-year-old daughter Kaitlin.   The day before the incident, Kaitlin\u0027s mum had let the child order a Barbie doll off of her Amazon account as a special treat.  Later on, the young girl had asked to borrow the phone to check on the delivery status of the doll. Her mum, being a trusting person, was happy to oblige her daughter\u0027s request.  But it turns out Kaitlin had an ulterior motive for wanting to go on Amazon .   The six-year-old decided to treat herself to $300 (\u0026pound236) worth of toys, video games and board games on the account, and it wasn\u0027t until the next day her family discovered what she had done. An Amazon delivery driver turned up at their home the next day and started unloading box after box from his van.

Lucas Gary Narkle dragged his girlfriend toward the oncoming train as she struggled to avoid being hurled onto the tracks at Elizabeth South station in Adelaide in October last year. The shocking incident was caught on camera at the station. Narkle, 19, faced the South Australian District Court on Wednesday, after earlier pleading guilty to endangering the girl\u0027s life. She was just 14 years old at the time.  The court heard Narkle\u0027s girlfriend was holding on for dear life as she was being dragged by him. She wasn\u0027t to know that he was going to stop, a prosecutor said regarding the incident. Narkle was originally charged with attempted murder and at the time was armed with a baseball bat, although both sides agreed it was not used. The 19-year-old was taken into custody following the incident and spent more than three months in prison until he was granted bail by the Supreme Court in February. Judge Simon Stretton said on Wednesday he was unlikely to impose further jail time on Narkle.  I have to bear in mind that his actual actions here are brief, irresponsible and didn\u0027t cause any physical harm at all, he said. I think nothing is going to be served by imposing a further term of actual imprisonment but I am strongly inclined towards an extended community service work. Narkle arrived more than 30 minutes late for the hearing, blaming public transport issues for the delay, reports Australian media. “Shout out to my boys in Yatala (Labour Prison),” was his only comment to reporters outside court. Narkle will return to court for sentencing on Thursday.

It has been non-stop.“It was only five days and my first game so I need to know how my team-mates play.“I had four training sessions so it was a little bit crazy but it was good to help the team to win by scoring.“I’m happy with the start but the three points were the most important thing.“We have to start to win games but when I score it is always nice.“It was a good pass from Frederic Frans and I saw the goalkeeper went down so I just wanted to put it behind him and I think it was a good strike.“I think the first half was a good performance and we need to build on that.“The second half wasn’t perfect so we need to change something there.”Safranko joined the club on a year-long loan deal from Danish side Aalborg last week.He was well-known to manager Csaba Laszlo, though, as they worked together at Dunajska Streda (DAC) in Slovakia.There, Safranko knocked in six goals in 12 games after signing for the second half of the season as DAC went on an extended unbeaten run.And the chance to work with Csaba once more was a big draw for the striker once he heard Aalborg were happy to let him leave.He said: “I played under Csaba Laszlo in Slovakia at Dunajska Streda.“There we were unbeaten for 16 games in a row so I know what I can expect from him and I’m looking forward to playing for him again.“Csaba was the big part of why I joined Dundee United because I had a really good relationship with Csaba. I want to work for him.“I can honestly say that in Denmark there is a bit more combination football but here it is a little bit more fighting which will, hopefully, suit me better.“I can say every player dreams to play football in the United Kingdom so this was also one of the reasons I came here.”Safranko certainly knows the Scottish Championship is about “fighting” as he was given a welcome by the Queens backline.The makings of a black eye was clear in the Slovak’s face during and after the game as he battled with the Palmerston defenders.“I heard the Scottish league is quite hard – now I can feel it!” he added.“It is my style and how I play. We will see, I don’t want to speak too much because it was just my first game.”The Tangerines now have the best part of two weeks before their next Championship fixture – time Safranko thinks they can use to their advantage.“We will have time to train and I’m sure with this squad we can be much better in our next game.“The first half was our good phase because I had Nicky Clark close to me. He is a good player, and we can build on it.“Everyone fought and we have to continue with that because if just one person loses a battle, we will have problems.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b73f00fd264c.jpg ","title":"opening date revealed for dundee cctv control centre","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe date has been set for the new control centre to help tackle crime and antisocial behaviour to go live.The £750,000 Safety and Alarm Response Centre (SARC) will be a round-the-clock service to keep city residents safe.The base will allow Dundee City Council staff to respond to incidents more quickly by bringing footage from CCTV cameras – of which there are about 1,000 in the city – under one roof.It will also respond to the council’s 6,000 residents who are supported by the community alarm service.The centre, which will be housed at the West District Housing Office in Sinclair Street in Lochee, will also allow information to be passed between other agencies, including police, ambulance and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.The aim is to get to incidents more quickly, and in particular, alarm systems at sheltered housing complexes will be linked up to the SARC, allowing council officials and blue light services to respond faster.A tender of £86,056 for equipment including operator consoles and screens is set to be rubber-stamped by councillors at Monday’s policy and resources committee meeting.The building work is scheduled to be completed this month and the new consoles and screens to be fitted by October 19.The SARC is then scheduled to be fully operational on December 1.Key city sites such as the McManus Galleries, Dundee House and the V\u0026ampA – which opens next month – will be heavily monitored by existing CCTV cameras to avoid having them maliciously damaged.Graeme Mackenzie, service manager of community safety and resilience for the council said the “preservation of assets” such as these buildings was a priority for the local authority, as petty, malicious damage would have a “huge impact on resources”.The council received European Regional Development Fund funding for the SARC project which will part fund an upgrade to the city’s public space CCTV system.Council leader John Alexander said: “This will mean we have the technology and capability to do far more than we did before.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"plans for park for folk to exercise and relax at site of former dundee school stepped up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tProposals to create a “community park” in the grounds of the former Douglas Primary School are set to take a step forward.City councillors are to be asked next week to agree to the council joining forces with a local group to help make the park plan a reality.In a report to the neighbourhood services committee, Elaine Zwirlein, director of neighbourhood services, has recommended that an application by Douglas Community Spaces Group should be approved.Her report states: “It is recommended that approval is given for Dundee City Council to enter into a partnership agreement with Douglas Community Spaces Group (DCSG).“DCSG was established to develop and deliver a community park to provide a new landscaped space for the whole community to come together, grow, play, exercise and relax.“The community’s long-term hope is that the success of the park will instigate a process of improvement of further green spaces throughout Douglas by raising the aspiration, knowledge, skills, support and resources of local people.“Neighbourhood services’ landscape design team has been working with DCSG to develop proposals and has, on its behalf, submitted a stage one application for the development of the former Douglas Primary School ground to create Douglas Community Park.”The report said the site was an appropriate place for the park, having been used for community gala days for many years and being centrally located next to Douglas Community Centre.Further development work, supported by the Big Lottery and the council, would result in the next stage application being submitted on behalf of DCSG, it added.Margaret Hogg, chairwoman of Douglas Community Centre local management group, said the latest development was a welcome step for residents.She added: “This is definitely good news.

responsibility for the old Dalkeith Road tennis club, and now wants to hear ideas from residents about what can be done with the site.Committee members delivered flyers to nearby homes and urged all those with an interest in the club, including former members, to get involved with deciding its future.Craigie Community Sports Hub secretary and trustee George Allan, 72, said the group is hoping to develop the site “for some form of sporting activity”.He said: “The old Craigmuir tennis club had difficulties with membership numbers so we are trying to develop something practical for the community.“We don’t know about the future. It is close to properties on Dalkeith Road so we might have problems with what we can do with it. Some residents have brought up the idea of a five-a-side football park but residents might not want that.”The Dalkeith Road club has been out of action for more than two years. The courts once played host to about 50 members but are now overgrown with weeds.Residents who look onto the courts have voiced their disappointment at the club’s gradual decline in recent years.George said the sports committee will meet to consider the future of the site once the group had carried out public consultations.“It is important to tidy it up because it’s a bit of an eyesore and is in an unfit state at the moment,” he said.But he raised his doubts about whether the site could still be used as a tennis club.One of the reasons was because of competition from nearby courts at Baxter Park.He said: “We believe the opportunity for funding for tennis is limited. Tennis development is best provided through the schools.”The tennis courts opened in the 1920s, and were formerly know as Craigielea, before merging with the Stobsmuir club in the late 1990s to become Craigmuir Tennis Club.The club is understood to have tried a number of open days and advertising to attract more people but failed to draw in new members.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.702448.jpg ","title":"substance use recovery session to be held in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA substance use, stigma and supporting recovery awareness session is to take place in Dundee.The event is a part of the Recovery Friendly Dundee initiative which aims to tackle stigma surrounding misuse as well as raise awareness of the links between health inequalities and substance misuse.The session will run at Menzieshill Community Centre on Monday September 17 and is aimed at service providers.Tailored sessions to local community groups and volunteers are also available.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tech savvy feis an tairbeirt gives musicians a professional edge","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 08/08/18, 7:29 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Fèis an Tairbeirt workshop in music production, funded by Argyll and Bute Council\u0026#8217s Supporting Communities Fund, has been voted a success.Students recorded and produced their own tracks, created soundscapes with pre-recorded sounds, composed soundtracks and provided voiceovers for pieces of film and media during the three-day event.The chance to develop these skills is not usually offered outside of higher education but thanks to the knowledge and experience of tutor Luke Schofield, Fèis an Tairbeirt was able to offer this unique opportunity to local young adults.Another course has been arranged for September 15 and 16 and is limited to six places.The course is free but anyone interested should email feisantairbeirt@gmail to book a place.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

We look forward to VisitScotland accepting our proposals and working with us to ensure a smooth transfer of the facility over the coming weeks.\u0026#8216A lot of work will need to be carried out before the transfer and anyone wishing to volunteer should get in touch through our website.\u0026#8217A VisitScotland spokesman said: \u0026#8216We are currently in discussions with Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust about proposals for future use of the property and have the support of the local community.\u0026#8217Tarbert businessman Ian Macintyre believes the transfer of the premises should be a formality. He told the Advertiser: \u0026#8216In the original constitution for the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist board, the last paragraph is that in the event of this situation, any assets should transferred to an appropriate local body. I think that should still hold.\u0026#8217The trust\u0026#8217s asset transfer plan is backed by Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, who said: \u0026#8216I made it clear when this plan was first announced that there would have to be alternatives in place before any closure. That remains my position and I am concerned that, for example, there is still no fast mobile phone speeds and broadband in some parts of the area which are necessary to get information from the developing providers.\u0026#8216I have been supporting the proposal from the community trust for the Tarbert premises and I am hopeful that there can be an asset transfer, not least because it seems that the building was only given to VisitScotland on the understanding that if it stopped using it, it would revert to another body doing the same sort of work.\u0026#8217Councillor Alastair Redman added: \u0026#8216I would support the Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust in their talks to ask for an asset handover and take over the tourist centre building.\u0026#8217VisitScotland states that tourist information provision will continue across Argyll and Bute through a network of more than 130 VisitScotland Information Partners (VIPs) primarily based in hotels and guest houses, with three of these in Tarbert, four in Campbeltown and two in Inveraray, alongside \u0026#8216outreach\u0026#8217 staff attending events around the country.\u0026#8216It’s going to be a big miss in the village. I don’t know what they’re trying to do to small places.\u0026#8217 Flora Shaw, Earra Gael gift shop.\u0026#8216It’s terrible, because we get people coming in here asking us for information.

It\u0026#8217s mad even if it was just simply for the limited hours in October but we definitely need something in the summer months.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m not happy about it. They are a mine of information and when it closes I don’t know what we\u0026#8217ll do because our internet signal is so sketchy around here.\u0026#8217 Christine Entwistle, Harbour Gallery.\u0026#8216I think it’s a great pity.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united reject 150000 bid","story":"NewsAyr United reject £150,000 bid for striker Lawrence ShanklandUnited directors are holding firm in their bid to keep hold of the highly rated striker.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:09, 7 AUG 2018NewsShankland is a man in demand (Image: SNS Group)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have today rejected an offer of \u0026pound150,000 for star striker Lawrence Shankland.

The big bird was scoffing the chips close to the Gaiety Theatre in Ayr. A grainy image of the pointless attack has only now emerged. The man is wearing what looks like a white short sleeved shirt, black trousers and white training shoes. He is seen lifting his right leg back and then battering the chip-loving gull. Any kick to a creature like this would have left it in a very painful condition or at worst cause it to die from internal injuries. The chips had already been dropped on the ground close to the junction of Carrick Street and Boswell Park and it is not been regarded as a case where the gull actually stole the grub. Ironically the bird’s attacker was also eating his own portion of takeway food. The grainy image looks to have been taken from mobile phone footage. It appears to be right outside a late night food takeaway. The bird-brained incident took place on Saturday July 28 and only yesterday (Tuesday) was it able to be made public. An undercover inspector from the charity’s special investigations unit has been working on the case. He said: “We are being assisted by Police Scotland in our investigation and we would like to trace the individual involved. “I would urge anyone who recognises him to get in touch. “ Any information given to our animal helpline is treated confidentially and can be given nonymously. “Recently we have been made aware of a number of incidents involving attacks on seagulls and would like to remind the public that gulls, like all other birds, are protected by law. “We’d encourage the public to clear up any rubbish as gulls are attracted to it as they look for food.” Anyone who thinks they know the lout or remember him from that Saturday should call the Scottish SPCA animal helpline on 03000 999 999. Ayr is in the middle of a seagull crisis at the moment with some of them attacking people including a prominent lawyer who had to fight off the attack using a rolled up copy of the Ayrshire Post. He was pecked on the top of his head in Burns Statue Square and the attack drew blood.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsPolice Scotland"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13080662.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_090818LABOUR_07JPG.jpg","title":"scottish labour leader richard leonard","story":"NewsScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard stops off in Doon ValleyHe made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet13:53, 14 AUG 2018NewsLabour leader Richard Leonard visited Dalmellington (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRichard Leonard went on a charm offensive in an area that was once a Labour heartland. And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do?

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.

However, influencers must make it clear in such posts that they have been paid or rewarded to promote, review or talk about a product in their social media feeds under consumer protection law.  The CMA said fans or followers could be led to believe that an endorsement represents the star\u0026rsquos own view, rather than it being a paid-for promotion, if they do not label their posts properly.  It said it was investigating the extent to which influencers are clearly and accurately identifying any commercial relationships, and whether people are being misled.  George Lusty, the CMA\u0026rsquos senior director for consumer protection, said: \u0026ldquoSocial media stars can have a big influence on what their followers do and buy.  \u0026ldquoIf people see clothes, cosmetics, a car, or holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it.  \u0026ldquoSo, it\u0026rsquos really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8245524.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"stormzy-starts-scholarship-for-two-black-students-to-go-to-cambridge-university","story":"  Stormzy, 25, was speaking at his former school the Harris City Academy in Croydon, south London, where\u0026nbspA-level students are opening their results.

Mr Ross, who suffers from eye condition Stargardt disease, was working in the company\u0026rsquos Aberdeenshire brewery when he told bosses his eyesight had deteriorated and he was awaiting tests.  Despite reports from the RNIB and a specialist in visual impairment saying the 47-year-old could continue to work if some adjustments were made, Brewdog took the decision to dismiss him.  Mr Ross, from Fraserburgh, has now won his case for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination at an employment tribunal.  Speaking to the Herald, he said: \u0026ldquoThe way they dealt with my condition was really poor for a company of their size. The management just didn\u0026rsquot seem to have a clue how to deal with it, they just wanted to end it.  \u0026ldquoThey weren\u0026rsquot interested in making any changes, they just wanted me out.  \u0026ldquoBrewdog try to claim they\u0026rsquore this top company to work for, but I took this tribunal to show what they really are.  The tribunal heard that Mr Ross told the firm about his sight problems when he first started working for them in July 2016.  However, in January 2017 he told his manager that his vision was deteriorating.  He later provided Brewdog with a copy of a medical report stating that further tests were needed which would likely result in him being declared blind.  The company\u0026rsquos Health and Safety manager, John Fairclough, was asked to complete a risk assessment on Mr Ross and he was given a high risk rating.  An occupational health report was also ordered, which found that Mr Ross was not fit for work, but the tribunal found that this was not carried out by a medic with any expertise in visual impairment.  RNIB employment adviser Ruth Morrell then visited the brewery and recommended a number of changes that could allow him to keep working.  Mobility Officer Jeff Bligdon also visited the site and found that Mr Ross was still able to carry out his work without any difficulty.  In his report, Mr Bligdon stated: \u0026ldquoI felt that if [Brewdog] could end James\u0026rsquo employment with them, they would have done it there and then.  \u0026ldquoThe health and safety person was particularly negative towards James and came across as not wanting to adapt or try anything that would assist James.  Mr Ross was later sacked at a meeting in May after he rejected a computing role because it was harder for him to do with his eyesight problems.  The tribunal heard that managers involved in his case had no knowledge of the need to make adjustments for disabled people under the Equality Act.  Employment Judge Nick Hosie described this as \u0026ldquoastonishing.  The judge said that only \u0026ldquolip-service was paid to the law, while bosses also made \u0026ldquoblanket assumptions.  Judge Hosie added that Brewdog \u0026ldquoshould feel more than discomfort at the lack of awareness evidenced of their legal obligations to consider reasonable adjustments for an employee they recognised as disabled.

Mr Mustafa as targeted by Muslims in Glasgow and had to seek police protection after he spoke out about the more restrictive practices of Islam being propagated by Mosques.  In response, he says that 15 imams issued the fatwa\u0026nbsp - or ruling - calling for other Muslims to take action against him.  He has since been threatened with beheading by extremists after he claimed fasting between dawn and sunset during the month of Ramadan is not a requirement in the Quran, and has sought the protection of the police.    Paigham Mustafa  The father of three, said that many Muslims were being taught \"cultural\" lessons which strayed from the true meaning of Islam.  He believes the community has allowed itself to become isolated and backwards-looking, and has called on his fellow Muslims to be more open to Western values.  Mr Mustafa who spent several years writing his book \u0027The Quran: God\u0026rsquos Message to Mankind\u0027, said: \u0026ldquoIt is high time that British Muslims become pro-active instead of reactive. The murders and mayhem perpetrated by misguided Muslim militants in the UK, and the continuing radicalisation of disaffected Muslim youth makes this a topmost priority.  \u0026ldquoLogic, rationalism and pluralism must become the true hallmarks of British Islam to replace blind ritualism, outdated tribalism and a religious zealotry that are all predicated upon a largely anachronistic foreign-infused belief system.  The new organisation, named the Oxford Institute for British Islam (OIBI) says that it will \"not be beholden\" to medieval theological interpretations, misogynistic patriarchal biases, archaic political baggage, outmoded cultural norms, irrelevant tribal customs or bygone practices from \"distant ancestral homelands\".    The wearing of the Burka has come in for criticism recently  Mr Mustafa is its co-founder, alongside Dr Taj Hargey, the imam at Oxford Islamic Congregation and Director of the Muslim Education Centre of Oxford, who last week supported Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos views on the burka.  Work is being undertaken to secure funding from UK donors, and OIBI will officially launch in early 2019 from premises in Oxford.  It is intended to be an educational unit and research foundation which will address the secular needs and spiritual concerns of British Muslims, combining the worlds of religion, politics, society and philosophy.  OIBI\u0026rsquos goal is to become the chief catalyst for developing fresh intellectual rigour as well as championing positive socio-political and religious momentum within the British Muslim community.  The plan is to establish an independent publishing arm to distribute research output, and launch a new Journal of British Islam, which will print original articles and provocative submissions from across the religious, philosophical and political divide.    Mr Mustafa has criticised \"cultural\" practices for influencing Islam  \u0026ldquoMuslim social self-exclusion has become a largely voluntary phenomenon within the UK. This tendency towards Muslim segregation must be reversed to reduce social tensions, youth disaffection, juvenile criminality, economic deprivation, political disillusion and community alienation, said Mr Mustafa."},{"url":null,"title":"commuters-face-price-hikes-as-scotrail-fares-set-to-rise","story":"  ScotRail\u0027s regulated peak fares will go up by 3.2 per cent in January, with off peak ticket prices set to rise by 2.2%.

Of course there has been criticism from some corners that the Education Bill should have been introduced to Parliament. Equally there has been a lot said about whether legislation was ever necessary to achieve the change we want to see within the education system.  There will always be differing views on how best to improve attainment and ensure all of Scotland\u0026rsquos young people are given an equal opportunity to excel. The one thing we are all in agreement over is that we must do everything within our power to ensure our education system is the best it possibly can be.  So let me make the position absolutely clear.  This government\u0026rsquos number one priority remains education. My focus for the new term will be improving attainment and ensuring excellence and equity for all, as it has been since I took up post.  You may not agree with how I choose to achieve this, but you cannot accuse me of trying to do any less.  Legislation to help implement reform would be extremely useful and is a valid route to pursue. It would set out clear, and consistent standards for every local authority in Scotland and make it a legal requirement for these to be met.  I am not entirely dismissing this option. If sufficient progress is not made throughout the next year I will return to Parliament with the Education Bill and introduce it.  But this isn\u0026rsquot about party politicking and political point scoring. This is about doing what is right for Scotland\u0026rsquos schools.  I have been listening to many voices throughout this debate and the clear message I have received is that those working on the frontline believe they can achieve the same results faster, with fewer distractions. Anyone with a genuine interest in delivering the best possible outcomes for our young people should surely welcome this approach.  Recently there have been questions raised about the next steps for education reform. Let me give the reassurance that work to progress reform has never stopped.  We have been working closely with local government throughout the summer to take forward the changes that will improve our education system.  More control for schools, teachers and parents is on the way. Our Regional Improvement Collaboratives \u0026ndash groups created to share expertise and best practice at a local level \u0026ndash are already established with further detailed plans due to be published soon.  An independent panel on career pathways for teachers has already been set up. I want our teachers to know there will be exciting and challenging opportunities to enrich their career. Good news for teachers and good news for our learners who will benefit from enhanced expertise and experience.  A comprehensive action plan for parental involvement will be published next week and the new Scottish Learner Panel, enabling young people to help shape national education policy, will begin its work in the Autumn.  Reform is already gathering pace.  Whether we go down a legislative route or not our focus for the new term remains resolute.  This has been billed as the best chance in a generation to make radical improvements to our schools. I am committed to this challenge and I believe our education system is too."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-once-again-the-uk-is-being-sucked-into-the-quagmire-of-afghanistan","story":"  It was near there back in the mid 1980\u0026rsquos at the height of the Soviet war in the country, that I narrowly escaped capture by Russian troops before finally slipping back across the border into the safety of neighbouring Pakistan.  Wracked with dysentery and in the company of a wounded Australian photographer colleague whose radial nerve had been severed by shrapnel, we had lain on the floor of a battered bus crammed with dead and wounded Afghan guerrilla fighters for five days as it crawled across desert plains and hills towards the Pakistan frontier.  It was only near Ghazni that to our great relief, we at last managed to give our Russian pursuers the slip before making it out of Afghanistan.  Ghazni\u0026rsquos strategic position has always been important in Afghanistan\u0026rsquos seemingly interminable wars. Its proximity to Kabul and location on the major highway connecting the capital to the south makes it a vital lifeline.  It\u0026rsquos for precisely this reason that over the past week, this city of some 280,000 people has found itself at the centre of a fierce battle as Taliban insurgents sought to capture it.  It was last Friday when more than 1,000 Taliban fighters stormed the city in a predawn assault. Reports indicate that a number of foreign fighters aided the Taliban in their offensive, among them Pakistani and Chechen jihadists and even some al-Qaeda affiliates.  For a while it was touch and go with the Taliban gaining control of much of Ghazni before Afghan Army troops backed by US forces retook the embattled city on Tuesday. This though is far from being an isolated incident.  No sooner had the security forces reasserted their control over Ghazni, than the Taliban in the past few days have again attacked and seized large parts of an army base in the northern province of Faryab, killing at least 10 soldiers and capturing dozens of others.  The latest violence not only raises questions over much mooted peace talks with the Taliban but also casts a shadow over Afghanistan\u0026rsquos upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for October 20.  It\u0026rsquos against this volatile backdrop too that Britain this week deployed another four hundred and forty troops, effectively almost doubling its \u0026lsquoboots on the ground\u0026rsquo to a total of 1,090 military personnel.  It\u0026rsquos now four years since British troops \u0026lsquodeparted\u0026rsquo from Afghanistan. During those 13 years of fighting hundreds of British lives were lost while some \u0026pound40bn was spent trying to tame the Taliban.  During my time embedded as a correspondent within both British and American units, I watched as the consummate professionalism of those troops on the ground was slowly eroded by the stark realisation that this was a war that was unwinnable.  The new plan now the politicians duly told us was that Nato would formally end its retaliation for Afghanistan harbouring Osama bin Laden. It would withdraw its forces and leave the Afghan government and its military along with continued \u0026lsquoadvisory\u0026rsquo support to deal with the Taliban itself. Cue the UK\u0026rsquos latest troop deployment which we are told, will involve little more than ferrying international advisors safely around the country\u0027s capital city, Kabul, in their Foxhound vehicles hence giving rise to them being dubbed \u0026ldquoArmoured Uber.  But all these \u0026lsquojolly japes\u0026rsquo aside, the reality remains that the Taliban is in the ascendancy, and any support role undertaken by UK troops still puts them in harms way. That we have all been here before and seemingly learned nothing beggars belief. As does the fact that the UK government\u0026rsquos agreement to deploy more troops is almost certainly done to assuage US President Donald Trump after his Nato visit last month.  Mr Trump, a president who promised to bring US troops home from foreign campaigns is now faced with the harsh reality of a re-galvanised Taliban, and is making sure his UK and Nato allies are not let of the hook when it comes to sharing the burden in the fight against them.  Not that all of this really matters in the military scheme of things, given that the Taliban is now said to be in control of 70 per cent of the country.  Yes, that\u0026rsquos the stark reality of where Afghanistan stands right now. Seventeen years on since a US and UK deployment that has cost tens of thousands of Afghan lives, thousands of American and British lives combined and swallowed up billions of dollars, we are right back where we started.  Only last month the New York Times highlighted how the newest US military strategy in Afghanistan \u0026ldquomirrors past plans for retreat. In other words it calls for American-backed Afghan troops to pull back from partially populated areas of the country.  This of course will ensure that the Taliban and other Islamist groups will effectively hold on to territory that they have already seized, leaving the government in Kabul to safeguard the capital and major cities such as Kandahar, Kunduz, Mazar-i-Sharif and Jalalabad. At least that\u0026rsquos how the thinking went until the Taliban this past week threw a spanner in the works with its assault on Ghazni.  What is this \u0026lsquoretreat to the city\u0026rsquo if not searing confirmation that the American installed government in Afghanistan remains unable to lead and protect the country\u0026rsquos sprawling rural population? Barely over one-quarter of Afghanistan\u0026rsquos population lives in urban areas.  If there\u0026rsquos a sense of deja vu about all of this, then it\u0026rsquos because those thirty or so years ago when I travelled with the Afghan guerrillas back in the 80\u0026rsquos, the Soviets then too in their own war had abandoned rural areas allowing opposition fighters to control most of the country.  We should have learned from the Russians own decade long experience then, but we didn\u0026rsquot. We should have learned too from our own more recent military campaign in the country, but it appears that we haven\u0026rsquot.  Unpalatable as it might be, the inescapable fact is that any chance of a political solution in Afghanistan right now is just as remote as a military one. Once again slowly but surely we are being drawn back into the Afghanistan quagmire, and it\u0026rsquos only a matter of time before it costs us dearly."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-may-my-quest-to-raise-profile-of-scottish-innovator-in-3d-photography","story":"  But while Queen\u0027s electric brand of arena-thrilling hits has stirred the souls of millions, the passions of the former PhD Astronomy student have turned out to be a little more niche.  Famously, he has been an unlikely champion of badgers and previously railed against the attempted cull of hedgehogs on Uist.  But (Dr) Brian May\u0027s current obsession germinates from a childhood devotion to collectable 3D cards handed out free in the 1950s inside boxes of Weetabix.

George Washington Wilson, based in Aberdeen, was appointed Photographer to the Queen in 1873 and is considered one of the greatest \u0027lensmen\u0027 of his generation.  Records of about his skill producing 3D images have now largely faded from history, but Wilson (1823 to 1893) is a personal hero to Brian May, who now owns one of the largest collections in the world of Victorian stereo photographs.  Brian May spoke to The Herald as he appeared at the Edinburgh International Book Festival discussing a \u0027labour of love\u0027 book about George Washington Wilson, by Prof Roger Taylor (who coincidentally shares the same name as the Queen drummer), for which May provided the introduction.  \"This is one of the reasons we got into this, is to try and put [George Washington Wilson] back in his place, where he should be,\" he said.  And May told an audience in the Main Theatre of the festival, at a sold out event,\u0026nbspthat his zeal for stereoscopic pictures sparked a curiosity to have a go himself, taking unique images of his family and bandmates.  One particularly intimate picture of Freddie Mercury, he finds particularly moving.  He said: \u0026ldquoMy favourite is one I had no knowledge of, which I did not remember, was one of Freddie backstage putting on make up.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very intimate and very personal, it\u0026rsquos one the paparazzi would never get because he\u0026rsquod be so conscious of them.  \"But I was always there.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos something so precious to me, it\u0026rsquos not only candid and personal, but it is 3D as well, so it feels like you could walk into it and touch Freddie.  \u0026ldquoTo be honest, my team nursed me through it, because some of it was quite difficult for me, it can be a little bit too personal.  The latest George Washington Wilson book, published by May\u0027s London Stereoscopic Company (LSC) firm, follows a previous major work by Prof Taylor from1981 which fell out of print.  Speaking yesterday, Professor Taylor said: \"One of the reasons Wilson fell out of favour was because he was so prolific, he was everywhere and people couldn\u0027t make any sense of it.  \"But his real contribution to me is his 3D work, his stereoscopic work.\"  He added: \"I really hope this book will help put him back up there, because he really was important.  \"He was dismissed because he was commercial, but that reach and popularity and entrepreneurialism is something we celebrate.\"  George Washington Wilson, by Prof Roger Taylor, was published on 15 August"},{"url":null,"title":"yes-demo-at-snp-conference-to-urge-action-on-second-independence-referendum","story":"  In a further sign of division in the independence movement, scores of people are planning to demonstrate at the SNP conference in October to push for another vote.

However the First Minister \u0026ldquoreset her plans after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election, and is due to update Holyrood on her new timetable in October.  Senior SNP figures such as MP Pete Wishart and MSP Alex Neil have urged caution, downplaying the prospect of another plebiscite in the near future.

Overall, 48 per cent of Scots want a public vote, 31 per cent are opposed and 22 per cent don\u0026rsquot know, compared to 45, 34 and 22 per cent respectively for the UK as a whole.  The YouGov poll of 2000 Scottish adults also showed Scotland is now keener about staying in the European Union than ever, with 66 per cent of decided voters backing Remain and 34 backing Leave, compared to the 62-38 split two years ago.  SNP voters are the strongest Remain supporters, backing it 83-17, suggesting a recent swing against Brexit among many Nationalists, a third of whom voted Leave.  In the UK as a whole, sentiment has also shifted in favour of Remain, but only just.  Just 12 per cent of Scots expect the UK to get a \u0026ldquogood deal from the Brexit negotiations, in which Theresa May is pushing her soft Brexit Chequers plan, and 68 per cent a poor one.  The poll was commissioned by the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign which is holding a rally in Edinburgh this Saturday in support of a public vote on the final outcome of the Brexit talks.  The survey found a remarkable 86 per cent of Scots (95 per cent of SNP voters), regarded the process of leaving the EU so far as \u0026ldquoa mess.  It also found 65 per cent of Scots felt the UK government was ignoring Scotland\u0026rsquos concerns on Brexit, 70 per cent did not trust Westminster on Brexit, and 80 per cent, including most Leavers thought the promises of Brexiter politicians would be broken.  Most SNP, LibDem and Labour voters said Brexit would weaken the economy, cost jobs, lower living standards, hurt the NHS, raise taxes and make today\u0026rsquos children worse off.  Most Scottish Tory voters said Brexit would improve the same things or have no impact.  Asked if Brexit would make Scottish independence more likely, 43 per cent said yes, 6 per cent said less likely, and 35 per cent said it would make no difference.  The People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign said the findings would \u0026ldquopile pressure on the SNP and Labour leaderships to support a vote on the Brexit outcome.  Former YouGov president Peter Kellner said: \u0026ldquoSupport for a public vote on the outcome is growing across the UK but is particularly strong in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThere is deep pessimism about what Brexit will mean for Scotland and the next generation.  \u0026ldquoThe survey suggests the leaderships of both the SNP and the Labour Party are in the wrong place with most of their supporters.  \u0026ldquoThere may be an electoral dividend in Scotland for one of these parties if they strengthen their position. For instance, by a margin of three to one Labour supporters want Jeremy Corbyn to campaign for a public vote while Nicola Sturgeon may yet want to move faster than she has in backing such a route on Brexit.  The First Minister has said the SNP will not be a block to a vote on the Brexit deal, and said such a vote may be \u0026ldquoirresistible, but has never endorsed it.  Many Nationalists fear that if the SNP backed a second EU vote it would set a precedent that would be used against them in the event of a Yes to independence.  Former SNP minister Alex Neil, who backed Brexit, said: \u0026ldquoIf we supported a second Brexit referendum, when we win Indyref2, the Unionists would demand an Indyref3 to overturn it.  A separate poll for the Left Foot Forward website yesterday found most voters in the UK would blame Theresa May for a no-deal Brexit rather than the EU.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie warned Ms Sturgeon and Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard were \u0026ldquoout of step with the country.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe benefits of remaining in the EU are irreplaceable and the people can see quite clearly that whatever deal the Conservatives patch together will not be as good as the one we have now. But even as the Conservatives bumble towards a cliff edge, Scottish Labour and the SNP are still refusing to swing into action.  \"Every day that passes Nicola Sturgeon and Richard Leonard are looking more out of step with the people of Scotland. They need to end the ifs and buts and listen to the huge majority of Scots calling for a final say.\"  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoIt is a democratic outrage that Scotland is being forced out of the EU against our will. People in Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and the SNP continues to believe this is the best option for Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  We will not be a block on a second EU referendum but the views of the people of Scotland must not be ignored all over again if there is to be another vote.  \"The Tories now think they can do anything they want to Scotland and get away with it. Their extreme Brexit is threatening jobs, livelihoods and the interests of ordinary people, as well as the powers of the Scottish Parliament.  Former Labour PM Gordon Brown yesterday told the Edinburgh Book Festival more than 1m Labour Leave voters across the UK had turned against Brexit.  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoA second referendum is not Labour policy and wasn\u0026rsquot in our manifesto. Labour has always insisted that Parliament has a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal.\""},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mail-redirection-service-designed-for-households-of-the-past-claims-citizens-advice","story":"  Citizens Advice said the service is \u0026ldquodesigned for households of the past by charging for each surname rather than by household.  Royal Mail said it agreed that a different pricing structure was needed and is currently \u0026ldquoworking on the details.  Currently, consumers pay an upfront fee based on the length of time they want to use the service, with three packages ranging from \u0026pound33.99 per surname for three months to \u0026pound66.99 for 12 months.  A couple with different surnames would therefore be charged double for the service, \u0026ldquopenalising unmarried couples and spouses who keep their own names, and children and elderly relatives with different surnames, the charity said.  Adding the cost of just one additional surname makes the service more expensive than any other country, its research found.  Citizens Advice, the statutory consumer advocate for postal services, found that more than half of people (55%) who have moved house within the last two years live with at least one person who has a different surname from them.  It found that, since 2012, the price of a three-month redirection has increased by 74%, while second-class stamps have only gone up 12%.  A quarter of those surveyed (26%) said the price was one of the reasons they did not use the service last time they moved.  Citizens Advice is also calling for Royal Mail to make the service more affordable by offering an option to pay in monthly instalments for those who cannot afford a one-off payment, and concessionary rates for consumers on the lowest incomes.  Some 84% of consumers think Royal Mail should ensure its redirection service is affordable for people who need to use it.  The same survey found those who did pay for mail redirection were highly satisfied with the service they received.  According to the Office for National Statistics, 32% of families have \u0026ldquonon-traditional structures outside the married heterosexual couple, such as cohabiting opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples and lone-parent families.  Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: \u0026ldquoMany people rely on Royal Mail\u0026rsquos redirection service, yet it\u0026rsquos designed for households of the past.  \u0026ldquoConsumers are facing a double whammy. Royal Mail has drastically increased the price of redirection over the years but hasn\u0026rsquot changed its outdated price structure that assumes families always share the same surname.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore calling on Royal Mail to change its mail redirection service to no longer charge per surname within the same household. As the dedicated universal service provider, it has a duty to make sure this service is fair and affordable.  A Royal Mail spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe agree with Citizens Advice that there is a need for a different pricing structure.  \u0026ldquoWe wrote to Citizens Advice last week, before the report was issued, to confirm that we will change the pricing structure of our popular redirections service away from a per surname basis or anything similar.  \u0026ldquoWe are currently working on the details of this new pricing structure and will share once finalised.  YouGov surveyed 4,107 British adults online between December 18 and January 17."},{"url":null,"title":"coral-bleaching-dates-back-400-years","story":"  Researchers from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh have dated the phenomenon back four centuries by examining cores extracted from old corals.  Large-scale coral bleaching has raised concern about the future of the ecosystems and the impact their loss could have on biodiversity.  The teams found the frequency of bleaching has increased since the 1800s and, despite corals\u0026rsquo ability to recover,\u0026nbspthere are fears they could now be approaching a \u0026ldquocritical threshold.  Dr Nick Kamenos from Glasgow\u0026rsquos School of Geographical and Earth Sciences said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clear in the core data we examined that bleaching has been occurring on the Great Barrier Reef for at least 400 years, but the frequency of bleaching events has increased markedly since the early 1800s and those events have affected 10% more corals since the late 1700s.  \u0026ldquoWe can see that corals have been able to acclimate and recover from past bleaching events.  \u0026ldquoHowever, the increase in bleaching frequency and the numbers of corals affected since temperatures started consistently increasing in the modern era raises serious concerns about whether corals are approaching a critical threshold beyond which their long-term survival is uncertain.  Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise too high and disrupt the relationship between the coral and the tiny algae living inside it.  When the algae are expelled, it leaves the coral a stark white. They\u0026nbspcan be reabsorbed when the water temperature drops again, but corals die if this separation is too long.  Dr Sebastian Hennige from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos School of Geosciences said: \u0026ldquoFor this study we used the most conservative methods we could in some of the toughest corals out there today.  \u0026ldquoThe fact that we are seeing an increase in bleaching even in these tough corals highlights just how serious the threat of coral bleaching is, and how important it is that we take action now to reduce this threat.  The paper, titled Reconstructing four centuries of temperature-induced coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, is published in the journal Frontiers.  The study was supported by funding from the Natural Environment Research Council, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Scottish Government."},{"url":null,"title":"holy-grail-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-up-to-900000","story":"  The 1926 Macallan Valerio Adami is due to be auctioned at Bonhams Whisky Sale in Edinburgh in October with an estimation of between \u0026pound700,000 and \u0026pound900,000.

The box contains items such as clothing, a toy, a play mat, books, a towel, a sling carrier and thermometers. Meanwhile, the box itself can be used as a sleeping space for new babies.  The projected cost of the initiative was \u0026pound8 million for 2017/18, rising to \u0026pound8.8 million for each of the following three years.  Maree Todd, the Children and Early Years Minister at Holyrood, said the gift shows that \u0026ldquothe country welcomes this baby too.  On the take-up of the box, she told Press Association Scotland: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos amazing. When I saw that over 50,000 babies had received a box \u0026ndash over 1,000 a week \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a really exciting point in the history of this baby box.  \u0026ldquoI think this is about the baby box becoming part of the national psyche in Scotland.  She told how the box contains several items that parents might not necessarily think of buying.  \u0026ldquoSome of the most positive feedback comes from the thermometers, she said.  \u0026ldquoThe ear thermometer, in particular, is quite an expensive piece of kit and people don\u0026rsquot think about buying it necessarily until the baby is sick.  \u0026ldquoSo it\u0026rsquos great that it comes in the baby box and they are able to use it and access medical help and support quickly if they need it.  Critics at the start of the scheme suggested that giving the box to any eligible parents, including those who can easily afford the contents, did not represent the best use of public funds.  However, Ms Todd insisted: \u0026ldquoI think that (the universality) is one of the nicest things about the box.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos one of the things that many parents give me very positive feedback about. They like it that every baby in the land is welcomed in the same way and there\u0026rsquos no stigma associated with it.  Ms Todd was speaking following an event at the Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh, where a baby box is to go on display.  A parent survey earlier revealed the most popular items were the room thermometer, followed by the ear thermometer and the sling.  The majority of mothers and fathers (62%) said they had used or planned to use the box as a bed.          Tomorrow is the 1st birthday of Scotland\u0027s baby box!

A: Clearing is the annual process that allows students without a university place, or who want to switch to a different one, to search for and find a degree course with availability.  You can use Clearing if you are applying for the first time after June 30, if you did not receive any offers from any universities, or none you wanted to accept, or if you did not meet the required grades needed for your chosen university course.  Q: When does Clearing open and how long does it last?  A: Clearing opened on July 5 and closes on October 23.  Q: How do I apply for a university place through Clearing?  A: If you haven\u0026rsquot already applied for a university place through the main application scheme, you need to submit an application to Ucas. You will then be sent an email and have access to Ucas\u0026rsquos online system, Track. You\u0026rsquoll also be given a Clearing number.  Search for courses you are interested in, and when you have found one you want to study, call the university or college and ask them if they will accept you. You\u0026rsquoll need to give them your Clearing number.  Once you have found one you are happy with, and they have said they will take you, you can add the course through Track.  Q: How do I add a Clearing choice?  A: Once you\u0026rsquove chosen your course and the university or college has said they\u0026rsquoll accept you, click \u0026ldquoadd clearing choice on the Track system and fill in the course details.  The university will then confirm your place.  Filling in and submitting the course details means you have definitely accepted the offer, so if the university confirms it, it will show as an acceptance on your \u0026ldquochoices page in Track.  You can only add one choice at a time. You\u0026rsquoll be able to add a different one if the university or college does not confirm your place.  Q: How long does Clearing take?  A: How long it takes depends on how long you want to take to make a choice, and how long it takes for the university or college you choose to confirm your place.  Q: How does Clearing work in Scotland?  A: Clearing works the same way for all students, regardless of where they live in the UK.  Q: When do universities get A-level results?  A: Universities receive prospective students\u0026rsquo grades in the days before A-level results day under strict embargo to allow them to confirm whether applicants have gained the required results. Students can sign in to Track on ucas from 8am on August 16, where they will be able to see if they\u0026rsquove been accepted.  Q: Is it easy to get into university through Clearing?  A: There are around 30,000 courses available in Clearing, and each one will have different grade and qualification requirements.  You should think carefully about what you want to do and where you want to study, as well as whether you meet the requirements to be accepted on to the course.  There is now no cap on the number of students a university or college can admit, so many institutions will still be looking for good candidates for their degree courses through Clearing.

Typically, celebrities and influencers have millions of followers who watch their channels to see where they go on holiday, what they wear, which products they use, the books they read and more.  Online endorsements from celebrities and influencers can help brands reach target audiences and boost sales.  However, influencers must make it clear in such posts that they have been paid or rewarded to promote, review or talk about a product in their social media feeds under consumer protection law.  The CMA said fans or followers could be led to believe that an endorsement represents the star\u0026rsquos own view, rather than it being a paid-for promotion, if they do not label their posts properly.  It said it was investigating the extent to which influencers are clearly and accurately identifying any commercial relationships, and whether people are being misled.  George Lusty, the CMA\u0026rsquos senior director for consumer protection, said: \u0026ldquoSocial media stars can have a big influence on what their followers do and buy.  \u0026ldquoIf people see clothes, cosmetics, a car, or holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it.  \u0026ldquoSo, it\u0026rsquos really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand."},{"url":null,"title":"information evening for potential teachers","story":"        Aberdeenshire Council is holding an information evening for anyone considering studying part-time to become a secondary school teacher.

For not only will it commemorate the centenary of the end of World War One, but it will also mark the centenary of the restoration of Poland’s sovereignty as the Second Polish Republic from the German, Austrian and Russian Empires.                                       \t      \t\tLabour of love...for Keith Burns, project manager from MAPA Scotland, the charity founded to restore the Great Polish Map of Scotland in 2010. Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county...

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

But it has lodged an application in the hope permission will be in place to begin as soon as the funding target is met.The plans feature a cinema seating roughly 30 people and hosting weekly screenings, rising to twice-weekly in the summer.It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing annual film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country.Cromarty Estate plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema to cater for growing business demand.A spokesman said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation. The result is that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"\u0026nbspThe society hopes to screen at least one movie a week drawn from the film programme at Eden Court in Inverness.It would initially be volunteer-run but there are plans to eventually train up managers and projectionists \"who would also be able to work at Eden Court\".Mr Mackenzie-Blackman said sharing films in this way would allow the film society to avoid having to pay licensing fees.He said, in addition, Eden Court may handle online bookings from its box office in Inverness.He added: \"If Cromarty and Resolis Film Society raise the money needed to make the project happen I will be firmly supportive of it.\"We will work in collaboration with them to help them project the cinema in Cromarty.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down.

He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Jo Bennett, clerk of the congregation’s nominating committee, said: “People talk about Iona as a thin place – a place where the distance between heaven and earth collapses.  “I think Tiree has that too, but it’s also very much a working community - you get both aspects here.“A minister here has the chance to see the impact of the work they do and be the focal point for the community.”READ MORE: Message in a bottle sent from Iceland washes up on Tiree after a yearMr Bennett said the congregation was regularly boosted in the summer months by visitors from around the world.             “In Summer we get visitors from around the world but in winter it may be much smaller,” he added.“It’s always a mixture of people who visit regularly and people visiting for the first time.”The manse is situated outside the village of Scarinish, just yards from the sea and with views to the Treshnish Isles, Mull and Iona across the passage of Tiree.Although the church building only dates to 1902, Tiree has a long Christian tradition going back to St Columba and his companion Beithene, who was the abbot on the island in the sixth century.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

The lack of a debate on Andrew Wilson\u0026#8217s Growth Commission at SNP conference is a startling omission, writes Tom Peterkin.                Councillor Christopher McEleny is fast emerging as one of the SNP’s more colourful characters. Twice he has stood to be SNP depute leader. Twice he has been defeated, firstly by Angus Robertson, and most recently by Keith Brown, the former Economy Secretary who is now Nicola Sturgeon’s right-hand man as far as the party is concerned.            Despite being on the receiving end of comprehensive defeats, the Inverclyde councillor refuses to slide back into the relative obscurity of local authority politics.            It was earlier this month that Mr McEleny found himself in the headlines when the judge in an employment tribunal ruled that his support for Scottish independence qualified as a “philosophical belief”. The conclusion was reached by judge Frances Eccles in a case that saw Mr McEleny pursue his former employer, the Ministry of Defence, claiming he had been unfairly targeted over his views.The background to the case was that around the time of his first unsuccessful attempt to become SNP depute leader in 2016, he was told that his security clearance had been revoked for his job as an electrician at the MoD munitions site in Beith, North Ayrshire.He said he was interviewed by national security officials on issues including his pro-independence views. After being suspended from his job, he left it, claiming he was unfairly targeted for his stance on leaving the UK and his support for the “social democratic values” of the SNP.READ MORE: SNP Growth Commission report: Five key points            In her judgment, Judge Eccles rather neatly summed up exactly how Mr McEleny felt about Scottish independence.“The claimant was clear in his evidence that he does not believe in Scottish independence because it will necessarily lead to improved economic and social conditions for people living in Scotland”, she said. “It is a fundamental belief in the right of Scotland to national sovereignty.”So there you have it. Mr McEleny’s belief in breaking up the UK runs through him like letters through a stick of rock. His desire for indep­endence is so strong that it trumps pro-indy arguments based on the notion that securing a Yes vote is the best way to improve Scotland economically and socially.Given that independence – come what may and damn the consequences – appears to be an existential part of the councillor’s being, it was perhaps somewhat surprising to see his most recent contribution to internal SNP politics.            Earlier this week Mr McEleny took to Twitter to reveal that the party’s latest independence blueprint will not be debated at its October conference. He said it was “absolutely astonishing” that the list of 32 motions for debate in Glasgow did not include any of Andrew Wilson’s much-vaunted Growth Commission or his proposal to stick with the pound for around a decade after independence. Even the man for whom independence is a “philosophical belief” is objecting to the party’s failure to take a long and hard look at the harsh economic reality at independence. A similar row erupted before the SNP’s most recent conference in June, which happened to take place shortly after Mr Wilson published his 354-page magnum opus.Despite the fact that the SNP document was the hot topic of the moment, there was no formal debate on its proposals, which are absolutely fundamental to the party’s next drive for independence. Instead, discussion of the document was relegated to a fringe meeting. That meeting offered some explanation as to why it might suit the SNP not to pore over the document in public. It was easily the stormiest session of the conference as the former SNP MP and economist George Kerevan criticised its contents. READ MORE: SNP Growth Commission strengthens case for union, claims pro-UK think tankThe future plotted by the commission would, said Mr Kerevan, leave Scotland “at the mercy” of the banks, because its plans to keep the pound without Bank of England protection for a decade would hinder the ability to grow the Scottish economy. This, he argued, would put the poor at risk.            The difficulty for the SNP is that Mr Kerevan’s views are shared by many who, like him, can be found on the left of the party. Mr Wilson won praise for constructing a more realistic case for independence than that made in Alex Salmond’s white paper published ahead of the 2014 referendum.But realism can have its drawbacks. Mr Wilson’s approach to cutting Scotland’s £13.3 billion deficit has seen the highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warn that Scotland would see a “continuation of austerity”.One can understand why the SNP leadership might be reluctant to air these points and internal divisions at their autumn shindig. Rather, the Growth Commission is to be discussed internally at a series of SNP National Assemblies. The outcome of these discussions are then scheduled to be brought before party conference in spring next year or the National Council this coming December. In the meantime, it feels strange to be heading to another SNP conference where the biggest elephant in the room will be Mr Wilson’s indy blueprint.Or as the Inverclyde councillor who is rapidly becoming the SNP’s best-known controversialist put it: “How can we not be debating the biggest contribution to the independence case since 2014?”That may not amount to a “philosophical belief” for Councillor McEleny, but it is still a pretty good point."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4784782.1534402548!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll nearly half of scots would support brexit deal referendum","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Around two-thirds of Scots think the UK is ignoring their concerns and don’t trust Westminster to take these decisions.“But the survey suggests the leaderships of both the SNP and the Labour Party are in the wrong place with most of their supporters.“There may be an electoral dividend in Scotland for one of these parties if they strengthen their position.“For instance, by a margin of three to one Labour supporters want Jeremy Corbyn to campaign for a public vote while Nicola Sturgeon may yet want to move faster than she has in backing such a route on Brexit.”The campaign group has organised a rally in Edinburgh on Saturday calling for a referendum on the Brexit deal."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick.

A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday.

Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK.

Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nThursday 16 Aug 2018 10:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It was a fantastic opportunity to meet with like-minded individuals and share information regarding our available resources and capabilities. We are looking to make this a regular occurrence which will benefit all agencies. Recruitment was also a priority for the agencies and we are keen to encourage new, keen local individuals to become part of our emergency services family. We look forward to hearing from interested members of the public who may become valuable members of the emergency services in the future.”\nAs far as the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is concerned, Mr. Colliar said anyone is welcome to drop in when training is taking place at Skye fire stations. Dunvegan, Portree, Staffin and Raasay train between 7 pm and 9 pm every Monday, as does Raasay, while Uig is on a Tuesday evening and Broadford on Wednesday. Those stations will also be open to the public on the weekend of 28th and 29th July between 10 am and 2 pm.

The tourism industry’s treatment of seasonal workers has also come under the spotlight in reports which island firms say has painted an unfair picture of local business.\nThe letter, which was co-ordinated by local MSP Kate Forbes and tourism promotional body SkyeConnect, said: “Nearly everybody on the islands is linked in some way to tourism, and the economic opportunities of the tourism industry support the rural and remote communities of Skye, Raasay and beyond.\n“The tourist industry can be a relatively unpredictable industry and so it concerns us to see sensationalist stories in the national press, for a second year running, which could jeopardise the jobs, businesses and income of local people.\n“We would hate to see an industry which has taken many years to develop undermined by a few stories which don’t fairly depict the efforts of hardworking people across the area.”\nThe letter also backs recent investment in infrastructure at some of Skye’s most popular sites.\nIt adds: “The Isle of Skye and Raasay, like many areas of the Highlands and Islands, is home to communities whose future is dependent on good jobs, steady incomes and business opportunities.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

And this has been going on at this address for over 60 years. It’s the boys at the minute but previous to that it was their daddy and before that their grandfather Ernie.

inspires local woman to take on berlin marathon","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman is taking on 26.2 miles at one of the world’s most famous marathons on September 16 to help raise money for the British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects.

I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay. I have a sizeable investment in this street and I feel as a business owner I should have a say,” she concluded.\n  \nA Mid and East Antrim Council spokesperson said: “Plans are being considered to extend the public realm scheme on this street, however, these are at a very early stage. \n  \n“We will be liaising with traders over the coming weeks in relation to initial consultation on concept designs.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921291.jpg--.jpg?1534232684000\n","title":"dungonnell dam features on ulster giants tv show","story":"  \nA reservoir in the hills between Ballymena and the glens features in the new series celebrating the achievements in Northern Ireland of the Institution of Civil Engineers on the occasion of their 200th anniversary. \n  \nThe fifth episode of ‘Ulster Giants’, which continues on Monday, August 20 at 8pm on UTV is all about water and the various ways in which it has been collected, stored and treated before being delivered to our homes and workplaces. \n  \nJoe Mahon’s first port of call is the now abandoned Hunt’s Park Water Tower in Donaghadee in Co. Down. \n  \nAnd of local interest, he also visits the water treatment works at Dungonnell Dam in the Antrim Hills. \n  \nJoe interviews Derek McKane of NI Water, who demonstrates the operation of the dam and takes him on a tour of the bewildering number of processes our modern water supply has to undergo before it is deemed fit for human consumption. \n  \n“After watching this you’ll never take tap water for granted again!” Joe promises.\n  \nCivil engineer Alan Cooper then directs our attention to the innovative construction of the actual dam itself – the first to be built using asphalt, and employing many of the same construction methods you would find in road-building! Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost.

This is the biggest thing I’ve ever had to look forward to and hopefully something that will genuinely change my life, for the better, forever. I’m particularly excited to become a DWU Tiger and play for the school soccer team - I think that’ll be cool and something so different to teams at home.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I decided to apply for Study USA because I’d heard that it was an amazing experience and I know without a doubt the programme will have a positive impact on my future -  It’ll make me look more attractive to employers showing I took the chance to go and grow as person both independently and communicatively.\n\n“Hopefully it will also broaden my own personal network which in itself is an intangible asset to any business employing me as they gain potential connections in America, should they be necessary.”\n\nThe British Council, which is the UK’s international organisation for educational opportunities and cultural relations, manages Study USA on behalf of the Department for the Economy. Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy.

In addition, the company has faced an extremely challenging retail trading environment reflecting weak consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. These factors have had a significant adverse impact on Homebase’s trading position.\n\n“After a comprehensive review, Homebase has concluded that its current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\n\n“The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\n\n“It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\n\n“The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure. The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\n\n“All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.”\n\nDamian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”\n\nStephanie Pollitt, Assistant Director of Real Estate Policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account. Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8478809.1533901811!/image/image.jpg","title":"was speeding in hurry to get to work","story":"\nIn a hurry to get to work a 49-year-old man broke the speed limit in his van, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nAsen Asenov, whose address was given as Flush Place, Lurgan, was fined £75 for excess speed on May 30 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThree penalty points were also imposed and he was ordered to pay a £15 offender’s levy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor having a defective light on his vehicle he was fined £50.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe court heard that at 11.30pm on the Portadown Road in Lurgan police saw a Mercedes Sprinter van with a Bulgarian registration travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit.\n\nThey followed the van for a distance of over half a mile and to keep up they were doing between 60mph and 65mph.\n\nPolice also noticed that the right rear side light was not working.\n\nThrough an interpreter Asenov said he had been rushing that day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained that he had already received a warning about his job and he didn’t want to be late.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts travel updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We, too, must step out of the darkness.\"\n\nPrayers and readings from scripture by members of the main Churches were included in the short service. \n\nIt concluded with an invite to the people who had attended to take with them white petals and scatter them at the pond of the nearby Memorial Gardens.\n\nFr Eugene Hasson thanked those who came to pay their respects. He said: \"Your presence is a mark of your solidarity with all who have suffered because of what happened on this day in 1998.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmagh bomb 20th anniversary remembrance ceremony. Picture by Jonathan Porter/PressEye\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of floral tributes had been placed at the foot of the glass memorial on Market Street, one with the simple message: \"Justice for All.\"\n\nKevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena was among those who died in the explosion, said it had been a harrowing few days.\n\nHe said: \"There has been a big focus on us this week because it is the 20th anniversary, and it has been a tough week, but I have had lots to do making sure everything for this memorial was going to plan.\n\n\"I haven\u0027t had time to sit with my own thoughts, but once this day has passed I will shut my front door and sit quietly with my own reflections.\"\n\nMany survivors and bereaved relatives were too emotional to talk about their still-raw pain. People who were not directly impacted by the blast came because they felt it was important to remember.\n\nAmong them Veronica McAfee, who said: \"My family would have been right here on Market Street had they not come to visit me in Belfast, so I came here in gratitude that my family were spared, but also in deep sympathy for those who did lose loved ones.\"\n\nNo one has ever been prosecuted for this massacre of innocents, something that still causes intense pain to the people of Omagh.\n\nDot Kerr is among them. She said: \"We have to remember those people on a sunny day who shop, buy uniforms for the children and enjoy a nice day out - but then a car pulls up right here and their lives are over.\n\n\"He stepped out of the car, walked away to safety, blew the town to smithereens and left us devastated.\n\n\"People lost limbs, people lost family members, people lost their eyesight, so we come here to remember their pain and their loss and also to hope that those responsible well and truly get what they deserve.\n\n\"If it is not in the courts - and it might be that they are never held accountable - they will be held accountable by God.\"\n\nJim Montgomery said the horrors of Omagh is something he will live with forever and wonders if the bombers had any regrets.\n\nHe said: \"The sights and sounds that I heard here this day 20 years ago are as fresh in my head now as they were then.\n\n\"I often wonder if the people behind the bomb are tortured the way we have been, and I am not the worst by any account because no one belonging to me was killed or injured.\n\n\"I don\u0027t suppose they are, because they would have done the decent thing long before now and handed themselves in.\"\n\nAnne Falconer added: \"I wanted to come and show we will never forget.\"\n\nAs the short service drew to a close and the clergy asked the people of Omagh to once again bow their heads for a final blessing, Catholics and Protestants stood side by side and applauded in an act of defiance to those who brought death and destruction to their town in 1998.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ring master frampton puts on a show for fans","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celebrities and social media stars investigated for not labelling posts","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Posts on social media aren’t always what they seem. We’ve opened an investigation into whether social media influencers are clearly labelling paid for endorsements: \nhttps://t.co/455k1lC4S7\n \npic.twitter/22CEJEtGLP\n\n— Competition \u0026 Markets Authority (@CMAgovUK) \nAugust 16, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIt has written to a range of celebrities and social media influencers to “gather more information about their posts and the nature of the business agreements they have in place with brands”.\n\nIt is also asking the public to share their experiences as part of the investigation, and said it was particularly interested in hearing from people who had bought products which were endorsed on social media.\n\nTypically, celebrities and influencers have millions of followers who watch their channels to see where they go on holiday, what they wear, which products they use, the books they read and more.\n\nOnline endorsements from celebrities and influencers can help brands reach target audiences and boost sales.\n\nHowever, influencers must make it clear in such posts that they have been paid or rewarded to promote, review or talk about a product in their social media feeds under consumer protection law.\n\nThe CMA said fans or followers could be led to believe that an endorsement represents the star’s own view, rather than it being a paid-for promotion, if they do not label their posts properly.\n\nIt said it was investigating the extent to which influencers are clearly and accurately identifying any commercial relationships, and whether people are being misled.\n\nGeorge Lusty, the CMA’s senior director for consumer protection, said: “Social media stars can have a big influence on what their followers do and buy.\n\n“If people see clothes, cosmetics, a car, or holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it.\n\n“So, it’s really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mps would vote on paisleys commons suspension if he resigns to force byelection","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

When kids are dedicated and they’re smashing it and getting great results, that’s difficult.”\n\nStormzy was joined by his former headteacher Carolyn English and English tutor Claudette Bergin, who also taught singer Adele.\n\nThey confirmed that the Shut Up star was a hard worker as a student and stayed after school hours had finished to study.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"would you be prepared to go on the worlds fastest tallest dive roller coaster","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.
